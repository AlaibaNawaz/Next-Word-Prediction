I wish\\n  to state definitely that the present work, the English\\n  translation of which has been authorised and approved by\\n  me, is the only authentic manual of the Montessori method,\\n  and that the only other authentic or authorised works of\\n  mine in the English language are \"The Montessori Method,\"\\n  and \"Pedagogical Anthropology.\"\\n\\n                                  [Signed: Maria Montessori]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\n\\nIf a preface is a light which should serve to illumine the contents of\\na volume, I choose, not words, but human figures to illustrate this\\nlittle book intended to enter families where children are growing up.\\nI therefore recall here, as an eloquent symbol, Helen Keller and Mrs.\\nAnne Sullivan Macy, who are, by their example, both teachers to\\nmyself--and, before the world, living documents of the miracle in\\neducation.\\n\\nIn fact, Helen Keller is a marvelous example of the phenomenon common\\nto all human beings: the possibility of the liberation of the\\nimprisoned spirit of man by the education of the senses. Here lies the\\nbasis of the method of education of which the book gives a succinct\\nidea.\\n\\nIf one only of the senses sufficed to make of Helen Keller a woman of\\nexceptional culture and a writer, who better than she proves the\\npotency of that method of education which builds on the senses? If\\nHelen Keller attained through exquisite natural gifts to an elevated\\nconception of the world, who better than she proves that in the\\ninmost self of man lies the spirit ready to reveal itself?\\n\\nHelen, clasp to your heart these little children, since they, above\\nall others, will understand you. They are your younger brothers: when,\\nwith bandaged eyes and in silence, they touch with their little hands,\\nprofound impressions rise in their consciousness, and they exclaim\\nwith a new form of happiness: \"I see with my hands.\" They alone, then,\\ncan fully understand the drama of the mysterious privilege your soul\\nhas known. When, in darkness and in silence, their spirit left free to\\nexpand, their intellectual energy redoubled, they become able to read\\nand write without having learnt, almost as it were by intuition, they,\\nonly they, can understand in part the ecstasy which God granted you on\\nthe luminous path of learning.\\n\\nMARIA MONTESSORI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\n\\n                                                                  PAGE\\n PREFACE                                                           vii\\n INTRODUCTORY REMARKS                                                1\\n A \"CHILDREN\\'S HOUSE\"                                                9\\n THE METHOD                                                         17\\n     Didactic Material for the Education of the Senses              18\\n     Didactic Material for the Preparation of Writing\\n         and Arithmetic                                             19\\n MOTOR EDUCATION                                                    20\\n SENSORY EDUCATION                                                  29\\n LANGUAGE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD                                69\\n FREEDOM                                                            77\\n WRITING                                                            80\\n     Exercises for the Management of the Instrument of\\n         Writing                                                    86\\n     Exercises for the Writing of Alphabetical Signs                92\\n THE READING OF MUSIC                                               98\\n ARITHMETIC                                                        102\\n MORAL FACTORS                                                     114\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nILLUSTRATIONS\\n\\n\\n Dr. Maria Montessori                                   _Frontispiece_\\n\\n FIG.

MONTESSORI\\'S OWN HANDBOOK\\n\\n\\nRecent years have seen a remarkable improvement in the conditions of\\nchild life. In all civilized countries, but especially in England,\\nstatistics show a decrease in infant mortality.\\n\\nRelated to this decrease in mortality a corresponding improvement is\\nto be seen in the physical development of children; they are\\nphysically finer and more vigorous. It has been the diffusion, the\\npopularization of science, which has brought about such notable\\nadvantages. Mothers have learned to welcome the dictates of modern\\nhygiene and to put them into practice in bringing up their children.\\nMany new social institutions have sprung up and have been perfected\\nwith the object of assisting children and protecting them during the\\nperiod of physical growth.\\n\\nIn this way what is practically a new race is coming into being, a\\nrace more highly developed, finer and more robust; a race which will\\nbe capable of offering resistance to insidious disease.\\n\\nWhat has science done to effect this? Science has suggested for us\\ncertain very simple rules by which the child has been restored as\\nnearly as possible to conditions of a natural life, and an order and a\\nguiding law have been given to the functions of the body. For example,\\nit is science which suggested maternal feeding, the abolition of\\nswaddling clothes, baths, life in the open air, exercise, simple short\\nclothing, quiet and plenty of sleep. Rules were also laid down for the\\nmeasurement of food adapting it rationally to the physiological needs\\nof the child\\'s life.\\n\\nYet with all this, science made no contribution that was entirely new.\\nMothers had always nursed their children, children had always been\\nclothed, they had breathed and eaten before.\\n\\nThe point is, that the same physical acts which, performed blindly and\\nwithout order, led to disease and death, when ordered _rationally_\\nwere the means of giving strength and life.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe great progress made may perhaps deceive us into thinking that\\neverything possible has been done for children.\\n\\nWe have only to weigh the matter carefully, however, to reflect: Are\\nour children only those healthy little bodies which to-day are growing\\nand developing so vigorously under our eyes? Is their destiny\\nfulfilled in the production of beautiful human bodies?\\n\\nIn that case there would be little difference between their lot and\\nthat of the animals which we raise that we may have good meat or\\nbeasts of burden.\\n\\nMan\\'s destiny is evidently other than this, and the care due to the\\nchild covers a field wider than that which is considered by physical\\nhygiene. The mother who has given her child his bath and sent him in\\nhis perambulator to the park has not fulfilled the mission of the\\n\"mother of humanity.\" The hen which gathers her chickens together, and\\nthe cat which licks her kittens and lavishes on them such tender care,\\ndiffer in no wise from the human mother in the services they render.\\n\\nNo, the human mother if reduced to such limits devotes herself in\\nvain, feels that a higher aspiration has been stifled within her. She\\nis yet the mother of man.\\n\\nChildren must grow not only in the body but in the spirit, and the\\nmother longs to follow the mysterious spiritual journey of the\\nbeloved one who to-morrow will be the intelligent, divine creation,\\nman.\\n\\nScience evidently has not finished its progress. On the contrary, it\\nhas scarcely taken the first step in advance, for it has hitherto\\nstopped at the welfare of the body. It must continue, however, to\\nadvance; on the same positive lines along which it has improved the\\nhealth and saved the physical life of the children, it is bound in the\\nfuture to benefit and to reenforce their inner life, which is the real\\n_human life_. On the same positive lines science will proceed to\\ndirect the development of the intelligence, of character, and of those\\nlatent creative forces which lie hidden in the marvelous embryo of\\nman\\'s spirit.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAs the child\\'s body must draw nourishment and oxygen from its external\\nenvironment, in order to accomplish a great physiological work, the\\n_work of growth_, so also the spirit must take from its environment\\nthe nourishment which it needs to develop according to its own \"laws\\nof growth.\" It cannot be denied that the phenomena of development are\\na great work in themselves. The consolidation of the bones, the\\ngrowth of the whole body, the completion of the minute construction of\\nthe brain, the formation of the teeth, all these are very real labors\\nof the physiological organism, as is also the transformation which the\\norganism undergoes during the period of puberty.\\n\\nThese exertions are very different from those put forth by mankind in\\nso-called _external work_, that is to say, in \"social production,\"\\nwhether in the schools where man is taught, or in the world where, by\\nthe activity of his intelligence, he produces wealth and transforms\\nhis environment.\\n\\nIt is none the less true, however, that they are both \"work.\" In fact,\\nthe organism during these periods of greatest physiological work is\\nleast capable of performing external tasks, and sometimes the work of\\ngrowth is of such extent and difficulty that the individual is\\noverburdened, as with an excessive strain, and for this reason alone\\nbecomes exhausted or even dies.\\n\\nMan will always be able to avoid \"external work\" by making use of the\\nlabor of others, but there is no possibility of shirking that inner\\nwork. Together with birth and death it has been imposed by nature\\nitself, and each man must accomplish it for himself. This difficult,\\ninevitable labor, this is the \"work of the child.\"\\n\\nWhen we say then that little children should _rest_, we are referring\\nto one side only of the question of work. We mean that they should\\nrest from that _external_ visible work to which the little child\\nthrough his weakness and incapacity cannot make any contribution\\nuseful either to himself or to others.\\n\\nOur assertion, therefore, is not absolute; the child in reality is\\nnot resting, he is performing the mysterious inner work of his\\nautoformation. He is working to make a man, and to accomplish this it\\nis not enough that the child\\'s body should grow in actual size; the\\nmost intimate functions of the motor and nervous systems must also\\nbe established and the intelligence developed.\\n\\nThe functions to be established by the child fall into two groups:\\n(1) the motor functions by which he is to secure his balance and\\nlearn to walk, and to coordinate his movements; (2) the sensory\\nfunctions through which, receiving sensations from his environment,\\nhe lays the foundations of his intelligence by a continual exercise\\nof observation, comparison and judgment. In this way he gradually\\ncomes to be acquainted with his environment and to develop his\\nintelligence.\\n\\nAt the same time he is learning a _language_, and he is faced not only\\nwith the motor difficulties of articulation, sounds and words, but\\nalso with the difficulty of gaining an intelligent understanding of\\nnames and of the syntactical composition of the language.\\n\\nIf we think of an emigrant who goes to a new country ignorant of its\\nproducts, ignorant of its natural appearance and social order,\\nentirely ignorant of its language, we realize that there is an immense\\nwork of adaptation which he must perform before he can associate\\nhimself with the active life of the unknown people. No one will be\\nable to do for him that work of adaptation. He himself must observe,\\nunderstand, remember, form judgments, and learn the new language by\\nlaborious exercise and long experience.\\n\\nWhat is to be said then of the child? What of this emigrant who comes\\ninto a new world, who, weak as he is and before his organism is\\ncompletely developed, _must_ in a short time adapt himself to a world\\nso complex?\\n\\nUp to the present day the little child has not received rational aid\\nin the accomplishment of this laborious task. As regards the psychical\\ndevelopment of the child we find ourselves in a period parallel to\\nthat in which the physical life was left to the mercy of chance and\\ninstinct--the period in which infant mortality was a scourge.\\n\\nIt is by scientific and rational means also that we must facilitate\\nthat inner work of psychical adaptation to be accomplished within the\\nchild, a work which is by no means the same thing as \"any external\\nwork or production whatsoever.\"\\n\\nThis is the aim which underlies my method of infant education, and it\\nis for this reason that certain principles which it enunciates,\\ntogether with that part which deals with the technique of their\\npractical application, are not of a general character, but have\\nspecial reference to the particular case of the child from three to\\nseven years of age, _i.e._, to the needs of a formative period of\\nlife.\\n\\nMy method is scientific, both in its substance and in its aim. It\\nmakes for the attainment of a more advanced stage of progress, in\\ndirections no longer only material and physiological. It is an\\nendeavor to complete the course which hygiene has already taken, but\\nin the treatment of the physical side alone.\\n\\nIf to-day we possessed statistics respecting the nervous debility,\\ndefects of speech, errors of perception and of reasoning, and lack of\\ncharacter in normal children, it would perhaps be interesting to\\ncompare them with statistics of the same nature, but compiled from the\\nstudy of children who have had a number of years of rational\\neducation. In all probability we should find a striking resemblance\\nbetween such statistics and those to-day available showing the\\ndecrease in mortality and the improvement in the physical development\\nof children.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA \"CHILDREN\\'S HOUSE\"\\n\\n\\nThe \"Children\\'s House\" is the _environment_ which is offered to the\\nchild that he may be given the opportunity of developing his\\nactivities. This kind of school is not of a fixed type, but may vary\\naccording to the financial resources at disposal and to the\\nopportunities afforded by the environment. It ought to be a real\\nhouse; that is to say, a set of rooms with a garden of which the\\nchildren are the masters. A garden which contains shelters is ideal,\\nbecause the children can play or sleep under them, and can also bring\\ntheir tables out to work or dine. In this way they may live almost\\nentirely in the open air, and are protected at the same time from rain\\nand sun.\\n\\nThe central and principal room of the building, often also the only\\nroom at the disposal of the children, is the room for \"intellectual\\nwork.\" To this central room can be added other smaller rooms according\\nto the means and opportunities of the place: for example, a bathroom,\\na dining-room, a little parlor or common-room, a room for manual work,\\na gymnasium and rest-room.\\n\\nThe special characteristic of the equipment of these houses is that it\\nis adapted for children and not adults. They contain not only didactic\\nmaterial specially fitted for the intellectual development of the\\nchild, but also a complete equipment for the management of the\\nminiature family. The furniture is light so that the children can move\\nit about, and it is painted in some light color so that the children\\ncan wash it with soap and water. There are low tables of various\\nsizes and shapes--square, rectangular and round, large and small. The\\nrectangular shape is the most common as two or more children can work\\nat it together. The seats are small wooden chairs, but there are also\\nsmall wicker armchairs and sofas.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--CUPBOARD WITH APPARATUS.]\\n\\nIn the working-room there are two indispensable pieces of furniture.\\nOne of these is a very long cupboard with large doors. (Fig. 1.) It is\\nvery low so that a small child can set on the top of it small objects\\nsuch as mats, flowers, etc. Inside this cupboard is kept the didactic\\nmaterial which is the common property of all the children.\\n\\nThe other is a chest of drawers containing two or three columns of\\nlittle drawers, each of which has a bright handle (or a handle of some\\ncolor to contrast with the background), and a small card with a name\\nupon it. Every child has his own drawer, in which to put things\\nbelonging to him.\\n\\nRound the walls of the room are fixed blackboards at a low level, so\\nthat the children can write or draw on them, and pleasing, artistic\\npictures, which are changed from time to time as circumstances direct.\\nThe pictures represent children, families, landscapes, flowers and\\nfruit, and more often Biblical and historical incidents. Ornamental\\nplants and flowering plants ought always to be placed in the room\\nwhere the children are at work.\\n\\nAnother part of the working-room\\'s equipment is seen in the pieces of\\ncarpet of various colors--red, blue, pink, green and brown. The\\nchildren spread these rugs upon the floor, sit upon them and work\\nthere with the didactic material. A room of this kind is larger than\\nthe customary class-rooms, not only because the little tables and\\nseparate chairs take up more space, but also because a large part of\\nthe floor must be free for the children to spread their rugs and work\\nupon them.\\n\\nIn the sitting-room, or \"club-room,\" a kind of parlor in which the\\nchildren amuse themselves by conversation, games, or music, etc., the\\nfurnishings should be especially tasteful. Little tables of different\\nsizes, little armchairs and sofas should be placed here and there.\\nMany brackets of all kinds and sizes, upon which may be put\\nstatuettes, artistic vases or framed photographs, should adorn the\\nwalls; and, above all, each child should have a little flower-pot, in\\nwhich he may sow the seed of some indoor plant, to tend and cultivate\\nit as it grows. On the tables of this sitting-room should be placed\\nlarge albums of colored pictures, and also games of patience, or\\nvarious geometric solids, with which the children can play at\\npleasure, constructing figures, etc. A piano, or, better, other\\nmusical instruments, possibly harps of small dimensions, made\\nespecially for children, completes the equipment. In this \"club-room\"\\nthe teacher may sometimes entertain the children with stories, which\\nwill attract a circle of interested listeners.\\n\\nThe furniture of the dining-room consists, in addition to the tables,\\nof low cupboards accessible to all the children, who can themselves\\nput in their place and take away the crockery, spoons, knives and\\nforks, table-cloth and napkins. The plates are always of china, and\\nthe tumblers and water-bottles of glass. Knives are always included in\\nthe table equipment.\\n\\n_The Dressing-room._ Here each child has his own little cupboard or\\nshelf. In the middle of the room there are very simple washstands,\\nconsisting of tables, on each of which stand a small basin, soap and\\nnail-brush. Against the wall stand little sinks with water-taps. Here\\nthe children may draw and pour away their water. There is no limit to\\nthe equipment of the \"Children\\'s Houses\" because the children\\nthemselves do everything. They sweep the rooms, dust and wash the\\nfurniture, polish the brasses, lay and clear away the table, wash up,\\nsweep and roll up the rugs, wash a few little clothes, and cook eggs.\\nAs regards their personal toilet, the children know how to dress and\\nundress themselves. They hang their clothes on little hooks, placed\\nvery low so as to be within reach of a little child, or else they fold\\nup such articles of clothing, as their little serving-aprons, of which\\nthey take great care, and lay them inside a cupboard kept for the\\nhousehold linen.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIn short, where the manufacture of toys has been brought to such a\\npoint of complication and perfection that children have at their\\ndisposal entire dolls\\' houses, complete wardrobes for the dressing and\\nundressing of dolls, kitchens where they can pretend to cook, toy\\nanimals as nearly lifelike as possible, this method seeks to give all\\nthis to the child in reality--making him an actor in a living scene.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG 2.--THE MONTESSORI PAEDOMETER.]\\n\\nMy pedometer forms part of the equipment of a \"Children\\'s House.\"\\nAfter various modifications I have now reduced this instrument to a\\nvery practical form. (Fig. 2.)\\n\\nThe purpose of the pedometer, as its name shows, is to measure the\\nchildren. It consists of a wide rectangular board, forming the base,\\nfrom the center of which rise two wooden posts held together at the\\ntop by a narrow flat piece of metal. To each post is connected a\\nhorizontal metal rod--the indicator--which runs up and down by means\\nof a casing, also of metal. This metal casing is made in one piece\\nwith the indicator, to the end of which is fixed an india-rubber ball.\\nOn one side, that is to say, behind one of the two tall vertical\\nwooden posts, there is a small seat, also of wood. The two tall wooden\\nposts are graduated. The post to which the seat is fixed is graduated\\nfrom the surface of the seat to the top, whilst the other is graduated\\nfrom the wooden board at the base to the top, _i.e._ to a height of\\n1.5 meters. On the side containing the seat the height of the child\\nseated is measured, on the other side the child\\'s full stature. The\\npractical value of this instrument lies in the possibility of\\nmeasuring two children at the same time, and in the fact that the\\nchildren themselves cooperate in taking the measurements. In fact,\\nthey learn to take off their shoes and to place themselves in the\\ncorrect position on the pedometer. They find no difficulty in raising\\nand lowering the metal indicators, which are held so firmly in place\\nby means of the metal casing that they cannot deviate from their\\nhorizontal position even when used by inexpert hands. Moreover they\\nrun extremely easily, so that very little strength is required to move\\nthem. The little india-rubber balls prevent the children from hurting\\nthemselves should they inadvertently knock their heads against the\\nmetal indicator.\\n\\nThe children are very fond of the pedometer. \"Shall we measure\\nourselves?\" is one of the proposals which they make most willingly and\\nwith the greatest likelihood of finding many of their companions to\\njoin them. They also take great care of the pedometer, dusting it, and\\npolishing its metal parts. All the surfaces of the pedometer are so\\nsmooth and well polished that they invite the care that is taken of\\nthem, and by their appearance when finished fully repay the trouble\\ntaken.\\n\\nThe pedometer represents the scientific part of the method, because it\\nhas reference to the anthropological and psychological study made of\\nthe children, each of whom has his own biographical record. This\\nbiographical record follows the history of the child\\'s development\\naccording to the observations which it is possible to make by the\\napplication of my method. This subject is dealt with at length in my\\nother books. A series of cinematograph pictures has been taken of the\\npedometer at a moment when the children are being measured. They are\\nseen coming of their own accord, even the very smallest, to take their\\nplaces at the instrument.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE METHOD\\n\\n\\nThe technique of my method as it follows the guidance of the natural\\nphysiological and psychical development of the child, may be divided\\ninto three parts:\\n\\n  Motor education.\\n  Sensory education.\\n  Language.\\n\\nThe care and management of the environment itself afford the principal\\nmeans of motor education, while sensory education and the education of\\nlanguage are provided for by my didactic material.\\n\\nThe didactic material for the _education of the senses_ consists of:\\n\\n  (_a_) Three sets of solid insets.\\n  (_b_) Three sets of solids in graduated sizes, comprising:\\n        (1) Pink cubes.\\n        (2) Brown prisms.\\n        (3) Rods: (_a_) colored green; (_b_) colored alternately\\n            red and blue.\\n  (_c_) Various geometric solids (prism, pyramid, sphere, cylinder,\\n          cone, etc.).\\n  (_d_) Rectangular tablets with rough and smooth surfaces.\\n  (_e_) A collection of various stuffs.\\n  (_f_) Small wooden tablets of different weights.\\n  (_g_) Two boxes, each containing sixty-four colored tablets.\\n  (_h_) A chest of drawers containing plane insets.\\n  (_i_) Three series of cards on which are pasted geometrical forms\\n          in paper.\\n  (_k_) A collection of cylindrical closed boxes (sounds).\\n  (_l_) A double series of musical bells, wooden boards on which are\\n          painted the lines used in music, small wooden discs for\\n          the notes.\\n\\n\\n_Didactic Material for the Preparation for Writing and Arithmetic_\\n\\n  (_m_) Two sloping desks and various iron insets.\\n  (_n_) Cards on which are pasted sandpaper letters.\\n  (_o_) Two alphabets of colored cardboard and\\n          of different sizes.\\n  (_p_) A series of cards on which are pasted sandpaper\\n          figures (1, 2, 3, etc.).\\n  (_q_) A series of large cards bearing the same\\n          figures in smooth paper for the enumeration\\n          of numbers above ten.\\n  (_r_) Two boxes with small sticks for counting.\\n  (_s_) The volume of drawings belonging specially\\n          to the method, and colored pencils.\\n  (_t_) The frames for lacing, buttoning, etc., which\\n          are used for the education of the movements\\n          of the hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOTOR EDUCATION\\n\\n\\nThe education of the movements is very complex, as it must correspond\\nto all the coordinated movements which the child has to establish in\\nhis physiological organism. The child, if left without guidance, is\\ndisorderly in his movements, and these disorderly movements are the\\n_special characteristic of the little child._ In fact, he \"never keeps\\nstill,\" and \"touches everything.\" This is what forms the child\\'s\\nso-called \"unruliness\" and \"naughtiness.\"\\n\\nThe adult would deal with him by checking these movements, with the\\nmonotonous and useless repetition \"keep still.\" As a matter of fact,\\nin these movements the little one is seeking the very exercise which\\nwill organize and coordinate the movements useful to man. We must,\\ntherefore, desist from the useless attempt to reduce the child to a\\nstate of immobility. We should rather give \"order\" to his movements,\\nleading them to those actions towards which his efforts are actually\\ntending. This is the aim of muscular education at this age. Once a\\ndirection is given to them, the child\\'s movements are made towards a\\ndefinite end, so that he himself grows quiet and contented, and\\nbecomes an active worker, a being calm and full of joy. This education\\nof the movements is one of the principal factors in producing that\\noutward appearance of \"discipline\" to be found in the \"Children\\'s\\nHouses.\" I have already spoken at length on this subject in my other\\nbooks.\\n\\nMuscular education has reference to:\\n\\n  The primary movements of everyday life (walking, rising, sitting,\\n    handling objects).\\n  The care of the person.\\n  Management of the household.\\n  Gardening.\\n  Manual work.\\n  Gymnastic exercises.\\n  Rhythmic movements.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--FRAMES FOR LACING AND BUTTONING.]\\n\\nIn the care of the person the first step is that of dressing and\\nundressing. For this end there is in my didactic material a collection\\nof frames to which are attached pieces of stuff, leather, etc. These\\ncan be buttoned, hooked, tied together--in fact, joined in all the\\ndifferent ways which our civilization has invented for fastening our\\nclothing, shoes, etc. (Fig. 3.) The teacher, sitting by the child\\'s\\nside, performs the necessary movements of the fingers very slowly and\\ndeliberately, separating the movements themselves into their different\\nparts, and letting them be seen clearly and minutely.\\n\\nFor example, one of the first actions will be the adjustment of the\\ntwo pieces of stuff in such a way that the edges to be fastened\\ntogether touch one another from top to bottom. Then, if it is a\\nbuttoning-frame, the teacher will show the child the different stages\\nof the action. She will take hold of the button, set it opposite the\\nbuttonhole, make it enter the buttonhole completely, and adjust it\\ncarefully in its place above. In the same way, to teach a child to tie\\na bow, she will separate the stage in which he ties the ribbons\\ntogether from that in which he makes the bows.\\n\\nIn the cinematograph film there is a picture which shows an entire\\nlesson in the tying of the bows with the ribbons. These lessons are\\nnot necessary for all the children, as they learn from one another,\\nand of their own accord come with great patience to analyze the\\nmovements, performing them separately very slowly and carefully. The\\nchild can sit in a comfortable position and hold his frame on the\\ntable. (Fig. 4.) As he fastens and unfastens the same frame many times\\nover with great interest, he acquires an unusual deftness of hand, and\\nbecomes possessed with the desire to fasten real clothes whenever he\\nhas the opportunity. We see the smallest children _wanting_ to dress\\nthemselves and their companions. They go in search of amusement of\\nthis kind, and defend themselves with all their might against the\\nadult who would try to help them.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--CHILD BUTTONING ON FRAME. (PHOTO TAKEN AT MR.\\nHAWKER\\'S SCHOOL AT RUNTON.)]\\n\\nIn the same way for the teaching of the other and larger movements,\\nsuch as washing, setting the table, etc., the directress must at the\\nbeginning intervene, teaching the child with few or no words at all,\\nbut with very precise actions. She teaches all the movements: how to\\nsit, to rise from one\\'s seat, to take up and lay down objects, and to\\noffer them gracefully to others. In the same way she teaches the\\nchildren to set the plates one upon the other and lay them on the\\ntable without making any noise.\\n\\nThe children learn easily and show an interest and surprising care in\\nthe performance of these actions. In classes where there are many\\nchildren it is necessary to arrange for the children to take turns in\\nthe various household duties, such as housework, serving at table, and\\nwashing dishes. The children readily respect such a system of turns.\\nThere is no need to ask them to do this work, for they come\\nspontaneously--even little ones of two and a half years old--to offer\\nto do their share, and it is frequently most touching to watch their\\nefforts to imitate, to remember, and, finally, to conquer their\\ndifficulty. Professor Jacoby, of New York, was once much moved as he\\nwatched a child, who was little more than two years old and not at all\\nintelligent in appearance, standing perplexed, because he could not\\nremember whether the fork should be set at the right hand or the left.\\nHe remained a long while meditating and evidently using all the powers\\nof his mind. The other children older than he watched him with\\nadmiration, marveling, like ourselves, at the life developing under\\nour eyes.\\n\\nThe instructions of the teacher consist then merely in a hint, a\\ntouch--enough to give a start to the child. The rest develops of\\nitself. The children learn from one another and throw themselves into\\nthe work with enthusiasm and delight. This atmosphere of quiet\\nactivity develops a fellow-feeling, an attitude of mutual aid, and,\\nmost wonderful of all, an intelligent interest on the part of the\\nolder children in the progress of their little companions. It is\\nenough just to set a child in these peaceful surroundings for him to\\nfeel perfectly at home. In the cinematograph pictures the actual work\\nin a \"Children\\'s House\" may be seen. The children are moving about,\\neach one fulfilling his own task, whilst the teacher is in a corner\\nwatching. Pictures were taken also of the children engaged in the care\\nof the house, that is, in the care both of their persons and of their\\nsurroundings. They can be seen washing their faces, polishing their\\nshoes, washing the furniture, polishing the metal indicators of the\\npedometer, brushing the carpets, etc. In the work of laying the table\\nthe children are seen quite by themselves, dividing the work among\\nthemselves, carrying the plates, spoons, knives and forks, etc., and,\\nfinally, sitting down at the tables where the little waitresses serve\\nthe hot soup.\\n\\nAgain, gardening and manual work are a great pleasure to our children.\\nGardening is already well known as a feature of infant education, and\\nit is recognized by all that plants and animals attract the children\\'s\\ncare and attention. The ideal of the \"Children\\'s Houses\" in this\\nrespect is to imitate the best in the present usage of those schools\\nwhich owe their inspiration more or less to Mrs. Latter.\\n\\nFor manual instruction we have chosen clay work, consisting of the\\nconstruction of little tiles, vases and bricks. These may be made with\\nthe help of simple instruments, such as molds. The completion of the\\nwork should be the aim always kept in view, and, finally, all the\\nlittle objects made by the children should be glazed and baked in the\\nfurnace. The children themselves learn to line a wall with shining\\nwhite or colored tiles wrought in various designs, or, with the help\\nof mortar and a trowel, to cover the floor with little bricks. They\\nalso dig out foundations and then use their bricks to build division\\nwalls, or entire little houses for the chickens.\\n\\nAmong the gymnastic exercises that which must be considered the most\\nimportant is that of the \"line.\" A line is described in chalk or\\npaint upon a large space of floor. Instead of one line, there may also\\nbe two concentric lines, elliptical in form. The children are taught\\nto walk upon these lines like tight-rope walkers, placing their feet\\none in front of the other. To keep their balance they make efforts\\nexactly similar to those of real tight-rope walkers, except that they\\nhave no danger with which to reckon, as the lines are only _drawn_\\nupon the floor. The teacher herself performs the exercise, showing\\nclearly how she sets her feet, and the children imitate her without\\nany necessity for her to speak. At first it is only certain children\\nwho follow her, and when she has shown them how to do it, she\\nwithdraws, leaving the phenomenon to develop of itself.\\n\\nThe children for the most part continue to walk, adapting their feet\\nwith great care to the movement they have seen, and making efforts to\\nkeep their balance so as not to fall. Gradually the other children\\ndraw near and watch and also make an attempt. Very little time elapses\\nbefore the whole of the two ellipses or the one line is covered with\\nchildren balancing themselves, and continuing to walk round, watching\\ntheir feet with an expression of deep attention on their faces.\\n\\nMusic may then be used. It should be a very simple march, the rhythm\\nof which is not obvious at first, but which accompanies and enlivens\\nthe spontaneous efforts of the children.\\n\\nWhen they have learned in this way to master their balance the\\nchildren have brought the act of walking to a remarkable standard of\\nperfection, and have acquired, in addition to security and composure\\nin their natural gait, an unusually graceful carriage of the body. The\\nexercise on the line can afterwards be made more complicated in\\nvarious ways. The first application is that of calling forth rhythmic\\nexercise by the sound of a march upon the piano. When the same march\\nis repeated during several days, the children end by feeling the\\nrhythm and by following it with movements of their arms and feet. They\\nalso accompany the exercises on the line with songs.\\n\\nLittle by little the music is _understood_ by the children. They\\nfinish, as in Miss George\\'s school at Washington, by singing over\\ntheir daily work with the didactic material. The \"Children\\'s House,\"\\nthen, resembles a hive of bees humming as they work.\\n\\nAs to the little gymnasium, of which I speak in my book on the\\n\"Method,\" one piece of apparatus is particularly practical. This is\\nthe \"fence,\" from which the children hang by their arms, freeing their\\nlegs from the heavy weight of the body and strengthening the arms.\\nThis fence has also the advantage of being useful in a garden for the\\npurpose of dividing one part from another, as, for example, the\\nflower-beds from the garden walks, and it does not detract in any way\\nfrom the appearance of the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSENSORY EDUCATION\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--CYLINDERS DECREASING IN DIAMETER ONLY.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--CYLINDERS DECREASING IN DIAMETER AND HEIGHT.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--CYLINDERS DECREASING IN HEIGHT ONLY.]\\n\\nMy didactic material offers to the child the _means_ for what may be\\ncalled \"sensory education.\"\\n\\nIn the box of material the first three objects which are likely to\\nattract the attention of a little child from two and a half to three\\nyears old are three solid pieces of wood, in each of which is inserted\\na row of ten small cylinders, or sometimes discs, all furnished with a\\nbutton for a handle. In the first case there is a row of cylinders of\\nthe same height, but with a diameter which decreases from thick to\\nthin. (Fig. 5.) In the second there are cylinders which decrease in\\nall dimensions, and so are either larger or smaller, but always of the\\nsame shape. (Fig. 6.)\\n\\nLastly, in the third case, the cylinders have the same diameter but\\nvary in height, so that, as the size decreases, the cylinder gradually\\nbecomes a little disc in form. (Fig. 7.)\\n\\nThe first cylinders vary in two dimensions (the section); the second\\nin all three dimensions; the third in one dimension (height). The\\norder which I have given refers to the degree of _ease_ with which the\\nchild performs the exercises.\\n\\nThe exercise consists in taking out the cylinders, mixing them and\\nputting them back in the right place. It is performed by the child as\\nhe sits in a comfortable position at a little table. He exercises his\\nhands in the delicate act of taking hold of the button with the tips\\nof one or two fingers, and in the little movements of the hand and arm\\nas he mixes the cylinders, _without letting them fall_ and _without\\nmaking too much noise_ and puts them back again each in its own\\nplace.\\n\\nIn these exercises the teacher may, in the first instance, intervene,\\nmerely taking out the cylinders, mixing them carefully on the table\\nand then showing the child that he is to put them back, but without\\nperforming the action herself. Such intervention, however, is almost\\nalways found to be unnecessary, for the children _see_ their\\ncompanions at work, and thus are encouraged to imitate them.\\n\\nThey like to do it _alone_; in fact, sometimes almost in private for\\nfear of inopportune help. (Fig. 8.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--CHILD USING CASE OF CYLINDERS.]\\n\\nBut how is the child to find the right place for each of the little\\ncylinders which lie mixed upon the table? He first makes trials; it\\noften happens that he places a cylinder which is too large for the\\nempty hole over which he puts it. Then, changing its place, he tries\\nothers until the cylinder goes in. Again, the contrary may happen;\\nthat is to say, the cylinder may slip too easily into a hole too big\\nfor it. In that case it has taken a place which does not belong to it\\nat all, but to a larger cylinder. In this way one cylinder at the end\\nwill be left out without a place, and it will not be possible to find\\none that fits. Here the child cannot help seeing his mistake in\\nconcrete form. He is perplexed, his little mind is faced with a\\nproblem which interests him intensely. Before, all the cylinders\\nfitted, now there is one that will not fit. The little one stops,\\nfrowning, deep in thought. He begins to feel the little buttons and\\nfinds that some cylinders have too much room. He thinks that perhaps\\nthey are out of their right place and tries to place them correctly.\\nHe repeats the process again and again, and finally he succeeds. Then\\nit is that he breaks into a smile of triumph. The exercise arouses the\\nintelligence of the child; he wants to repeat it right from the\\nbeginning and, having learned by experience, he makes another attempt.\\nLittle children from three to three and a half years old have repeated\\nthe exercise up to _forty_ times without losing their interest in it.\\n\\nIf the second set of cylinders and then the third are presented, the\\n_change_ of shape strikes the child and reawakens his interest.\\n\\nThe material which I have described serves to _educate the eye_ to\\ndistinguish _difference in dimension_, for the child ends by being\\nable to recognize at a glance the larger or the smaller hole which\\nexactly fits the cylinder which he holds in his hand. The educative\\nprocess is based on this: that the control of the error lies in _the\\nmaterial itself_, and the child has concrete evidence of it.\\n\\nThe desire of the child to attain an end which he knows, leads him to\\ncorrect himself. It is not a teacher who makes him notice his mistake\\nand shows him how to correct it, but it is a complex work of the\\nchild\\'s own intelligence which leads to such a result.\\n\\nHence at this point there begins the process of auto-education.\\n\\nThe aim is not an external one, that is to say, it is _not_ the object\\nthat the child should learn how to place the cylinders, and _that he\\nshould know how to perform an exercise_.\\n\\nThe aim is an inner one, namely, that the child train himself to\\nobserve; that he be led to make comparisons between objects, to form\\njudgments, to reason and to decide; and it is in the indefinite\\nrepetition of this exercise of attention and of intelligence that a\\nreal development ensues.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE TOWER.]\\n\\nThe series of objects to follow after the cylinders consists of three\\nsets of geometrical solid forms:\\n\\n(1) Ten wooden cubes colored pink. The sides of the cubes diminish\\nfrom ten centimeters to one centimeter. (Fig. 9.)\\n\\nWith these cubes the child builds a tower, first laying on the ground\\n(upon a carpet) the largest cube, and then placing on the top of it\\nall the others in their order of size to the very smallest. (Fig. 10.)\\nAs soon as he has built the tower, the child, with a blow of his hand,\\nknocks it down, so that the cubes are scattered on the carpet, and\\nthen he builds it up again.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--CHILD PLAYING WITH TOWER. (PHOTO TAKEN AT MR.\\nHAWKER\\'S SCHOOL AT RUNTON.)]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--THE BROAD STAIR.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--THE LONG STAIR.]\\n\\n(2) Ten wooden prisms, colored brown. The length of the prisms is\\ntwenty centimeters, and the square section diminishes from ten\\ncentimeters a side to the smallest, one centimeter a side. (Fig. 11.)\\n\\nThe child scatters the ten pieces over a light-colored carpet, and\\nthen beginning sometimes with the thickest, sometimes with the\\nthinnest, he places them in their right order of gradation upon a\\ntable.\\n\\n(3) Ten rods, colored green, or alternately red and blue, all of which\\nhave the same square section of four centimeters a side, but vary by\\nten centimeters in length from ten centimeters to one meter. (Fig.\\n12.)\\n\\nThe child scatters the ten rods on a large carpet and mixes them at\\nrandom, and, by comparing rod with rod, he arranges them according to\\ntheir order of length, so that they take the form of a set of organ\\npipes.\\n\\nAs usual, the teacher, by doing the exercises herself, first shows the\\nchild how the pieces of each set should be arranged, but it will often\\nhappen that the child learns, not directly from her, but by watching\\nhis companions. She will, however, always continue to watch the\\nchildren, never losing sight of their efforts, and any correction of\\nhers will be directed more towards preventing rough or disorderly use\\nof the material than towards any _error_ which the child may make in\\nplacing the rods in their order of gradation. The reason is that the\\nmistakes which the child makes, by placing, for example, a small cube\\nbeneath one that is larger, are caused by his own lack of education,\\nand it is the _repetition of the exercise_ which, by refining his\\npowers of observation, will lead him sooner or later to _correct_\\n_himself_. Sometimes it happens that a child working with the long\\nrods makes the most glaring mistakes. As the aim of the exercise,\\nhowever, is _not_ that the rods be arranged in the right order of\\ngradation, but that the child _should practise by himself_, there is\\nno need to intervene.\\n\\nOne day the child will arrange all the rods in their right order, and\\nthen, full of joy, he will call the teacher to come and admire them.\\nThe object of the exercise will thus be achieved.\\n\\nThese three sets, the cubes, the prisms, and the rods, cause the child\\nto move about and to handle and carry objects which are difficult for\\nhim to grasp with his little hand. Again, by their use, he repeats the\\n_training of the eye_ to the recognition of differences of size\\nbetween similar objects. The exercise would seem easier, from the\\nsensory point of view, than the other with the cylinders described\\nabove.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, it is more difficult, as there is _no control of\\nthe error in the material itself_. It is the child\\'s eye alone which\\ncan furnish the control.\\n\\nHence the difference between the objects should strike the eye at\\nonce; for that reason larger objects are used, and the necessary\\nvisual power presupposes a previous preparation (provided for in the\\nexercise with the solid insets).\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--BOARD WITH ROUGH AND SMOOTH SURFACES.]\\n\\nDuring the same period the child can be doing other exercises. Among\\nthe material is to be found a small rectangular board, the surface of\\nwhich is divided into two parts--rough and smooth. (Fig. 13.) The\\nchild knows already how to wash his hands with cold water and soap; he\\nthen dries them and dips the tips of his fingers for a few seconds in\\ntepid water. Graduated exercises for the thermic sense may also have\\ntheir place here, as has been explained in my book on the \"Method.\"\\n\\nAfter this, the child is taught to pass the soft cushioned tips of his\\nfingers _as lightly as possible_ over the two separate surfaces, that\\nhe may appreciate their difference. The delicate _movement_ backwards\\nand forwards of the suspended hand, as it is brought into light\\ncontact with the surface, is an excellent exercise in control. The\\nlittle hand, which has just been cleansed and given its tepid bath,\\ngains much in grace and beauty, and the whole exercise is the first\\nstep in the education of the \"tactile sense,\" which holds such an\\nimportant place in my method.\\n\\nWhen initiating the child into the education of the sense of touch,\\nthe teacher must always take an active part the first time; not only\\nmust she show the child \"how it is done,\" her interference is a little\\nmore definite still, for she takes hold of his hand and guides it to\\ntouch the surfaces with the finger-tips in the lightest possible way.\\nShe will make no explanations; her words will be rather to _encourage_\\nthe child with his hand to perceive the different sensations.\\n\\nWhen he has perceived them, it is then that he repeats the act by\\nhimself in the delicate way which he has been taught.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--BOARD WITH GUMMED STRIPS OF PAPER.]\\n\\nAfter the board with the two contrasting surfaces, the child is\\noffered another board on which are gummed strips of paper which are\\nrough or smooth in different degrees. (Fig. 14.)\\n\\nGraduated series of sandpaper cards are also given. The child perfects\\nhimself by exercises in touching these surfaces, not only refining his\\ncapacity for perceiving tactile differences which are always growing\\nmore similar, but also perfecting the movement of which he is ever\\ngaining greater mastery.\\n\\nFollowing these is a series of stuffs of every kind: velvets, satins,\\nsilks, woolens, cottons, coarse and fine linens. There are two similar\\npieces of each kind of stuff, and they are of bright and vivid\\ncolors.\\n\\nThe child is now taught a new movement. Where before he had to\\n_touch_, he must now _feel_ the stuffs, which, according to the\\ndegree of fineness or coarseness from coarse cotton to fine silk,\\nare felt with movements correspondingly decisive or delicate. The\\nchild whose hand is already practised finds the greatest pleasure\\nin feeling the stuffs, and, almost instinctively, in order to enhance\\nhis appreciation of the tactile sensation he closes his eyes.\\nThen, to spare himself the exertion, he blindfolds himself with a\\nclean handkerchief, and as he feels the stuffs, he arranges the\\nsimilar pieces in pairs, one upon the other, then, taking off the\\nhandkerchief, he ascertains for himself whether he has made any\\nmistake.\\n\\nThis exercise in _touching_ and _feeling_ is peculiarly attractive to\\nthe child, and induces him to seek similar experiences in his\\nsurroundings. A little one, attracted by the pretty stuff of a\\nvisitor\\'s dress, will be seen to go and wash his hands, then to come\\nand touch the stuff of the garment again and again with infinite\\ndelicacy, his face meanwhile expressing his pleasure and interest.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA little later we shall see the children interest themselves in a much\\nmore difficult exercise.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--WOOD TABLETS DIFFERING IN WEIGHT.]\\n\\nThere are some little rectangular tablets which form part of the\\nmaterial. (Fig. 15.) The tablets, though of identical size, are made\\nof wood of varying qualities, so that they differ in weight and,\\nthrough the property of the wood, in color also.\\n\\nThe child has to take a tablet and rest it delicately on the inner\\nsurfaces of his four fingers, spreading them well out. This will be\\nanother opportunity of teaching delicate movements.\\n\\nThe hand must move up and down as though to weigh the object, but the\\nmovement must be as imperceptible as possible. These little movements\\nshould diminish as the capacity and attention for perceiving the\\nweight of the object becomes more acute and the exercise will be\\nperfectly performed when the child comes to perceive the weight\\nalmost without any movement of the hands. It is only by the repetition\\nof the attempts that such a result can be obtained.\\n\\nOnce the children are initiated into it by the teacher, they blindfold\\ntheir eyes and repeat by themselves these exercises of the _baric\\nsense_. For example, they lay the heavier wooden tablets on the right\\nand the lighter on the left.\\n\\nWhen the child takes off the handkerchief, he can see by the color of\\nthe pieces of wood if he has made a mistake.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA long time before this difficult exercise, and during the period when\\nthe child is working with the three sorts of geometrical solids and\\nwith the rough and smooth tablets, he can be exercising himself with a\\nmaterial which is very attractive to him.\\n\\nThis is the set of tablets covered with bright silk of shaded colors.\\nThe set consists of two separate boxes each containing sixty-four\\ncolors; that is, eight different tints, each of which has eight shades\\ncarefully graded. The first exercise for the child is that of _pairing\\nthe colors_; that is, he selects from a mixed heap of colors the two\\ntablets which are alike, and lays them out, one beside the other. The\\nteacher naturally does not offer the child all the one hundred and\\ntwenty-eight tablets in a heap, but chooses only a few of the brighter\\ncolors, for example, red, blue and yellow, and prepares and mixes up\\nthree or four pairs. Then, taking one tablet--perhaps the red one--she\\nindicates to the child that he is to choose its counterpart from the\\nheap. This done, the teacher lays the pair together on the table. Then\\nshe takes perhaps the blue and the child selects the tablet to form\\nanother pair. The teacher then mixes the tablets again for the child\\nto repeat the exercise by himself, _i.e._, to select the two red\\ntablets, the two blue, the two yellow, etc., and to place the two\\nmembers of each pair next to one another.\\n\\nThen the couples will be increased to four or five, and little\\nchildren of three years old end by pairing of their own accord ten or\\na dozen couples of mixed tablets.\\n\\n[Illustration: COLOR SPOOLS]\\n\\nWhen the child has given his eye sufficient practise in recognizing\\nthe identity of the pairs of colors, he is offered the shades of one\\ncolor only, and he exercises himself in the perception of the\\nslightest differences of shade in every color. Take, for example, the\\nblue series. There are eight tablets in graduated shades. The teacher\\nplaces them one beside another, beginning with the darkest, with the\\nsole object of making the child understand \"what is to be done.\"\\n\\nShe then leaves him alone to the interesting attempts which he\\nspontaneously makes. It often happens that the child makes a mistake.\\nIf he has understood the idea and makes a mistake, it is a sign that\\n_he has not yet reached the stage_ of perceiving the differences\\nbetween the graduations of one color. It is practise which perfects in\\nthe child that capacity for distinguishing the fine differences, and\\nso we leave him alone to his attempts!\\n\\nThere are two suggestions that we can make to help him. The first is\\nthat he should always select the darkest color from the pile. This\\nsuggestion greatly facilitates his choice by giving it a constant\\ndirection.\\n\\nSecondly, we can lead him to observe from time to time any two colors\\nthat stand next to each other in order to compare them directly and\\napart from the others. In this way the child does not place a tablet\\nwithout a particular and careful comparison with its neighbor.\\n\\nFinally, the child himself will love to mix the sixty-four colors and\\nthen to arrange them in eight rows of pretty shades of color with\\nreally surprising skill. In this exercise also the child\\'s hand is\\neducated to perform fine and delicate movements and his mind is\\nafforded special training in attention. He must not take hold of the\\ntablets anyhow, he must avoid touching the colored silk, and must\\nhandle the tablets instead by the pieces of wood at the top and\\nbottom. To arrange the tablets next to one another in a straight line\\nat exactly the same level, so that the series looks like a beautiful\\nshaded ribbon, is an act which demands a manual skill only obtained\\nafter considerable practise.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThese exercises of the chromatic sense lead, in the case of the older\\nchildren, to the development of the \"color memory.\" A child having\\nlooked carefully at a color, is then invited to look for its companion\\nin a mixed group of colors, without, of course, keeping the color he\\nhas observed under his eye to guide him. It is, therefore, by his\\nmemory that he recognizes the color, which he no longer compares with\\na reality but with an image impressed upon his mind.\\n\\nThe children are very fond of this exercise in \"color memory\"; it\\nmakes a lively digression for them, as they run with the image of a\\ncolor in their minds and look for its corresponding reality in their\\nsurroundings. It is a real triumph for them to identify the idea with\\nthe corresponding reality and to _hold in their hands_ the proof of\\nthe mental power they have acquired.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAnother interesting piece of material is a little cabinet containing\\nsix drawers placed one above another. When they are opened they\\ndisplay six square wooden \"frames\" in each. (Fig. 16.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--CABINET WITH DRAWERS TO HOLD GEOMETRICAL INSETS.]\\n\\nAlmost all the frames have a large geometrical figure inserted in the\\ncenter, each colored blue and provided with a small button for a\\nhandle. Each drawer is lined with blue paper, and when the geometrical\\nfigure is removed, the bottom is seen to reproduce exactly the same\\nform.\\n\\nThe geometrical figures are arranged in the drawers according to\\nanalogy of form.\\n\\n(1) In one drawer there are six circles decreasing in diameter. (Fig.\\n17.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--SET OF SIX CIRCLES.]\\n\\n(2) In another there is a square, together with five rectangles in\\nwhich the length is always equal to the side of the square while the\\nbreadth gradually decreases. (Fig. 18.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--SET OF SIX RECTANGLES.]\\n\\n(3) Another drawer contains six triangles, which vary either according\\nto their sides or according to their angles (the equilateral,\\nisosceles, scalene, right angled, obtuse angled, and acute angled).\\n(Fig. 19.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--SET OF SIX TRIANGLES.]\\n\\n(4) In another drawer there are six regular polygons containing from\\nfive to ten sides, _i.e._, the pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon,\\nnonagon, and decagon. (Fig. 20.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--SET OF SIX POLYGONS.]\\n\\n(5) Another drawer contains various figures: an oval, an ellipse, a\\nrhombus, and a trapezoid. (Fig. 21.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--SET OF SIX IRREGULAR FIGURES.]\\n\\n(6) Finally, there are four plain wooden tablets, _i.e._, without any\\ngeometrical inset, which should have no button fixed to them; also two\\nother irregular geometrical figures. (Fig. 22.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--SET OF FOUR BLANKS AND TWO IRREGULAR FIGURES.]\\n\\nConnected with this material there is a wooden frame furnished with a\\nkind of rack which opens like a lid, and serves, when shut, to keep\\nfirmly in place six of the insets which may be arranged on the bottom\\nof the frame itself, entirely covering it. (Fig. 23.)\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--FRAME TO HOLD GEOMETRICAL INSETS.]\\n\\nThis frame is used for the preparation of the _first presentation_ to\\nthe child of the plane geometrical forms.\\n\\nThe teacher may select according to her own judgment certain forms\\nfrom among the whole series at her disposal.\\n\\nAt first it is advisable to show the child only a few figures which\\ndiffer very widely from one another in form. The next step is to\\npresent a larger number of figures, and after this to present\\nconsecutively figures more and more similar in form.\\n\\nThe first figures to be arranged in the frame will be, for example,\\nthe circle and the equilateral triangle, or the circle, the triangle\\nand the square. The spaces which are left should be covered with the\\ntablets of plain wood. Gradually the frame is completely filled with\\nfigures; first, with very dissimilar figures, as, for example, a\\nsquare, a very narrow rectangle, a triangle, a circle, an ellipse and\\na hexagon, or with other figures in combination.\\n\\nAfterwards the teacher\\'s object will be to arrange figures similar to\\none another in the frame, as, for example, the set of six rectangles,\\nsix triangles, six circles, varying in size, etc.\\n\\nThis exercise resembles that of the cylinders. The insets are held by\\nthe buttons and taken from their places. They are then mixed on the\\ntable and the child is invited to put them back in their places. Here\\nalso the control of the error is in the _material_, for the figure\\ncannot be inserted perfectly except when it is put in its own place.\\nHence a series of \"experiments,\" of \"attempts\" which end in victory.\\nThe child is led to compare the various forms; to realize in a\\nconcrete way the differences between them when an inset wrongly placed\\nwill not go into the aperture. In this way he educates his eye to the\\n_recognition of forms_.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--CHILD TOUCHING THE INSETS. (MONTESSORI SCHOOL,\\nRUNTON.)]\\n\\nThe new movement of the hand which the child must coordinate is of\\nparticular importance. He is taught to _touch the outline of the\\ngeometrical figures_ with the soft tips of the index and middle finger\\nof the right hand, or of the left as well, if one believes in\\nambidexterity. (Fig. 24.) The child is made to touch the outline, not\\nonly of the _inset_, but also of the corresponding aperture, and, only\\nafter _having touched_ them, is he to put back the inset into its\\nplace.\\n\\nThe _recognition_ of the form is rendered much easier in this way.\\nChildren who evidently do not _recognize the identities of form_ by\\nthe eye and who make absurd attempts to place the most diverse figures\\none within the other, _do recognize_ the forms after having touched\\ntheir outlines, and arrange them very quickly in their right places.\\n\\nThe child\\'s hand during this exercise of touching the outlines of the\\ngeometrical figures has a concrete guide in the object. This is\\nespecially true when he touches the frames, for his two fingers have\\nonly to follow the edge of the frame, which acts as an obstacle and is\\na very clear guide. The teacher must always intervene at the start to\\nteach accurately this movement, which will have such an importance in\\nthe future. She must, therefore, show the child _how to touch_, not\\nonly by performing the movement herself slowly and clearly, but also\\nby guiding the child\\'s hand itself during his first attempts, so that\\nhe is sure to touch all the details--angles and sides. When his hand\\nhas learned to perform these movements with precision and accuracy, he\\nwill be _really_ capable of following the outline of a geometrical\\nfigure, and through many repetitions of the exercise he will come to\\ncoordinate the movement _necessary_ for the exact delineation of its\\nform.\\n\\nThis exercise could be called an indirect but very real preparation\\nfor drawing. It is certainly the preparation of the hand to _trace an\\nenclosed form_. The little hand which touches, feels, and knows how to\\nfollow a determined outline is preparing itself, without knowing it,\\nfor writing.\\n\\nThe children make a special point of touching the outlines of the\\nplane insets with accuracy. They themselves have invented the exercise\\nof blindfolding their eyes so as to recognize the forms by touch only,\\ntaking out and putting back the insets without seeing them.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--SERIES OF CARDS WITH GEOMETRICAL FORMS.]\\n\\nCorresponding to every form reproduced in the plane insets there are\\nthree white cards square in shape and of exactly the same size as the\\nwooden frames of the insets. These cards are kept in three special\\ncardboard boxes, almost cubic in form. (Fig. 25.)\\n\\nOn the cards are repeated, in three series, the same geometrical forms\\nas those of the plane insets. The same measurements of the figures\\nalso are exactly reproduced.\\n\\nIn the first series the forms are filled in, _i.e._, they are cut out\\nin blue paper and gummed on to the card; in the second series there is\\nonly an outline about half a centimeter in width, which is cut out in\\nthe same blue paper and gummed to the card; in the third series,\\nhowever, the geometrical figures are instead outlined only in black\\nink.\\n\\nBy the use of this second piece of the material, the exercise of the\\neye is gradually brought to perfection in the recognition of \"plane\\nforms.\" In fact, there is no longer the concrete control of error in\\nthe material as there was in the _wooden_ insets, but the child, by\\nhis eye alone, must judge of identities of form when, instead of\\n_fitting_ the wooden forms into their corresponding apertures, he\\nsimply _rests_ them on the cardboard figure.\\n\\nAgain, the refinement of the eye\\'s power of discrimination increases\\nevery time the child passes from one series of cards to the next, and\\nby the time that he has reached the third series, he can see the\\nrelation between a wooden object, which he holds in his hand, and an\\noutline drawing; that is, he can connect the concrete reality with an\\n_abstraction_. The _line_ now assumes in his eyes a very definite\\nmeaning; and he accustoms himself to recognize, to interpret and to\\njudge of forms contained by a simple outline.\\n\\nThe exercises are various; the children themselves invent them. Some\\nlove to spread out a number of the figures of the geometric insets\\nbefore their eyes, and then, taking a handful of the cards and mixing\\nthem like playing cards, deal them out as quickly as possible,\\nchoosing the figures corresponding to the pieces. Then as a test of\\ntheir choice, they place the wooden pieces upon the forms on the\\ncards. At this exercise they often cover whole tables, putting the\\nwooden figures above, and beneath each one in a vertical line, the\\nthree corresponding forms of the cardboard series.\\n\\nAnother game invented by the children consists in putting out and\\nmixing all the cards of the three series on two or three adjoining\\ntables. The child then takes a wooden geometrical form and places it,\\nas quickly as possible, on the corresponding cards which he has\\nrecognized at a glance among all the rest.\\n\\nFour or five children play this game together, and as soon as one of\\nthem has found, for example, the filled-in figure corresponding to the\\nwooden piece, and has placed the piece carefully and precisely upon\\nit, another child takes away the piece in order to place it on the\\nsame form in outline. The game is somewhat suggestive of chess.\\n\\nMany children, without any suggestion from any one, touch with the\\nfinger the outline of the figures in the three series of cards, doing\\nit with seriousness of purpose, interest and perseverance.\\n\\nWe teach the children to name all the forms of the plane insets.\\n\\nAt first I had intended to limit my teaching to the most important\\nnames, such as square, rectangle, circle. But the children wanted to\\nknow all the names, taking pleasure in learning even the most\\ndifficult, such as trapezium, and decagon. They also show great\\npleasure in listening to the exact pronunciation of new words and in\\ntheir repetition. Early childhood is, in fact, the age in which\\nlanguage is formed, and in which the sounds of a foreign language can\\nbe perfectly learned.\\n\\nWhen the child has had long practise with the plane insets, he begins\\nto make \"discoveries\" in his environment, recognizing forms, colors,\\nand qualities already known to him--a result which, in general,\\nfollows after all the sensory exercises. Then it is that a great\\nenthusiasm is aroused in him, and the world becomes for him a source\\nof pleasure. A little boy, walking one day alone on the roof terrace,\\nrepeated to himself with a thoughtful expression on his face, \"The sky\\nis blue! the sky is blue!\" Once a cardinal, an admirer of the children\\nof the school in Via Guisti, wished himself to bring them some\\nbiscuits and to enjoy the sight of a little greediness among the\\nchildren. When he had finished his distribution, instead of seeing the\\nchildren put the food hastily into their mouths, to his great surprise\\nhe heard them call out, \"A triangle! a circle! a rectangle!\" In fact,\\nthese biscuits were made in geometrical shapes.\\n\\nIn one of the people\\'s dwellings at Milan, a mother, preparing the\\ndinner in the kitchen, took from a packet a slice of bread and butter.\\nHer little four-year-old boy who was with her said, \"Rectangle.\" The\\nwoman going on with her work cut off a large corner of the slice of\\nbread, and the child cried out, \"Triangle.\" She put this bit into the\\nsaucepan, and the child, looking at the piece that was left, called\\nout more loudly than before, \"And now it is a trapezium.\"\\n\\nThe father, a working man, who was present, was much impressed with\\nthe incident. He went straight to look for the teacher and asked for\\nan explanation. Much moved, he said, \"If I had been educated in that\\nway I should not be now just an ordinary workman.\"\\n\\nIt was he who later on arranged for a demonstration to induce all the\\nworkmen of the dwellings to take an interest in the school. They ended\\nby presenting the teacher with a parchment they had painted\\nthemselves, and on it, between the pictures of little children, they\\nhad introduced every kind of geometrical form.\\n\\nAs regards the touching of objects for the realization of their form,\\nthere is an infinite field of discovery open to the child in his\\nenvironment. Children have been seen to stand opposite a beautiful\\npillar or a statue and, after having admired it, to close their eyes\\nin a state of beatitude and pass their hands many times over the\\nforms. One of our teachers met one day in a church two little brothers\\nfrom the school in Via Guisti. They were standing looking at the small\\ncolumns supporting the altar. Little by little the elder boy edged\\nnearer the columns and began to touch them, then, as if he desired his\\nlittle brother to share his pleasure, he drew him nearer and, taking\\nhis hand very gently, made him pass it round the smooth and beautiful\\nshape of the column. But a sacristan came up at that moment and sent\\naway \"those tiresome children who were touching everything.\"\\n\\nThe great pleasure which the children derive from the recognition of\\n_objects_ by touching their form corresponds in itself to a sensory\\nexercise.\\n\\nMany psychologists have spoken of the _stereognostic_ sense, that is,\\nthe capacity of recognizing forms by the movement of the muscles of\\nthe hand as it follows the outlines of solid objects. This sense does\\nnot consist only of the sense of touch, because the tactile sensation\\nis only that by which we perceive the differences in quality of\\nsurfaces, rough or smooth. Perception of form comes from the\\ncombination of two sensations, tactile and muscular, muscular\\nsensations being sensations of movement. What we call in the blind the\\n_tactile_ sense is in reality more often the stereognostic sense. That\\nis, they perceive by means of their hands the _form of bodies_.\\n\\nIt is the special muscular sensibility of the child from three to six\\nyears of age who is forming his own muscular activity which stimulates\\nhim to use the stereognostic sense. When the child spontaneously\\nblindfolds his eyes in order to recognize various objects, such as the\\nplane and solid insets, he is exercising this sense.\\n\\nThere are many exercises which he can do to enable him to recognize\\nwith closed eyes objects of well defined shapes, as, for example, the\\nlittle bricks and cubes of Froebel, marbles, coins, beans, peas, etc.\\nFrom a selection of different objects mixed together he can pick out\\nthose that are alike, and arrange them in separate heaps.\\n\\nIn the didactic material there are also geometrical solids--pale blue\\nin color--a sphere, a prism, a pyramid, a cone, a cylinder. The most\\nattractive way of teaching a child to recognize these forms is for him\\nto touch them with closed eyes and guess their names, the latter\\nlearned in a way which I will describe later. After an exercise of\\nthis kind the child when his eyes are open observes the forms with a\\nmuch more lively interest. Another way of interesting him in the solid\\ngeometrical forms is to make them _move_. The sphere rolls in every\\ndirection; the cylinder rolls in one direction only; the cone rolls\\nround itself; the prism and the pyramid, however, stand still, but the\\nprism falls over more easily than the pyramid.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--SOUND BOXES.]\\n\\nLittle more remains of the didactic material for the education of the\\nsenses. There is, however, a series of six cardboard cylinders, either\\nclosed entirely or with wooden covers. (Fig. 26.)\\n\\nWhen these cases are shaken they produce sounds varying in intensity\\nfrom loud to almost imperceptible sounds, according to the nature of\\nthe objects inside the cylinder.\\n\\nThere is a double act of these, and the exercise consists, first, in\\nthe recognition of sounds of equal intensity, arranging the cylinders\\nin pairs. The next exercise consists in the comparison of one sound\\nwith another; that is, the child arranges the six cylinders in a\\nseries according to the loudness of sound which they produce. The\\nexercise is analogous to that with the color spools, which also are\\npaired and then arranged in gradation. In this case also the child\\nperforms the exercise seated comfortably at a table. After a\\npreliminary explanation from the teacher he repeats the exercise by\\nhimself, his eyes being blindfolded that he may better concentrate his\\nattention.\\n\\nWe may conclude with a general rule for the direction of the education\\nof the senses. The order of procedure should be:\\n\\n(1) Recognition of _identities_ (the pairing of similar objects and\\nthe insertion of solid forms into places which fit them).\\n\\n(2) Recognition of _contrasts_ (the presentation of the extremes of a\\nseries of objects).\\n\\n(3) Discrimination between objects very _similar_ to one another.\\n\\nTo concentrate the attention of the child upon the sensory stimulus\\nwhich is acting upon him at a particular moment, it is well, as far as\\npossible, to _isolate_ the sense; for instance, to obtain silence in\\nthe room for all the exercises and to blindfold the eyes for those\\nparticular exercises which do not relate to the education of the sense\\nof sight.\\n\\nThe cinematograph pictures give a general idea of all the sense\\nexercises which the children can do with the material, and any one who\\nhas been initiated into the theory on which these are based will be\\nable gradually to recognize them as they are seen practically carried\\nout.\\n\\nIt is very advisable for those who wish to guide the children in these\\nsensory exercises to begin themselves by working with the didactic\\nmaterial. The experience will give them some idea of what the children\\nmust feel, of the difficulties which they must overcome, etc., and, up\\nto a certain point, it will give them some conception of the interest\\nwhich these exercises can arouse in them. Whoever makes such\\nexperiments himself will be most struck by the fact that, when\\nblindfolded, he finds that all the sensations of touch and hearing\\nreally appear more acute and more easily recognized. On account of\\nthis alone no small interest will be aroused in the experimenter.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFor the beginning of the education of the musical sense, we use in\\nRome a material which does not form part of the didactic apparatus as\\nit is sold at present. It consists of a double series of bells forming\\nan octave with tones and semitones. These metal bells, which stand\\nupon a wooden rectangular base, are all alike in appearance, but, when\\nstruck with a little wooden hammer, give out sounds corresponding to\\nthe notes doh, re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti, doh, doh [sharp], re\\n[sharp], fah [sharp], soh [sharp], lah [sharp].\\n\\n[Illustration: Musical Scale (Chromatic)]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--MUSICAL BELLS.]\\n\\nOne series of bells is arranged in chromatic order upon a long board,\\nupon which are painted rectangular spaces which are black and white\\nand of the same size as the bases which support the bells. As on a\\npianoforte keyboard, the white spaces correspond to the tones, and the\\nblack to the semitones. (Fig. 27.)\\n\\nAt first the only bells to be arranged upon the board are those which\\ncorrespond to the tones; these are set upon the white spaces in the\\norder of the musical notes, doh, re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti, doh.\\n\\nTo perform the first exercise the child strikes with a small hammer\\nthe first note of the series already arranged (doh). Then among a\\nsecond series of corresponding bells which, arranged without the\\nsemitones, are mixed together upon the table, he tries, by striking\\nthe bells one after the other, to find the sound which is the same as\\nthe first one he has struck (doh). When he has succeeded in finding\\nthe corresponding sound, he puts the bell thus chosen opposite the\\nfirst one (doh) upon the board. Then he strikes the second bell, _re_,\\nonce or twice; then from among the mixed group of bells he makes\\nexperiments until he recognizes _re_, which he places opposite the\\nsecond bell of the series already arranged. He continues in the same\\nway right to the end, looking for the identity of the sounds and\\nperforming an exercise of _pairing_ similar to that already done in\\nthe case of the sound-boxes, the colors, etc.\\n\\nLater, he learns in order the sounds of the musical scale, striking in\\nrapid succession the bells arranged in order, and also accompanying\\nhis action with his voice--doh, re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti, doh. When\\nhe is able to recognize and _remember_ the series of sounds, the child\\ntakes the eight bells and, after mixing them up, he tries by striking\\nthem with the hammer, to find _doh_, then _re_, etc. Every time that\\nhe takes a new note, he strikes from the beginning all the bells\\nalready recognized and arranged in order--doh, _re_, doh, re, _mi_;\\ndoh, re, mi, _fah_; doh, re, mi, fah, _soh_, etc. In this way he\\nsucceeds in arranging all the bells in the order of the scale, guided\\nonly by his ear, and having succeeded, he strikes all the notes one\\nafter the other up and down the scale. This exercise fascinates\\nchildren from five years old upwards.\\n\\nIf the objects which have been described constitute the didactic\\nmaterial for the beginnings of a methodical education of the auditory\\nsense, I have no desire to limit to them an educational process which\\nis so important and already so complex in its practise, whether in the\\nlong established methods of treatment for the deaf, or in modern\\nphysiological musical education. In fact, I also use resonant metal\\ntubes, small bars of wood which emit musical notes, and strings\\n(little harps), upon which the children seek to recognize the tones\\nthey have already learned with the exercise of the bells. The\\npianoforte may also be used for the same purpose. In this way the\\ndifference in _timbre_ comes to be perceived together with the\\ndifferences in tone. At the same time various exercises, already\\nmentioned, such as the marches played on the piano for rhythmic\\nexercises, and the simple songs sung by the children themselves, offer\\nextensive means for the development of the musical sense.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nTo quicken the child\\'s attention in special relation to sounds there\\nis a most important exercise which, contrary to all attempts made up\\nto this time in the practise of education, consists not in producing\\nbut in eliminating, as far as possible, all sounds from the\\nenvironment. My \"lesson of silence\" has been very widely applied, even\\nin schools where the rest of my method has not found its way, for the\\nsake of its practical effect upon the discipline of the children.\\n\\nThe children are taught \"not to move\"; to inhibit all those motor\\nimpulses which may arise from any cause whatsoever, and in order to\\ninduce in them real \"immobility,\" it is necessary to initiate them in\\nthe _control_ of all their movements. The teacher, then, does not\\nlimit herself to saying, \"Sit still,\" but she gives them the example\\nherself, showing them how to sit absolutely still; that is, with feet\\nstill, body still, arms still, head still. The respiratory movements\\nshould also be performed in such a way as to produce no sound.\\n\\nThe children must be taught how to succeed in this exercise. The\\nfundamental condition is that of finding a comfortable position,\\n_i.e._, a position of equilibrium. As they are seated for this\\nexercise, they must therefore make themselves comfortable either in\\ntheir little chairs or on the ground. When immobility is obtained, the\\nroom is half-darkened, or else the children close their eyes, or cover\\nthem with their hands.\\n\\nIt is quite plain to see that the children take a great interest in\\nthe \"Silence\"; they seem to give themselves up to a kind of spell:\\nthey might be said to be wrapped in meditation. Little by little, as\\neach child, watching himself, becomes more and more still, the silence\\ndeepens till it becomes absolute and can be felt, just as the\\ntwilight gradually deepens whilst the sun is setting.\\n\\nThen it is that slight sounds, unnoticed before, are heard; the\\nticking of the clock, the chirp of a sparrow in the garden, the flight\\nof a butterfly. The world becomes full of imperceptible sounds which\\ninvade that deep silence without disturbing it, just as the stars\\nshine out in the dark sky without banishing the darkness of the night.\\nIt is almost the discovery of a new world where there is rest. It is,\\nas it were, the twilight of the world of loud noises and of the uproar\\nthat oppresses the spirit. At such a time the spirit is set free and\\nopens out like the corolla of the convolvulus.\\n\\nAnd leaving metaphor for the reality of facts, can we not all recall\\nfeelings that have possessed us at sunset, when all the vivid\\nimpressions of the day, the brightness and clamor, are silenced? It is\\nnot that we miss the day, but that our spirit expands. It becomes more\\nsensitive to the inner play of emotions, strong and persistent, or\\nchangeful and serene.\\n\\n    \"It was that hour when mariners feel longing,\\n     And hearts grow tender.\"\\n\\n              (Dante, trans. Longfellow.)\\n\\nThe lesson of silence ends with a general calling of the children\\'s\\nnames. The teacher, or one of the children, takes her place behind the\\nclass or in an adjoining room, and \"calls\" the motionless children,\\none by one, by name; the call is made in a whisper, that is, without\\nvocal sound. This demands a close attention on the part of the child,\\nif he is to hear his name. When his name is called he must rise and\\nfind his way to the voice which called him; his movements must be\\nlight and vigilant, and so controlled _as to make no noise_.\\n\\nWhen the children have become acquainted with _silence_, their hearing\\nis in a manner refined for the perception of sounds. Those sounds\\nwhich are too loud become gradually displeasing to the ear of one who\\nhas known the pleasure of silence, and has discovered the world of\\ndelicate sounds. From this point the children gradually go on to\\nperfect themselves; they walk lightly, take care not to knock against\\nthe furniture, move their chairs without noise, and place things upon\\nthe table with great care. The result of this is seen in the grace of\\ncarriage and of movement, which is especially delightful on account of\\nthe way in which it has been brought about. It is not a grace taught\\nexternally for the sake of beauty or regard for the world, but one\\nwhich is born of the pleasure felt by the spirit in immobility and\\nsilence. The soul of the child wishes to free itself from the\\nirksomeness of sounds that are too loud, from obstacles to its peace\\nduring work. These children, with the grace of pages to a noble lord,\\nare serving their spirits.\\n\\nThis exercise develops very definitely the social spirit. No other\\nlesson, no other \"situation,\" could do the same. A profound silence\\ncan be obtained even when more than fifty children are crowded\\ntogether in a small space, provided that _all_ the children know how\\nto keep still and want to do it; but one disturber is enough to take\\naway the charm.\\n\\nHere is demonstration of the cooperation of all the members of a\\ncommunity to achieve a common end. The children gradually show\\nincreased power of _inhibition_; many of them, rather than disturb the\\nsilence, refrain from brushing a fly off the nose, or suppress a cough\\nor sneeze. The same exhibition of collective action is seen in the\\ncare with which the children move to avoid making a noise during their\\nwork. The lightness with which they run on tiptoe, the grace with\\nwhich they shut a cupboard, or lay an object on the table, these are\\nqualities that must be _acquired by all_, if the environment is to\\nbecome tranquil and free from disturbance. One rebel is sufficient to\\nmar this achievement; one noisy child, walking on his heels or banging\\nthe door, can disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the small community.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLANGUAGE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD\\n\\n\\nThe special importance of the sense of hearing comes from the fact\\nthat it is the sense organ connected with speech. Therefore, to train\\nthe child\\'s attention to follow sounds and noises which are produced\\nin the environment, to recognize them and to discriminate between\\nthem, is to prepare his attention to follow more accurately the sounds\\nof articulate language. The teacher must be careful to pronounce\\nclearly and completely the sounds of the word when she speaks to a\\nchild, even though she may be speaking in a low voice, almost as if\\ntelling him a secret. The children\\'s songs are also a good means for\\nobtaining exact pronunciation. The teacher, when she teaches them,\\npronounces slowly, separating the component sounds of the word\\npronounced.\\n\\nBut a special opportunity for training in clear and exact speech\\noccurs when the lessons are given in the nomenclature relating to the\\nsensory exercises. In every exercise, when the child has _recognized_\\nthe differences between the qualities of the objects, the teacher\\nfixes the idea of this quality with a word. Thus, when the child has\\nmany times built and rebuilt the tower of the pink cubes, at an\\nopportune moment the teacher draws near him, and taking the two\\nextreme cubes, the largest and the smallest, and showing them to him,\\nsays, \"This is large\"; \"This is small.\" The two words only, _large_\\nand _small_, are pronounced several times in succession with strong\\nemphasis and with a very clear pronunciation, \"This is _large_, large,\\nlarge\"; after which there is a moment\\'s pause. Then the teacher, to\\nsee if the child has understood, verifies with the following tests:\\n\"Give me the large one. Give me the _small_ one.\" Again, \"The large\\none.\" \"Now the small one.\" \"Give me the large one.\" Then there is\\nanother pause. Finally, the teacher, pointing to the objects in turn\\nasks, \"What is this?\" The child, if he has learned, replies rightly,\\n\"Large,\" \"Small.\" The teacher then urges the child to repeat the words\\nalways more clearly and as accurately as possible. \"What is it?\"\\n\"Large.\" \"What?\" \"Large.\" \"Tell me nicely, what is it?\" \"Large.\"\\n\\n_Large_ and _small_ objects are those which differ only in size and\\nnot in form; that is, all three dimensions change more or less\\nproportionally. We should say that a house is \"large\" and a hut is\\n\"small.\" When two pictures represent the same objects in different\\ndimensions one can be said to be an enlargement of the other.\\n\\nWhen, however, only the dimensions referring to the section of the\\nobject change, while the length remains the same, the objects are\\nrespectively \"thick\" and \"thin.\" We should say of two posts of equal\\nheight, but different cross-section, that one is \"thick\" and the other\\nis \"thin.\" The teacher, therefore, gives a lesson on the brown prisms\\nsimilar to that with the cubes in the three \"periods\" which I have\\ndescribed:\\n\\n_Period 1. Naming._ \"This is thick. This is thin.\"\\n\\n_Period 2. Recognition._ \"Give me the _thick_. Give me the _thin_.\"\\n\\n_Period 3. The Pronunciation of the Word._ \"What is this?\"\\n\\nThere is a way of helping the child to recognize differences in\\ndimension and to place the objects in correct gradation. After the\\nlesson which I have described, the teacher scatters the brown prisms,\\nfor instance, on a carpet, says to the child, \"Give me the thickest of\\nall,\" and lays the object on a table. Then, again, she invites the\\nchild to look for _the thickest_ piece among those scattered on the\\nfloor, and every time the piece chosen is laid in its order on the\\ntable next to the piece previously chosen. In this way the child\\naccustoms himself always to look either for the _thickest_ or the\\n_thinnest_ among the rest, and so has a guide to help him to lay the\\npieces in gradation.\\n\\nWhen there is one dimension only which varies, as in the case of the\\nrods, the objects are said to be \"long\" and \"short,\" the varying\\ndimension being length. When the varying dimension is height, the\\nobjects are said to be \"tall\" and \"short\"; when the breadth varies,\\nthey are \"broad\" and \"narrow.\"\\n\\nOf these three varieties we offer the child as a fundamental lesson\\nonly that in which the _length_ varies, and we teach the differences\\nby means of the usual \"three periods,\" and by asking him to select\\nfrom the pile at one time always the \"longest,\" at another always the\\n\"shortest.\"\\n\\nThe child in this way acquires great accuracy in the use of words. One\\nday the teacher had ruled the blackboard with very fine lines. A child\\nsaid, \"What small lines!\" \"They are not small,\" corrected another;\\n\"they are _thin_.\"\\n\\nWhen the names to be taught are those of colors or of forms, so that\\nit is not necessary to emphasize contrast between extremes, the\\nteacher can give more than two names at the same time, as, for\\ninstance, \"This is red.\" \"This is blue.\" \"This is yellow.\" Or, again,\\n\"This is a square.\" \"This is a triangle.\" \"This is a circle.\" In the\\ncase of a _gradation_, however, the teacher will select (if she is\\nteaching the colors) the two extremes \"dark\" and \"light,\" then making\\nchoice always of the \"darkest\" and the \"lightest.\"\\n\\nMany of the lessons here described can be seen in the cinematograph\\npictures; lessons on touching the plane insets and the surfaces, in\\nwalking on the line, in color memory, in the nomenclature relating to\\nthe cubes and the long rods, in the composition of words, reading,\\nwriting, etc.\\n\\nBy means of these lessons the child comes to know many words very\\nthoroughly--large, small; thick, thin; long, short; dark, light;\\nrough, smooth; heavy, light; hot, cold; and the names of many colors\\nand geometrical forms. Such words do not relate to any particular\\n_object_, but to a psychic acquisition on the part of the child. In\\nfact, the name is given _after a long exercise_, in which the child,\\nconcentrating his attention on different qualities of objects, has\\nmade comparisons, reasoned, and formed judgments, until he has\\nacquired a power of discrimination which he did not possess before. In\\na word, he has _refined his senses_; his observation of things has\\nbeen thorough and fundamental; he has _changed himself_.\\n\\nHe finds himself, therefore, facing the world with _psychic_ qualities\\nrefined and quickened. His powers of observation and of recognition\\nhave greatly increased. Further, the mental images which he has\\nsucceeded in establishing are not a confused medley; they are all\\nclassified--forms are distinct from dimensions, and dimensions are\\nclassed according to the qualities which result from the combinations\\nof varying dimensions.\\n\\nAll these are quite distinct from _gradations_. Colors are divided\\naccording to tint and to richness of tone, silence is distinct from\\nnon-silence, noises from sounds, and everything has its own exact and\\nappropriate name. The child then has not only developed in himself\\nspecial qualities of observation and of judgment, but the objects\\nwhich he observes may be said to go into their place, according to the\\norder established in his mind, and they are placed under their\\nappropriate name in an exact classification.\\n\\nDoes not the student of the experimental sciences prepare himself in\\nthe same way to observe the outside world? He may find himself like\\nthe uneducated man in the midst of the most diverse natural objects,\\nbut he differs from the uneducated man in that he has _special\\nqualities_ for observation. If he is a worker with the microscope, his\\neyes are trained to see in the range of the microscope certain minute\\ndetails which the ordinary man cannot distinguish. If he is an\\nastronomer, he will look through the same telescope as the curious\\nvisitor or _dilettante_, but he will see much more clearly. The same\\nplants surround the botanist and the ordinary wayfarer, but the\\nbotanist sees in every plant those qualities which are classified in\\nhis mind, and assigns to each plant its own place in the natural\\norders, giving it its exact name. It is this capacity for recognizing\\na plant in a complex order of classification which distinguishes the\\nbotanist from the ordinary gardener, and it is _exact_ and scientific\\nlanguage which characterizes the trained observer.\\n\\nNow, the scientist who has developed special qualities of observation\\nand who \"possesses\" an order in which to classify external objects\\nwill be the man to make scientific _discoveries_. It will never be he\\nwho, without preparation and order, wanders dreaming among plants or\\nbeneath the starlit sky.\\n\\nIn fact, our little ones have the impression of continually \"making\\ndiscoveries\" in the world about them; and in this they find the\\ngreatest joy. They take from the world a knowledge which is ordered\\nand inspires them with enthusiasm. Into their minds there enters \"the\\nCreation\" instead of \"the Chaos\"; and it seems that their souls find\\ntherein a divine exultation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFREEDOM\\n\\n\\nThe success of these results is closely connected with the delicate\\nintervention of the one who guides the children in their development.\\nIt is necessary for the teacher to _guide_ the child without letting\\nhim feel her presence too much, so that she may be always ready to\\nsupply the desired help, but may never be the obstacle between the\\nchild and his experience.\\n\\nA lesson in the ordinary use of the word cools the child\\'s enthusiasm\\nfor the knowledge of things, just as it would cool the enthusiasm of\\nadults. To keep alive that enthusiasm is the secret of real\\nguidance, and it will not prove a difficult task, provided that\\nthe attitude towards the child\\'s acts be that of respect, calm and\\nwaiting, and provided that he be left free in his movements and in\\nhis experiences.\\n\\nThen we shall notice that the child has a personality which he is\\nseeking to expand; he has initiative, he chooses his own work,\\npersists in it, changes it according to his inner needs; he does not\\nshirk effort, he rather goes in search of it, and with great joy\\novercomes obstacles within his capacity. He is sociable to the extent\\nof wanting to share with every one his successes, his discoveries, and\\nhis little triumphs. There is therefore no need of intervention. \"Wait\\nwhile observing.\" That is the motto for the educator.\\n\\nLet us wait, and be always ready to share in both the joys and the\\ndifficulties which the child experiences. He himself invites our\\nsympathy, and we should respond fully and gladly. Let us have endless\\npatience with his slow progress, and show enthusiasm and gladness at\\nhis successes. If we could say: \"We are respectful and courteous in\\nour dealings with children, we treat them as we should like to be\\ntreated ourselves,\" we should certainly have mastered a great\\neducational principle and undoubtedly be setting an _example of good\\neducation_.\\n\\nWhat we all desire for ourselves, namely, not to be disturbed in our\\nwork, not to find hindrances to our efforts, to have good friends\\nready to help us in times of need, to see them rejoice with us, to be\\non terms of equality with them, to be able to confide and trust in\\nthem--this is what we need for happy companionship. In the same way\\nchildren are human beings to whom respect is due, superior to us by\\nreason of their \"innocence\" and of the greater possibilities of their\\nfuture. What we desire they desire also.\\n\\nAs a rule, however, we do not respect our children. We try to force\\nthem to follow us without regard to their special needs. We are\\noverbearing with them, and above all, rude; and then we expect them to\\nbe submissive and well-behaved, knowing all the time how strong is\\ntheir instinct of imitation and how touching their faith in and\\nadmiration of us. They will imitate us in any case. Let us treat them,\\ntherefore, with all the kindness which we would wish to help to\\ndevelop in them. And by kindness is not meant caresses. Should we not\\ncall anyone who embraced us at the first time of meeting rude, vulgar\\nand ill-bred? Kindness consists in interpreting the wishes of others,\\nin conforming one\\'s self to them, and sacrificing, if need be, one\\'s\\nown desire. This is the kindness which we must show towards children.\\n\\nTo find the interpretation of children\\'s desires we must study them\\nscientifically, for their desires are often unconscious. They are the\\ninner cry of life, which wishes to unfold according to mysterious\\nlaws. We know very little of the way in which it unfolds. Certainly\\nthe child is growing into a man by force of a divine action similar to\\nthat by which from nothing he became a child.\\n\\nOur intervention in this marvelous process is _indirect_; we are here\\nto offer to this life, which came into the world by itself, the\\n_means_ necessary for its development, and having done that we must\\nawait this development with respect.\\n\\nLet us leave the life _free_ to develop within the limits of the good,\\nand let us observe this inner life developing. This is the whole of\\nour mission. Perhaps as we watch we shall be reminded of the words of\\nHim who was absolutely good, \"Suffer the little children to come unto\\nMe.\" That is to say, \"Do not hinder them from coming, since, if they\\nare left free and unhampered, they will come.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWRITING\\n\\n\\nThe child who has completed all the exercises above described, and is\\nthus _prepared_ for an advance towards unexpected conquests, is about\\nfour years old.\\n\\nHe is not an unknown quantity, as are children who have been left to\\ngain varied and casual experiences by themselves, and who therefore\\ndiffer in type and intellectual standard, not only according to their\\n\"natures,\" but especially according to the chances and opportunities\\nthey have found for their spontaneous inner formation.\\n\\nEducation has _determined an environment_ for the children. Individual\\ndifferences to be found in them can, therefore, be put down almost\\nexclusively to each one\\'s individual \"nature.\" Owing to their\\nenvironment which offers _means_ adapted and measured to meet the\\nneeds of their psychical development, our children have acquired a\\nfundamental type which is common to all. They have _coordinated_ their\\nmovements in various kinds of manual work about the house, and so have\\nacquired a characteristic independence of action, and initiative in\\nthe adaptation of their actions to their environment. Out of all this\\nemerges a _personality_, for the children have become little men, who\\nare self-reliant.\\n\\nThe special attention necessary to handle small fragile objects\\nwithout breaking them, and to move heavy articles without making a\\nnoise, has endowed the movements of the whole body with a lightness\\nand grace which are characteristic of our children. It is a deep\\nfeeling of responsibility which has brought them to such a pitch of\\nperfection. For instance, when they carry three or four tumblers at a\\ntime, or a tureen of hot soup, they know that they are responsible not\\nonly for the objects, but also for the success of the meal which at\\nthat moment they are directing. In the same way each child feels the\\nresponsibility of the \"silence,\" of the prevention of harsh sounds,\\nand he knows how to cooperate for the general good in keeping the\\nenvironment, not only orderly, but quiet and calm. Indeed, our\\nchildren have taken the road which leads them to mastery of\\nthemselves.\\n\\nBut their formation is due to a deeper psychological work still,\\narising from the education of the senses. In addition to ordering their\\nenvironment and ordering themselves in their outward personalities,\\nthey have also ordered the inner world of their minds.\\n\\nThe didactic material, in fact, does not offer to the child the\\n\"content\" of the mind, but the _order_ for that \"content.\" It causes\\nhim to distinguish identities from differences, extreme differences\\nfrom fine gradations, and to classify, under conceptions of quality\\nand of quantity, the most varying sensations appertaining to surfaces,\\ncolors, dimensions, forms and sounds. The mind has formed itself by a\\nspecial exercise of attention, observing, comparing, and classifying.\\n\\nThe mental attitude acquired by such an exercise leads the child to\\nmake ordered observations in his environment, observations which prove\\nas interesting to him as discoveries, and so stimulate him to multiply\\nthem indefinitely and to form in his mind a rich \"content\" of clear\\nideas.\\n\\nLanguage now comes to _fix_ by means of _exact words_ the ideas which\\nthe mind has acquired. These words are few in number and have\\nreference, not to separate objects, but rather to the _order of the\\nideas_ which have been formed in the mind. In this way the children\\nare able to \"find themselves,\" alike in the world of natural things\\nand in the world of objects and of words which surround them, for they\\nhave an inner guide which leads them to become _active and\\nintelligent explorers_ instead of wandering wayfarers in an unknown\\nland.\\n\\nThese are the children who, in a short space of time, sometimes in a\\nfew days, learn to write and to perform the first operations of\\narithmetic. It is not a fact that children in general can do it, as\\nmany have believed. It is not a case of giving my material for writing\\nto unprepared children and of awaiting the \"miracle.\"\\n\\nThe fact is that the minds and hands of our children are already\\n_prepared_ for writing, and ideas of quantity, of identity, of\\ndifferences, and of gradation, which form the bases of all calculation,\\nhave been maturing for a long time in them.\\n\\nOne might say that all their previous education is a preparation for\\nthe first stages of essential culture--_writing_, _reading_, _and\\nnumber_, and that knowledge comes as an easy, spontaneous, and logical\\nconsequence of the preparation--that it is in fact its natural\\n_conclusion_.\\n\\nWe have already seen that the purpose of the _word_ is to fix\\nideas and to facilitate the elementary comprehension of _things_.\\nIn the same way writing and arithmetic now fix the complex inner\\nacquisitions of the mind, which proceeds henceforward continually\\nto enrich itself by fresh observations.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOur children have long been preparing the hand for writing.\\nThroughout all the sensory exercises the hand, whilst cooperating\\nwith the mind in its attainments and in its work of formation, was\\npreparing its own future. When the hand learned to hold itself\\nlightly suspended over a horizontal surface in order to touch rough\\nand smooth, when it took the cylinders of the solid insets and\\nplaced them in their apertures, when with two fingers it touched the\\noutlines of the geometrical forms, it was coordinating movements,\\nand the child is now ready--almost impatient to use them in the\\nfascinating \"synthesis\" of writing.\\n\\nThe _direct_ preparation for writing also consists in exercises of the\\nmovements of the hand. There are two series of exercises, very\\ndifferent from one another. I have analyzed the movements which are\\nconnected with writing, and I prepare them separately one from the\\nother. When we write, we perform a movement for the _management_ of\\nthe instrument of writing, a movement which generally acquires an\\nindividual character, so that a person\\'s handwriting can be\\nrecognized, and, in certain medical cases, changes in the nervous\\nsystem can be traced by the corresponding alterations in the\\nhandwriting. In fact, it is from the handwriting that specialists in\\nthat subject would interpret the _moral character_ of individuals.\\n\\nWriting has, besides this, a general character, which has reference to\\nthe form of the alphabetical signs.\\n\\nWhen a man writes he combines these two parts, but they actually exist\\nas the _component parts of a single product_ and can be prepared\\napart.\\n\\n\\n_Exercises for the Management of the Instrument of Writing_\\n\\n(THE INDIVIDUAL PART)\\n\\nIn the didactic material there are two sloping wooden boards, on each\\nof which stand five square metal frames, colored pink. In each of\\nthese is inserted a blue geometrical figure similar to the geometrical\\ninsets and provided with a small button for a handle. With this\\nmaterial we use a box of ten colored pencils and a little book of\\ndesigns which I have prepared after five years\\' experience of\\nobserving the children. I have chosen and graduated the designs\\naccording to the use which the children made of them.\\n\\nThe two sloping boards are set side by side, and on them are placed\\nten complete \"insets,\" that is to say, the frames with the geometrical\\nfigures. (Fig. 28.) The child is given a sheet of white paper and the\\nbox of ten colored pencils. He will then choose one of the ten metal\\ninsets, which are arranged in an attractive line at a certain distance\\nfrom him. The child is taught the following process:\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--SLOPING BOARDS TO DISPLAY SET OF METAL INSETS.]\\n\\nHe lays the frame of the iron inset on the sheet of paper, and,\\nholding it down firmly with one hand, he follows with a colored pencil\\nthe interior outline which describes a geometrical figure. Then he\\nlifts the square frame, and finds drawn upon the paper an enclosed\\ngeometrical form, a triangle, a circle, a hexagon, etc. The child has\\nnot actually performed a new exercise, because he had already\\nperformed all these movements when he _touched_ the wooden plane\\ninsets. The only new feature of the exercise is that he follows the\\noutlines no longer directly with his finger, but through the medium\\nof a pencil. That is, he _draws, he leaves a trace_ of his movement.\\n\\nThe child finds this exercise easy and most interesting, and, as soon\\nas he has succeeded in making the first outline, he places above it\\nthe piece of blue metal corresponding to it. This is an exercise\\nexactly similar to that which he performed when he placed the wooden\\ngeometrical figures upon the cards of the third series, where the\\nfigures are only contained by a simple line.\\n\\nThis time, however, when the action of placing the form upon the\\noutline is performed, the child takes _another colored pencil_ and\\ndraws the outline of the blue metal figure.\\n\\nWhen he raises it, if the drawing is well done, he finds upon the\\npaper a geometrical figure contained by two outlines in colors, and,\\nif the colors have been well chosen, the result is very attractive,\\nand the child, who has already had a considerable education of the\\nchromatic sense is keenly interested in it.\\n\\nThese may seem unnecessary details, but, as a matter of fact, they are\\nall-important. For instance, if, instead of arranging the ten metal\\ninsets in a row, the teacher distributes them among the children\\nwithout thus exhibiting them, the child\\'s exercises are much limited.\\nWhen, on the other hand, the insets are exhibited before his eyes, he\\nfeels the desire to draw them _all_ one after the other, and the\\nnumber of exercises is increased.\\n\\nThe two _colored outlines_ rouse the desire of the child to see\\nanother combination of colors and then to repeat the experience. The\\nvariety of the objects and the colors are therefore an _inducement_ to\\nwork and hence to final success.\\n\\nHere the actual preparatory movement for writing begins. When the\\nchild has drawn the figure in double outline, he takes hold of a\\npencil \"like a pen for writing,\" and draws marks up and down until he\\nhas completely filled the figure. In this way a definite filled-in\\nfigure remains on the paper, similar to the figures on the cards of\\nthe first series. This figure can be in any of the ten colors. At\\nfirst the children fill in the figures very clumsily without regard\\nfor the outlines, making very heavy lines and not keeping them\\nparallel. Little by little, however, the drawings improve, in that\\nthey keep within the outlines, and the lines increase in number, grow\\nfiner, and are parallel to one another.\\n\\nWhen the child has begun these exercises, he is seized with a desire\\nto continue them, and he never tires of drawing the outlines of the\\nfigures and then filling them in. Each child suddenly becomes the\\npossessor of a considerable number of drawings, and he treasures them\\nup in his own little drawer. In this way he _organizes_ the movement\\nof writing, which brings him _to the management of the pen_. This\\nmovement in ordinary methods is represented by the wearisome pothook\\nconnected with the first laborious and tedious attempts at writing.\\n\\nThe organization of this movement, which began from the guidance of a\\npiece of metal, is as yet rough and imperfect, and the child now\\npasses on to the _filling in of the prepared designs_ in the little\\nalbum. The leaves are taken from the book one by one in the order of\\nprogression in which they are arranged, and the child fills in the\\nprepared designs with colored pencils in the same way as before. Here\\nthe choice of the colors is another intelligent occupation which\\nencourages the child to multiply the tasks. He chooses the colors by\\nhimself and with much taste. The delicacy of the shades which he\\nchooses and the harmony with which he arranges them in these designs\\nshow us that the common belief, that children love _bright and\\nglaring_ colors, has been the result of observation of _children\\nwithout education_, who have been abandoned to the rough and harsh\\nexperiences of an environment unfitted for them.\\n\\nThe education of the chromatic sense becomes at this point of a\\nchild\\'s development the _lever_ which enables him to become possessed\\nof a firm, bold and beautiful handwriting.\\n\\nThe drawings lend themselves to _limiting_, in very many ways, _the\\nlength of the strokes with which they are filled in_. The child will\\nhave to fill in geometrical figures, both large and small, of a\\npavement design, or flowers and leaves, or the various details of an\\nanimal or of a landscape. In this way the hand accustoms itself, not\\nonly to perform the general action, but also to confine the movement\\nwithin all kinds of limits.\\n\\nHence the child is preparing himself to write in a handwriting\\n_either_ large or small. Indeed, later on he will write as well\\nbetween the wide lines on a blackboard as between the narrow, closely\\nruled lines of an exercise book, generally used by much older\\nchildren.\\n\\nThe number of exercises which the child performs with the drawings is\\npractically unlimited. He will often take another colored pencil and\\ndraw over again the outlines of the figure already filled in with\\ncolor. A help to the _continuation_ of the exercise is to be found in\\nthe further education of the chromatic sense, which the child acquires\\nby painting the same designs in water-colors. Later he mixes colors\\nfor himself until he can imitate the colors of nature, or create the\\ndelicate tints which his own imagination desires. It is not possible,\\nhowever, to speak of all this in detail within the limits of this\\nsmall work.\\n\\n\\n_Exercises for the Writing of Alphabetical Signs_\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--SINGLE SANDPAPER LETTER.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--GROUPS OF SANDPAPER LETTERS.]\\n\\nIn the didactic material there are series of boxes which contain the\\nalphabetical signs. At this point we take those cards which are\\ncovered with very smooth paper, to which is gummed a letter of the\\nalphabet cut out in sandpaper. (Fig. 29.) There are also large cards\\non which are gummed several letters, grouped together according to\\nanalogy of form. (Fig. 30.)\\n\\nThe children \"have to _touch_ over the alphabetical signs as though\\nthey were writing.\" They touch them with the tips of the index and\\nmiddle fingers in the same way as when they touched the wooden insets,\\nand with the hand raised as when they lightly touched the rough and\\nsmooth surfaces. The teacher herself touches the letters to show the\\nchild how the movement should be performed, and the child, if he has\\nhad much practise in touching the wooden insets, _imitates_ her with\\n_ease_ and pleasure. Without the previous practise, however, the\\nchild\\'s hand does not follow the letter with accuracy, and it is most\\ninteresting to make close observations of the children in order to\\nunderstand the importance of a _remote motor preparation_ for writing,\\nand also to realize the _immense_ strain which we impose upon the\\nchildren when we set them to write directly without a previous motor\\neducation of the hand.\\n\\nThe child finds great pleasure in touching the sandpaper letters. It\\nis an exercise by which he applies to a new attainment the power he\\nhas already acquired through exercising the sense of touch. Whilst\\nthe child touches a letter, the teacher pronounces its sound, and she\\nuses for the lesson the usual three periods. Thus, for example,\\npresenting the two vowels _i_, _o_, she will have the child touch them\\nslowly and accurately, and repeat their relative sounds one after\\nthe other as the child touches them, \"i, i, i! o, o, o!\" Then she\\nwill say to the child: \"Give me i!\" \"Give me o!\" Finally, she will ask\\nthe question: \"What is this?\" To which the child replies, \"i, o.\"\\nShe proceeds in the same way through all the other letters, giving,\\nin the case of the consonants, not the name, but only the sound. The\\nchild then touches the letters by himself over and over again,\\neither on the separate cards or on the large cards on which several\\nletters are gummed, and in this way he establishes the movements\\nnecessary for tracing the alphabetical signs. At the same time he\\nretains the _visual_ image of the letter. This process forms the first\\npreparation, not only for writing, but also for reading, because it\\nis evident that when the child _touches_ the letters he performs the\\nmovement corresponding to the writing of them, and, at the same\\ntime, when he recognizes them by sight he is reading the alphabet.\\n\\nThe child has thus prepared, in effect, all the necessary movements\\nfor writing; therefore he _can write_. This important conquest is the\\nresult of a long period of inner formation of which the child is not\\nclearly aware. But a day will come--very soon--when he _will write_,\\nand that will be a day of great surprise for him--the wonderful\\nharvest of an unknown sowing.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--BOX OF MOVABLE LETTERS.]\\n\\nThe alphabet of movable letters cut out in pink and blue cardboard,\\nand kept in a special box with compartments, serves \"for the\\ncomposition of words.\" (Fig. 31.)\\n\\nIn a phonetic language, like Italian, it is enough to pronounce\\nclearly the different component sounds of a word (as, for example,\\nm-a-n-o), so that the child whose ear is _already educated_ may\\nrecognize one by one the component sounds. Then he looks in the\\nmovable alphabet for the _signs_ corresponding to each separate sound,\\nand lays them one beside the other, thus composing the word (for\\ninstance, mano). Gradually he will become able to do the same thing\\nwith words of which he thinks himself; he succeeds in breaking them up\\ninto their component sounds, and in translating them into a row of\\nsigns.\\n\\nWhen the child has composed the words in this way, he knows how to\\nread them. In this method, therefore, all the processes leading to\\nwriting include reading as well.\\n\\nIf the language is not phonetic, the teacher can compose separate\\nwords with the movable alphabet, and then pronounce them, letting the\\nchild repeat by himself the exercise of arranging and rereading them.\\n\\nIn the material there are two movable alphabets. One of them consists\\nof larger letters, and is divided into two boxes, each of which\\ncontains the vowels. This is used for the first exercises, in which\\nthe child needs very large objects in order to recognize the letters.\\nWhen he is acquainted with one half of the consonants he can begin to\\ncompose words, even though he is dealing with one part only of the\\nalphabet.\\n\\nThe other movable alphabet has smaller letters and is contained in a\\nsingle box. It is given to children who have made their first attempts\\nat composition with words, and already know the complete alphabet.\\n\\nIt is after these exercises with the movable alphabet that the child\\n_is able to write entire words_. This phenomenon generally occurs\\nunexpectedly, and then a child who has never yet traced a stroke or a\\nletter on paper _writes several words in succession_. From that moment\\nhe continues to write, always gradually perfecting himself. This\\nspontaneous writing takes on the characteristics of a _natural_\\nphenomenon, and the child who has begun to write the \"first word\" will\\ncontinue to write in the same way as he spoke after pronouncing the\\nfirst word, and as he walked after having taken the first step. The\\nsame course of inner formation through which the phenomenon of writing\\nappeared is the course of his future progress, of his growth to\\nperfection. The child prepared in this way has entered upon a course\\nof development through which he will pass as surely as the growth of\\nthe body and the development of the natural functions have passed\\nthrough their course of development when life has once been\\nestablished.\\n\\nFor the interesting and very complex phenomena relating to the\\ndevelopment of writing and then of reading, see my larger works.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE READING OF MUSIC\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--THE MUSICAL STAFF.[A]]\\n\\n-----\\n\\n  [A] The single staff is used in the Conservatoire of Milan and\\n      utilized in the Perlasca method.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWhen the child knows how to read, he can make a first application of\\nthis knowledge to the reading of the names of musical notes.\\n\\nIn connection with the material for sensory education, consisting of\\nthe series of bells, we use a didactic material, which serves as an\\nintroduction to musical reading. For this purpose we have, in the\\nfirst place, a wooden board, not very long, and painted pale green. On\\nthis board the staff is cut out in black, and in every line and space\\nare cut round holes, inside each of which is written the name of the\\nnote in its reference to the treble clef.\\n\\nThere is also a series of little white discs which can be fitted into\\nthe holes. On one side of each disc is written the name of the note\\n(doh, re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti, doh).\\n\\nThe child, guided by the name written on the discs, puts them, with\\nthe name uppermost, in their right places on the board and then reads\\nthe names of the notes. This exercise he can do by himself, and he\\nlearns the position of each note on the staff. Another exercise which\\nthe child can do at the same time is to place the disc bearing the\\nname of the note on the rectangular base of the corresponding bell,\\nwhose sound he has already learned to recognize by ear in the\\nsensorial exercise described above.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--DUMB KEYBOARD.]\\n\\nFollowing this exercise there is another staff made on a board of\\ngreen wood, which is longer than the other and has neither indentures\\nnor signs. A considerable number of discs, on one side of which are\\nwritten the names of the notes, is at the disposal of the child. He\\ntakes up a disc at random, reads its name and places it on the staff,\\nwith the name underneath, so that the white face of the disc shows on\\nthe top. By the repetition of this exercise the child is enabled to\\narrange many discs on the same line or in the same space. When he has\\nfinished, he turns them all over so that the names are outside, and so\\nfinds out if he has made mistakes. After learning the treble clef the\\nchild passes on to learn the bass with great ease.\\n\\nTo the staff described above can be added another similar to it,\\narranged as is shown in the figure. (Fig. 32.) The child beginning\\nwith doh, lays the discs on the board in ascending order in their\\nright position until the octave is reached: doh, re, mi, fah, soh,\\nlah, ti, doh. Then he descends the scale in the same way, returning to\\n_doh_, but continuing to place the discs always to the right: soh,\\nfah, mi, re, doh. In this way he forms an angle. At this point he\\ndescends again to the lower staff, ti, lah, soh, fah, mi, re, doh,\\nthen he ascends again on the other side: re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti,\\nand by forming with his two lines of discs another angle in the bass,\\nhe has completed a rhombus, \"the rhombus of the notes.\"\\n\\nAfter the discs have been arranged in this way, the upper staff is\\nseparated from the lower. In the lower the notes are arranged\\naccording to the bass clef. In this way the first elements of musical\\nreading are presented to the child, reading which corresponds to\\n_sounds_ with which the child\\'s ear is already acquainted.\\n\\nFor a first practical application of this knowledge we have used in\\nour schools a miniature pianoforte keyboard, which reproduces the\\nessentials of this instrument, although in a simplified form, and so\\nthat they are visible. Two octaves only are reproduced, and the keys,\\nwhich are small, are proportioned to the hand of a little child of\\nfour or five years, as the keys of the common piano are proportioned\\nto those of the adult. All the mechanism of the key is visible. (Fig.\\n39.) On striking a key one sees the hammer rise, on which is written\\nthe name of the note. The hammers are black and white, like the\\nnotes.\\n\\nWith this instrument it is very easy for the child to practise alone,\\nfinding the notes on the keyboard corresponding to some bar of written\\nmusic, and following the movements of the fingers made in playing the\\npiano.\\n\\nThe keyboard in itself is mute, but a series of resonant tubes,\\nresembling a set of organ-pipes, can be applied to the upper surface,\\nso that the hammers striking these produce musical notes corresponding\\nto the keys struck. The child can then pursue his exercises with the\\ncontrol of the musical sounds.\\n\\n\\nDIDACTIC MATERIAL FOR MUSICAL READING.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.\\n\\nOn the wooden board, round spaces are cut out\\ncorresponding to the notes. Inside each of the spaces there is a figure.\\nOn one side of each of the discs is written a number and on the other the\\nname of the note. They are fitted by the child into the corresponding\\nplaces.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.\\n\\nThe child next arranged the discs in the notes cut out on\\nthe staff, but there are no longer numbers written to help him find the\\nplaces. Instead, he must try to remember the place of the note on the\\nstaff. If he is not sure he consults the numbered board (Fig. 33).]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.\\n\\nThe child arranged on the staff the semitones in the\\nspaces which remain where the discs are far apart: do-re, re-mi, fah-soh,\\nsoh-la, la-ti. The discs for the semitones have the sharp on one side and\\nthe flat on the other, e.g., re[sharp]-mi[flat] are written on the\\nopposite sides of the same disc.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.\\n\\nThe children take a large number of discs and arrange them\\non the staff, leaving uppermost the side which is blank, i.e., the side\\non which the name of the note is not written. Then they verify their work\\nby turning the discs over and reading the name.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.\\n\\nThe double staff is formed by putting the two staves\\ntogether. The children arrange the notes in the form of a rhombus.]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.\\n\\nThe two boards are then separated and the notes remain\\narranged according to the treble and bass clefs. The corresponding key\\nsignatures are then placed upon the two different staves.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARITHMETIC\\n\\n\\nThe children possess all the instinctive knowledge necessary as a\\npreparation for clear ideas on numeration. The idea of quantity was\\ninherent in all the material for the education of the senses: longer,\\nshorter, darker, lighter. The conception of identity and of difference\\nformed part of the actual technique of the education of the senses,\\nwhich began with the recognition of identical objects, and continued\\nwith the arrangement in gradation of similar objects. I will make a\\nspecial illustration of the first exercise with the solid insets,\\nwhich can be done even by a child of two and a half. When he makes a\\nmistake by putting a cylinder in a hole too large for it, and so\\nleaves _one_ cylinder without a place, he instinctively absorbs the\\nidea of the absence of _one_ from a continuous series. The child\\'s\\nmind is not prepared for number \"by certain preliminary ideas,\" given\\nin haste by the teacher, but has been prepared for it by a process of\\nformation, by a slow building up of itself.\\n\\nTo enter directly upon the teaching of arithmetic, we must turn to the\\nsame didactic material used for the education of the senses.\\n\\nLet us look at the three sets of material which are presented after\\nthe exercises with the solid insets, _i.e._, the material for teaching\\n_size_ (the pink cubes), _thickness_ (the brown prisms), and _length_\\n(the green rods). There is a definite relation between the ten pieces\\nof each series. In the material for length the shortest piece is a\\n_unit of measurement_ for all the rest; the second piece is double the\\nfirst, the third is three times the first, etc., and, whilst the scale\\nof length increases by ten centimeters for each piece, the other\\ndimensions remain constant (_i.e._, the rods all have the same\\nsection).\\n\\nThe pieces then stand in the same relation to one another as the\\nnatural series of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\\n\\nIn the second series, namely, that which shows _thickness_, whilst the\\nlength remains constant, the square section of the prisms varies. The\\nresult is that the sides of the square sections vary according to the\\nseries of natural numbers, _i.e._, in the first prism, the square of\\nthe section has sides of one centimeter, in the second of two\\ncentimeters, in the third of three centimeters, etc., and so on until\\nthe tenth, in which the square of the section has sides of ten\\ncentimeters. The prisms therefore are in the same proportion to one\\nanother as the numbers of the series of squares (1, 4, 9, etc.), for\\nit would take four prisms of the first size to make the second, nine\\nto make the third, etc. The pieces which make up the series for\\nteaching thickness are therefore in the following proportion: 1 : 4 :\\n9 : 16 : 25 : 36 : 49 : 64 : 81 : 100.\\n\\nIn the case of the pink cubes the edge increases according to the\\nnumerical series, _i.e._, the first cube has an edge of one\\ncentimeter, the second of two centimeters, the third of three\\ncentimeters, and so on, to the tenth cube, which has an edge of ten\\ncentimeters. Hence the relation in volume between them is that of the\\ncubes of the series of numbers from one to ten, _i.e._, 1 : 8: 27 :\\n64: 125 : 216 : 343 : 512 : 729 : 1000. In fact, to make up the\\nvolume of the second pink cube, eight of the first little cubes would\\nbe required; to make up the volume of the third, twenty-seven would be\\nrequired, and so on.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n   =====\\n   =====-----\\n   =====-----=====\\n A =====-----=====-----  B\\n   =====-----=====-----=====\\n   =====-----=====-----=====-----\\n   =====-----=====-----=====-----=====\\n   =====-----=====-----=====-----=====-----\\n   =====-----=====-----=====-----=====-----=====\\n   =====-----=====-----=====-----=====-----=====-----\\n     1\\n     1    2\\n     1    2    3\\n     1    2    3    4\\n     1    2    3    4    5\\n     1    2    3    4    5    6\\n     1    2    3    4    5    6    7\\n     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8\\n     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9\\n     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10\\n\\n  FIG. 40.--DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING USE OF NUMERICAL RODS.]\\n\\nThe children have an intuitive knowledge of this difference, for they\\nrealize that the exercise with the pink cubes is the _easiest_ of all\\nthree and that with the rods the most difficult. When we begin the\\ndirect teaching of number, we choose the long rods, modifying them,\\nhowever, by dividing them into ten spaces, each ten centimeters in\\nlength, colored alternately red and blue. For example, the rod which\\nis four times as long as the first is clearly seen to be composed of\\nfour equal lengths, red and blue; and similarly with all the rest.\\n\\nWhen the rods have been placed in order of gradation, we teach the\\nchild the numbers: one, two, three, etc., by touching the rods in\\nsuccession, from the first up to ten. Then, to help him to gain a\\nclear idea of number, we proceed to the recognition of separate rods\\nby means of the customary lesson in three periods.\\n\\nWe lay the three first rods in front of the child, and pointing to\\nthem or taking them in the hand in turn, in order to show them to him\\nwe say: \"This is _one_.\" \"This is _two_.\" \"This is _three_.\" We point\\nout with the finger the divisions in each rod, counting them so as to\\nmake sure, \"One, two: this is _two_.\" \"One, two, three: this is\\n_three_.\" Then we say to the child: \"Give me _two_.\" \"Give me _one_.\"\\n\"Give me _three_.\" Finally, pointing to a rod, we say, \"What is this?\"\\nThe child answers, \"Three,\" and we count together: \"One, two, three.\"\\n\\nIn the same way we teach all the other rods in their order, adding\\nalways one or two more according to the responsiveness of the child.\\n\\nThe importance of this didactic material is that it gives a clear idea\\nof _number_. For when a number is named it exists as an object, a\\nunity in itself. When we say that a man possesses a million, we mean\\nthat he has a _fortune_ which is worth so many units of measure of\\nvalues, and these units all belong to one person.\\n\\nSo, if we add 7 to 8 (7 + 8), we add a _number to a number_, and these\\nnumbers for a _definite_ reason represent in themselves groups of\\nhomogeneous units.\\n\\nAgain, when the child shows us the 9, he is handling a rod which is\\ninflexible--an object complete in itself, yet composed of _nine equal\\nparts_ which can be counted. And when he comes to add 8 to 2, he will\\nplace next to one another, two rods, two objects, one of which has\\neight equal lengths and the other two. When, on the other hand, in\\nordinary schools, to make the calculation easier, they present the\\nchild with different objects to count, such as beans, marbles, etc.,\\nand when, to take the case I have quoted (8 + 2), he takes a group of\\neight marbles and adds two more marbles to it, the natural impression\\nin his mind is not that he has added 8 to 2, but that he has added 1\\n+ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 to 1 + 1. The result is not so clear, and\\nthe child is required to make the effort of holding in his mind the\\nidea of a group of eight objects as _one united whole_, corresponding\\nto a single number, 8.\\n\\nThis effort often puts the child back, and delays his understanding of\\nnumber by months or even years.\\n\\nThe addition and subtraction of numbers under ten are made very much\\nsimpler by the use of the didactic material for teaching lengths. Let\\nthe child be presented with the attractive problem of arranging the\\npieces in such a way as to have a set of rods, all as long as the\\nlongest. He first arranges the rods in their right order (the long\\nstair); he then takes the last rod (1) and lays it next to the 9.\\nSimilarly, he takes the last rod but one (2) and lays it next to the\\n8, and so on up to the 5.\\n\\nThis very simple game represents the addition of numbers within the\\nten: 9 + 1, 8 + 2, 7 + 3, 6 + 4. Then, when he puts the rods back in\\ntheir places, he must first take away the 4 and put it back under the\\n5, and then take away in their turn the 3, the 2, the 1. By this\\naction he has put the rods back again in their right gradation, but\\nhe has also performed a series of arithmetical subtractions, 10 - 4,\\n10 - 3, 10 - 2, 10 - 1.\\n\\nThe teaching of the actual figures marks an advance from the rods to\\nthe process of counting with separate units. When the figures are\\nknown, they will serve the very purpose in the abstract which the rods\\nserve in the concrete; that is, they will stand for the _uniting into\\none whole_ of a certain number of separate units.\\n\\nThe _synthetic_ function of language and the wide field of work which\\nit opens out for the intelligence is _demonstrated_, we might say, by\\nthe function of the _figure_, which now can be substituted for the\\nconcrete rods.\\n\\nThe use of the actual rods only would limit arithmetic to the small\\noperations within the ten or numbers a little higher, and, in the\\nconstruction of the mind, these operations would advance very little\\nfarther than the limits of the first simple and elementary education\\nof the senses.\\n\\nThe figure, which is a word, a graphic sign, will permit of that\\nunlimited progress which the mathematical mind of man has been able to\\nmake in the course of its evolution.\\n\\nIn the material there is a box containing smooth cards, on which are\\ngummed the figures from one to nine, cut out in sandpaper. These are\\nanalogous to the cards on which are gummed the sandpaper letters of\\nthe alphabet. The method of teaching is always the same. The child is\\n_made to touch_ the figures in the direction in which they are\\nwritten, and to name them at the same time.\\n\\nIn this case he does more than when he learned the letters; he is\\nshown how to place each figure upon the corresponding rod. When all\\nthe figures have been learned in this way, one of the first exercises\\nwill be to place the number cards upon the rods arranged in gradation.\\nSo arranged, they form a succession of steps on which it is a pleasure\\nto place the cards, and the children remain for a long time repeating\\nthis intelligent game.\\n\\nAfter this exercise comes what we may call the \"emancipation\" of the\\nchild. He carried his own figures with him, and now _using them_ he\\nwill know how to group units together.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--COUNTING BOXES.]\\n\\nFor this purpose we have in the didactic material a series of wooden\\npegs, but in addition to these we give the children all sorts of small\\nobjects--sticks, tiny cubes, counters, etc.\\n\\nThe exercise will consist in placing opposite a figure the number of\\nobjects that it indicates. The child for this purpose can use the box\\nwhich is included in the material. (Fig. 41.) This box is divided into\\ncompartments, above each of which is printed a figure and the child\\nplaces in the compartment the corresponding number of pegs.\\n\\nAnother exercise is to lay all the figures on the table and place\\nbelow them the corresponding number of cubes, counters, etc.\\n\\nThis is only the first step, and it would be impossible here to speak\\nof the succeeding lessons in zero, in tens and in other arithmetical\\nprocesses--for the development of which my larger works must be\\nconsulted. The didactic material itself, however, can give some idea.\\nIn the box containing the pegs there is one compartment over which the\\n0 is printed. Inside this compartment \"nothing must be put,\" and then\\nwe begin with _one_.\\n\\nZero is nothing, but it is placed next to one to enable us to count\\nwhen we pass beyond 9--thus, 10.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--ARITHMETIC FRAME.]\\n\\nIf, instead of the piece 1, we were to take pieces as long as the rod\\n10, we could count 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90. In the didactic\\nmaterial there are frames containing cards on which are printed such\\nnumbers from 10 to 90. These numbers are fixed into a frame in such a\\nway that the figures 1 to 9 can be slipped in covering the zero. If\\nthe zero of 10 is covered by 1 the result is 11, if with 2 it becomes\\n12, and so on, until the last 9. Then we pass to the twenties (the\\nsecond ten), and so on, from ten to ten. (Fig. 42.)\\n\\nFor the beginning of this exercise with the cards marking the tens we\\ncan use the rods. As we begin with the first ten (10) in the frame, we\\ntake the rod 10. We then place the small rod 1 next to rod 10, and at\\nthe same time slip in the number 1, covering the zero of the 10. Then\\nwe take rod 1 and figure 1 away from the frame, and put in their place\\nrod 2 next to rod 10, and figure 2 over the zero in the frame, and so\\non, up to 9. To advance farther we should need to use two rods of 10\\nto make 20.\\n\\nThe children show much enthusiasm when learning these exercises, which\\ndemand from them two sets of activities, and give them in their work\\nclearness of idea.\\n\\n                  *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIn writing and arithmetic we have gathered the fruits of a laborious\\neducation which consisted in coordinating the movements and gaining a\\nfirst knowledge of the world. This culture comes as a natural\\nconsequence of man\\'s first efforts to put himself into intelligent\\ncommunication with the world.\\n\\nAll those early acquisitions which have brought order into the child\\'s\\nmind, would be wasted were they not firmly established by means of\\nwritten language and of figures. Thus established, however, these\\nexperiences open up an unlimited field for future education. What we\\nhave done, therefore, is to introduce the child to a higher level--the\\nlevel of culture--and he will now be able to pass on to a _school_,\\nbut not the school we know to-day, where, irrationally, we try to give\\nculture to minds not yet prepared or _educated to receive it_.\\n\\nTo preserve the health of their minds, which have been _exercised_ and\\nnot _fatigued_ by the order of the work, our children must have a new\\nkind of school for the acquisition of culture. My experiments in the\\ncontinuation of this method for older children are already far\\nadvanced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMORAL FACTORS\\n\\n\\nA brief description such as this, of the _means_ which are used in the\\n\"Children\\'s House,\" may perhaps give the reader the impression of a\\nlogical and convincing system of education. But the importance of my\\nmethod does not lie in the organization itself, but _in the effects\\nwhich it produces on the child_. It is the _child_ who proves the\\nvalue of this method by his spontaneous manifestations, which seem to\\nreveal the laws of man\\'s inner development.[B] Psychology will perhaps\\nfind in the \"Children\\'s Houses\" a laboratory which will bring more\\ntruths to light than thus hitherto recognized; for the essential\\nfactor in psychological research, especially in the field of\\npsychogenesis, the origin and development of the mind, must be the\\nestablishment of normal conditions for the free development of\\nthought.\\n\\n-----\\n\\n  [B] See the chapters on Discipline in my larger works.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nAs is well known, we leave the children _free_ in their work, and in\\nall actions which are not of a disturbing kind. That is, we\\n_eliminate_ disorder, which is \"bad,\" but allow to that which is\\norderly and \"good\" the most complete liberty of manifestation.\\n\\nThe results obtained are surprising, for the children have shown a\\nlove of work which no one suspected to be in them, and a calm and an\\norderliness in their movements which, surpassing the limits of\\ncorrectness have entered into those of \"grace.\" The spontaneous\\ndiscipline, and the obedience which is seen in the whole class,\\nconstitute the most striking result of our method.\\n\\nThe ancient philosophical discussion as to whether man is born good or\\nevil is often brought forward in connection with my method, and many\\nwho have supported it have done so on the ground that it provides a\\ndemonstration of man\\'s natural goodness. Very many others, on the\\ncontrary, have opposed it, considering that to leave children free is\\na dangerous mistake, since they have in them innate tendencies to\\nevil.\\n\\nI should like to put the question upon a more positive plane.\\n\\nIn the words \"good\" and \"evil\" we include the most varying ideas, and\\nwe confuse them especially _in our practical dealings with little\\nchildren_.\\n\\nThe tendencies which we stigmatize as _evil_ in little children of\\nthree to six years of age are often merely those which cause\\n_annoyance_ to us adults when, not understanding their needs, we try\\nto prevent their _every movement_, their every _attempt to gain\\nexperience for themselves in the world_ (by touching everything,\\netc.). The child, however, through this _natural tendency_, is led to\\n_coordinate his movements_ and to collect impressions, especially\\nsensations of touch, so that when prevented he _rebels_, and this\\nrebellion forms almost the whole of his \"naughtiness.\"\\n\\nWhat wonder is it that the evil disappears when, if we give the right\\n_means_ for development and leave full liberty to use them, rebellion\\nhas no more reason for existence?\\n\\nFurther, by the substitution of a series of outbursts of _joy_ for the\\nold series of outbursts of _rage_, the moral physiognomy of the child\\ncomes to assume a calm and gentleness which make him appear a\\ndifferent being.\\n\\nIt is we who provoked the children to the violent manifestations of a\\nreal _struggle for existence_. In order to exist _according to the\\nneeds of their psychic development_ they were often obliged to snatch\\nfrom us the things which seemed necessary to them for the purpose.\\nThey had to move contrary to our laws, or sometimes to struggle with\\nother children to wrest from them the objects of their desire.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if we give children the _means of existence_, the\\nstruggle for it disappears, and a vigorous expansion of life takes its\\nplace. This question involves a hygienic principle connected with the\\nnervous system during the difficult period when the brain is still\\nrapidly growing, and should be of great interest to specialists in\\nchildren\\'s diseases and nervous derangements. The inner life of man\\nand the beginnings of his intellect are controlled by special laws and\\nvital necessities which cannot be forgotten if we are aiming at health\\nfor mankind.\\n\\nFor this reason, an educational method, which cultivates and protects\\nthe inner activities of the child, is not a question which concerns\\nmerely the school or the teachers; it is a universal question which\\nconcerns the family, and is of vital interest to mothers.\\n\\nTo go more deeply into a question is often the only means of answering\\nit rightly. If, for instance, we were to see men fighting over a piece\\nof bread, we might say: \"How bad men are!\" If, on the other hand, we\\nentered a well-warmed eating-house, and saw them quietly finding a\\nplace and choosing their meal without any envy of one another, we\\nmight say: \"How good men are!\" Evidently, the question of absolute\\ngood and evil, intuitive ideas of which guide us in our superficial\\njudgment, goes beyond such limitations as these. We can, for instance,\\nprovide excellent eating-houses for an entire people without directly\\naffecting the question of their morals. One might say, indeed, that to\\njudge by appearances, a well-fed people are _better, quieter, and\\ncommit less crime_ than a nation that is ill-nourished; but whoever\\ndraws from that the conclusion that to make men good it is _enough_ to\\nfeed them, will be making an obvious mistake.\\n\\nIt cannot be denied, however, that _nourishment_ will be an essential\\nfactor in obtaining goodness, in the sense that it will _eliminate_\\nall the _evil acts, and the bitterness_ caused by lack of bread.\\n\\nNow, in our case, we are dealing with a far deeper need--the\\nnourishment of man\\'s inner life, and of his higher functions. The\\nbread that we are dealing with is the bread of the spirit, and we are\\nentering into the difficult subject of the satisfaction of man\\'s\\npsychic needs.\\n\\nWe have already obtained a most interesting result, in that we have\\nfound it possible to present _new means_ of enabling children to reach\\na higher level of calm and goodness, and we have been able to\\nestablish these means by experience. The whole foundation of our\\nresults rests upon these means which we have discovered, and which may\\nbe divided under two heads--the _organization of work_, and liberty.\\n\\nIt is the perfect organization of work, permitting the possibility of\\nself-development and giving outlet for the energies, which procures\\nfor each child the beneficial and calming _satisfaction_. And it is\\nunder such conditions of work that liberty leads to a perfecting of\\nthe activities, and to the attainment of a fine discipline which is in\\nitself the result of that new quality of _calmness_ that has been\\ndeveloped in the child.\\n\\nFreedom without organization of work would be useless. The child left\\n_free_ without means of work would go to waste, just as a new-born\\nbaby, if _left free_ without nourishment, would die of starvation.\\n_The organization of the work_, therefore, is the corner-stone of this\\nnew structure of goodness; but even that organization would be in vain\\nwithout the _liberty_ to make use of it, and without freedom for the\\nexpansion of all those energies which spring from the satisfaction of\\nthe child\\'s highest activities.\\n\\nHas not a similar phenomenon occurred also in the history of man? The\\nhistory of civilization is a history of successful attempts to\\norganize work and to obtain liberty. On the whole, man\\'s goodness has\\nalso increased, as is shown by his progress from barbarism to\\ncivilization, and it may be said that crime, the various forms of\\nwickedness, cruelty and violence have been gradually decreasing during\\nthis passage of time.\\n\\nThe _criminality_ of our times, as a matter of fact, has been compared\\nto a form of _barbarism_ surviving in the midst of civilized peoples.\\nIt is, therefore, through the better organization of work that society\\nwill probably attain to a further purification, and in the meanwhile\\nit seems unconsciously to be seeking the overthrow of the last\\nbarriers between itself and liberty.\\n\\nIf this is what we learn from society, how great should be the results\\namong little children from three to six years of age if the\\norganization of their work is complete, and their freedom absolute? It\\nis for this reason that to us they seem so good, like heralds of hope\\nand of redemption.\\n\\nIf men, walking as yet so painfully and imperfectly along the road of\\nwork and of freedom, have become better, why should we fear that the\\nsame road will prove disastrous to the children?\\n\\nYet, on the other hand, I would not say that the goodness of our\\nlittle ones in their freedom will solve the problem of the absolute\\ngoodness or wickedness of man. We can only say that we have made a\\ncontribution to the cause of goodness by removing obstacles which were\\nthe cause of violence and of rebellion.\\n\\nLet us \"render, therefore, unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar\\'s, and\\nunto God the things that are God\\'s.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\n\\n  Illustrations have been moved closer to their relevant paragraphs.\\n\\n  The page numbers in the List of Illustrations do not reflect the new\\n  placement of the illustrations, but are as in the original.\\n\\n  The list of \"didactic material for the _education of the senses_\" on\\n  pages 18-19 is missing item (j) as in the original.\\n\\n  Author\\'s archaic and variable spelling is preserved.\\n\\n  Author\\'s punctuation style is preserved.\\n\\n  Passages in italics indicated by _underscores_.\\n\\n  Passages in bold indicated by =equal signs=.\\n\\n  Typographical problems have been changed and are listed below.\\n\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Changes:\\n\\n  Page vii: Was \\'marvellous\\' [In fact, Helen Keller is a =marvelous=\\n           example of the phenomenon common to all human beings]\\n\\n  Page 46: Was \\'anvles\\' [which vary either according to their sides or\\n           according to their =angles= (the equilateral, isosceles,\\n           scalene, right angled, obtuse angled, and acute)]\\n\\n  Page 63: Added commas [recognized and arranged in order--doh, _re_,\\n           =doh,= re, _mi_; doh, =re,= mi, _fah_; doh, =re,= mi, fah,\\n           _soh_, etc. In this way he succeeds in arranging all the]\\n\\n  Fig. 35 caption: Was \\'si\\' [the spaces which remain where the discs\\n           are far apart: do-re, re-mi, fah-soh, soh-la, la-=ti=.

Appleton And Company\\nCopyright, 1906, 1916, by\\nD. Appleton and Company\\nPrinted in the United States of America\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION\\n\\n\\nAuthors, no doubt, are always gratified when their works find favorable\\nacceptance. The writer of this text has been doubly gratified, however,\\nat the cordial reception and widespread use accorded to the present\\nvolume. This feeling does not arise from any narrow personal pride or\\nselfish interest, but rather from the fact that the warm approval of the\\neducational public has proved an important point; namely, that the\\nfundamental truths of psychology, when put simply and concretely, can be\\nmade of interest and value to students of all ages from high school\\njuniors up, and to the general public as well. More encouraging still,\\nit has been demonstrated that the teachings of psychology can become\\nimmediately helpful, not only in study or teaching, but also in business\\nor profession, in the control and guidance of the personal life, and in\\nthe problems met in the routine of the day\\'s work or its play.\\n\\nIn effecting the present revision, the salient features of the original\\nedition have been kept. The truths presented are the most fundamental\\nand important in the field of psychology. Disputed theories and\\nunsettled opinions are excluded. The subject matter is made concrete and\\npractical by the use of many illustrations and through application to\\nreal problems. The style has been kept easy and familiar to facilitate\\nthe reading. In short, there has been, while seeking to improve the\\nvolume, a conscious purpose to omit none of the characteristics which\\nsecured acceptance for the former edition.\\n\\nOn the other hand, certain changes and additions have been made which,\\nit is believed, will add to the strength of the work. First of all, the\\nlater psychological studies and investigations have been drawn upon to\\ninsure that the matter shall at all points be abreast of the times in\\nscientific accuracy. Because of the wide use of the text in the training\\nof teachers, a more specific educational application to schoolroom\\nproblems has been made in various chapters. Exercises for the guidance\\nof observation work and personal introspection are freely used. The\\nchapter on Sensation and Perception has been separated into two\\nchapters, and each subject given more extensive treatment. A new chapter\\nhas been added on Association. The various chapters have been subdivided\\ninto numbered sections, and cut-in paragraph topics have been used to\\nfacilitate the study and teaching of the text. Minor changes and\\nadditions occur throughout the volume, thus adding some forty pages to\\nthe number in the original edition.\\n\\nMany of the modifications made in the revision are due to valuable\\nsuggestions and kindly criticisms received from many teachers of the\\ntext in various types of schools. To all who have thus helped so\\ngenerously by freely giving the author the fruits of their judgment and\\nexperience he gladly renders grateful thanks.\\n\\nCORNELL COLLEGE,\\n\\nIOWA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nTHE MIND, OR CONSCIOUSNESS                                            PAGE\\n\\n1.

It is easy to\\nunderstand how we may investigate the great world of material things\\nabout us; for we can see it, touch it, weigh it, or measure it. But how\\nare we to discover the nature of the mind, or come to know the processes\\nby which consciousness works? For mind is intangible; we cannot see it,\\nfeel it, taste it, or handle it. Mind belongs not to the realm of matter\\nwhich is known to the senses, but to the realm of _spirit_, which the\\nsenses can never grasp. And yet the mind can be known and studied as\\ntruly and as scientifically as can the world of matter. Let us first of\\nall see how this can be done.\\n\\n\\n1. HOW MIND IS TO BE KNOWN\\n\\nTHE PERSONAL CHARACTER OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--Mind can be observed and\\nknown. But each one can know directly only his own mind, and not\\nanother\\'s. You and I may look into each other\\'s face and there guess the\\nmeaning that lies back of the smile or frown or flash of the eye, and\\nso read something of the mind\\'s activity. But neither directly meets the\\nother\\'s mind. I may learn to recognize your features, know your voice,\\nrespond to the clasp of your hand; but the mind, the consciousness,\\nwhich does your thinking and feels your joys and sorrows, I can never\\nknow completely. Indeed I can never know your mind at all except through\\nyour bodily acts and expressions. Nor is there any way in which you can\\nreveal your mind, your spiritual self, to me except through these means.\\n\\nIt follows therefore that only _you_ can ever know _you_ and only _I_\\ncan ever know _I_ in any first-hand and immediate way. Between your\\nconsciousness and mine there exists a wide gap that cannot be bridged.\\nEach of us lives apart. We are like ships that pass and hail each other\\nin passing but do not touch. We may work together, live together, come\\nto love or hate each other, and yet our inmost selves forever stand\\nalone. They must live their own lives, think their own thoughts, and\\narrive at their own destiny.\\n\\nINTROSPECTION THE ONLY MEANS OF DISCOVERING NATURE OF\\nCONSCIOUSNESS.--What, then, is mind? What is the thing that we call\\nconsciousness? No mere definition can ever make it clearer than it is at\\nthis moment to each of us. The only way to know what mind is, is to look\\nin upon our own consciousness and observe what is transpiring there. In\\nthe language of the psychologist, we must _introspect_. For one can\\nnever come to understand the nature of mind and its laws of working by\\nlistening to lectures or reading text books alone. There is no\\n_psychology_ in the text, but only in your living, flowing stream of\\nthought and mine. True, the lecture and the book may tell us what to\\nlook for when we introspect, and how to understand what we find. But the\\nstatements and descriptions about our minds must be verified by our own\\nobservation and experience before they become vital truth to us.\\n\\nHOW WE INTROSPECT.--Introspection is something of an art; it has to be\\nlearned. Some master it easily, some with more difficulty, and some, it\\nis to be feared, never become skilled in its use. In order to introspect\\none must catch himself unawares, so to speak, in the very act of\\nthinking, remembering, deciding, loving, hating, and all the rest. These\\nfleeting phases of consciousness are ever on the wing; they never pause\\nin their restless flight and we must catch them as they go. This is not\\nso easy as it appears; for the moment we turn to look in upon the mind,\\nthat moment consciousness changes. The thing we meant to examine is\\ngone, and something else has taken its place. All that is left us then\\nis to view the mental object while it is still fresh in the memory, or\\nto catch it again when it returns.\\n\\nSTUDYING MENTAL STATES OF OTHERS THROUGH EXPRESSION.--Although I can\\nmeet only my own mind face to face, I am, nevertheless, under the\\nnecessity of judging your mental states and knowing what is taking place\\nin your consciousness. For in order to work successfully with you, in\\norder to teach you, understand you, control you or obey you, be your\\nfriend or enemy, or associate with you in any other way, I must _know_\\nyou. But the real you that I must know is hidden behind the physical\\nmask that we call the body. I must, therefore, be able to understand\\nyour states of consciousness as they are reflected in your bodily\\nexpressions. Your face, form, gesture, speech, the tone of voice,\\nlaughter and tears, the poise of attention, the droop of grief, the\\ntenseness of anger and start of fear,--all these tell the story of the\\nmental state that lies behind the senses. These various expressions are\\nthe pictures on the screen by which your mind reveals itself to others;\\nthey are the language by which the inner self speaks to the world\\nwithout.\\n\\nLEARNING TO INTERPRET EXPRESSION.--If I would understand the workings of\\nyour mind I must therefore learn to read the language of physical\\nexpression. I must study human nature and learn to observe others. I\\nmust apply the information found in the texts to an interpretation of\\nthose about me. This study of others may be _uncritical_, as in the mere\\nintelligent observation of those I meet; or it may be _scientific_, as\\nwhen I conduct carefully planned psychological experiments. But in\\neither case it consists in judging the inner states of consciousness by\\ntheir physical manifestations.\\n\\nThe three methods by which mind may be studied are, then: (1) text-book\\n_description and explanation_; (2) _introspection_ of my own conscious\\nprocesses; and (3) _observation_ of others, either uncritical or\\nscientific.\\n\\n\\n2. THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS\\n\\nINNER NATURE OF THE MIND NOT REVEALED BY INTROSPECTION.--We are not to\\nbe too greatly discouraged if, even by introspection, we cannot discover\\nexactly _what_ the mind is. No one knows what electricity is, though\\nnearly everyone uses it in one form or another. We study the dynamo, the\\nmotor, and the conductors through which electricity manifests itself. We\\nobserve its effects in light, heat, and mechanical power, and so learn\\nthe laws which govern its operations. But we are almost as far from\\nunderstanding its true nature as were the ancients who knew nothing of\\nits uses. The dynamo does not create the electricity, but only furnishes\\nthe conditions which make it possible for electricity to manifest\\nitself in doing the world\\'s work. Likewise the brain or nervous system\\ndoes not create the mind, but it furnishes the machine through which the\\nmind works. We may study the nervous system and learn something of the\\nconditions and limitations under which the mind operates, but this is\\nnot studying the mind itself. As in the case of electricity, what we\\nknow about the mind we must learn through the activities in which it\\nmanifests itself--these we can know, for they are in the experience of\\nall. It is, then, only by studying these processes of consciousness that\\nwe come to know the laws which govern the mind and its development.\\n_What_ it is that thinks and feels and wills in us is too hard a problem\\nfor us here--indeed, has been too hard a problem for the philosophers\\nthrough the ages. But the thinking and feeling and willing we can watch\\nas they occur, and hence come to know.\\n\\nCONSCIOUSNESS AS A PROCESS OR STREAM.--In looking in upon the mind we\\nmust expect to discover, then, not a _thing_, but a _process_. The\\n_thing_ forever eludes us, but the process is always present.\\nConsciousness is like a stream, which, so far as we are concerned with\\nit in a psychological discussion, has its rise at the cradle and its end\\nat the grave. It begins with the babe\\'s first faint gropings after light\\nin his new world as he enters it, and ends with the man\\'s last blind\\ngropings after light in his old world as he leaves it. The stream is\\nvery narrow at first, only as wide as the few sensations which come to\\nthe babe when it sees the light or hears the sound; it grows wider as\\nthe mind develops, and is at last measured by the grand sum total of\\nlife\\'s experience.\\n\\nThis mental stream is irresistible. No power outside of us can stop it\\nwhile life lasts. We cannot stop it ourselves. When we try to stop\\nthinking, the stream but changes its direction and flows on. While we\\nwake and while we sleep, while we are unconscious under an anæsthetic,\\neven, some sort of mental process continues. Sometimes the stream flows\\nslowly, and our thoughts lag--we \"feel slow\"; again the stream flows\\nfaster, and we are lively and our thoughts come with a rush; or a fever\\nseizes us and delirium comes on; then the stream runs wildly onward,\\ndefying our control, and a mad jargon of thoughts takes the place of our\\nusual orderly array. In different persons, also, the mental stream moves\\nat different rates, some minds being naturally slow-moving and some\\nnaturally quick in their operations.\\n\\nConsciousness resembles a stream also in other particulars. A stream is\\nan unbroken whole from its source to its mouth, and an observer\\nstationed at one point cannot see all of it at once. He sees but the one\\nlittle section which happens to be passing his station point at the\\ntime. The current may look much the same from moment to moment, but the\\ncomponent particles which constitute the stream are constantly changing.\\nSo it is with our thought. Its stream is continuous from birth till\\ndeath, but we cannot see any considerable portion of it at one time.\\nWhen we turn about quickly and look in upon our minds, we see but the\\nlittle present moment. That of a few seconds ago is gone and will never\\nreturn. The thought which occupied us a moment since can no more be\\nrecalled, just as it was, than can the particles composing a stream be\\nre-collected and made to pass a given point in its course in precisely\\nthe same order and relation to one another as before. This means, then,\\nthat we can never have precisely the same mental state twice; that the\\nthought of the moment cannot have the same associates that it had the\\nfirst time; that the thought of this moment will never be ours again;\\nthat all we can know of our minds at any one time is the part of the\\nprocess present in consciousness at that moment.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\\n\\nTHE WAVE IN THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--The surface of our mental\\nstream is not level, but is broken by a wave which stands above the\\nrest; which is but another way of saying that some one thing is always\\nmore prominent in our thought than the rest. Only when we are in a\\nsleepy reverie, or not thinking about much of anything, does the stream\\napproximate a level. At all other times some one object occupies the\\nhighest point in our thought, to the more or less complete exclusion of\\nother things which we might think about. A thousand and one objects are\\npossible to our thought at any moment, but all except one thing occupy a\\nsecondary place, or are not present to our consciousness at all. They\\nexist on the margin, or else are clear off the edge of consciousness,\\nwhile the one thing occupies the center. We may be reading a fascinating\\nbook late at night in a cold room. The charm of the writer, the beauty\\nof the heroine, or the bravery of the hero so occupies the mind that the\\nweary eyes and chattering teeth are unnoticed. Consciousness has piled\\nup in a high wave on the points of interest in the book, and the bodily\\nsensations are for the moment on a much lower level. But let the book\\ngrow dull for a moment, and the make-up of the stream changes in a\\nflash. Hero, heroine, or literary style no longer occupies the wave.\\nThey forfeit their place, the wave is taken by the bodily sensations,\\nand we are conscious of the smarting eyes and shivering body, while\\nthese in turn give way to the next object which occupies the wave. Figs.\\n1-3 illustrate these changes.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\\n\\nCONSCIOUSNESS LIKENED TO A FIELD.--The consciousness of any moment has\\nbeen less happily likened to a field, in the center of which there is an\\nelevation higher than the surrounding level. This center is where\\nconsciousness is piled up on the object which is for the moment foremost\\nin our thought. The other objects of our consciousness are on the margin\\nof the field for the time being, but any of them may the next moment\\nclaim the center and drive the former object to the margin, or it may\\ndrop entirely out of consciousness. This moment a noble resolve may\\noccupy the center of the field, while a troublesome tooth begets\\nsensations of discomfort which linger dimly on the outskirts of our\\nconsciousness; but a shooting pain from the tooth or a random thought\\ncrossing the mind, and lo! the tooth holds sway, and the resolve dimly\\nfades to the margin of our consciousness and is gone.\\n\\nTHE \"PILING UP\" OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS ATTENTION.--This figure is not so\\ntrue as the one which likens our mind to a stream with its ever onward\\ncurrent answering to the flow of our thought; but whichever figure we\\nemploy, the truth remains the same. Our mental energy is always piled up\\nhigher at one point than at others. Either because our interest leads\\nus, or because the will dictates, the mind is withdrawn from the\\nthousand and one things we might think about, and directed to this one\\nthing, which for the time occupies chief place. In other words, we\\n_attend_; for this piling up of consciousness is nothing, after all, but\\nattention.\\n\\n\\n3. CONTENT OF THE MENTAL STREAM\\n\\nWe have seen that our mental life may be likened to a stream flowing now\\nfaster, now slower, ever shifting, never ceasing. We have yet to inquire\\nwhat constitutes the material of the stream, or what is the stuff that\\nmakes up the current of our thought--what is the _content_ of\\nconsciousness? The question cannot be fully answered at this point, but\\na general notion can be gained which will be of service.\\n\\nWHY WE NEED MINDS.--Let us first of all ask what mind is for, why do\\nanimals, including men, have minds? The biologist would say, in order\\nthat they may _adapt_ themselves to their environment. Each individual\\nfrom mollusc to man needs the amount and type of mind that serves to\\nfit its possessor into its particular world of activity. Too little mind\\nleaves the animal helpless in the struggle for existence. On the other\\nhand a mind far above its possessor\\'s station would prove useless if not\\na handicap; a mollusc could not use the mind of a man.\\n\\nCONTENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS DETERMINED BY FUNCTION.--How much mind does man\\nneed? What range and type of consciousness will best serve to adjust us\\nto our world of opportunity and responsibility? First of all we must\\n_know_ our world, hence, our mind must be capable of gathering\\nknowledge. Second, we must be able to _feel_ its values and respond to\\nthe great motives for action arising from the emotions. Third, we must\\nhave the power to exert self-compulsion, which is to say that we possess\\na _will_ to control our acts. These three sets of processes, _knowing_,\\n_feeling_, and _willing_, we shall, therefore, expect to find making up\\nthe content of our mental stream.\\n\\nLet us proceed at once to test our conclusion by introspection. If we\\nare sitting at our study table puzzling over a difficult problem in\\ngeometry, _reasoning_ forms the wave in the stream of consciousness--the\\ncenter of the field. It is the chief thing in our thinking. The fringe\\nof our consciousness is made up of various sensations of the light from\\nthe lamp, the contact of our clothing, the sounds going on in the next\\nroom, some bit of memory seeking recognition, a \"tramp\" thought which\\ncomes along, and a dozen other experiences not strong enough to occupy\\nthe center of the field.\\n\\nBut instead of the study table and the problem, give us a bright\\nfireside, an easy-chair, and nothing to do. If we are aged,\\n_memories_--images from out the past--will probably come thronging in\\nand occupy the field to such extent that the fire burns low and the room\\ngrows cold, but still the forms from the past hold sway. If we are\\nyoung, visions of the future may crowd everything else to the margin of\\nthe field, while the \"castles in Spain\" occupy the center.\\n\\nOur memories may also be accompanied by emotions--sorrow, love, anger,\\nhate, envy, joy. And, indeed, these emotions may so completely occupy\\nthe field that the images themselves are for the time driven to the\\nmargin, and the mind is occupied with its sorrow, its love, or its joy.\\n\\nOnce more, instead of the problem or the memories or the \"castles in\\nSpain,\" give us the necessity of making some decision, great or small,\\nwhere contending motives are pulling us now in this direction, now in\\nthat, so that the question finally has to be settled by a supreme effort\\nsummed up in the words, _I will_. This is the struggle of the will which\\neach one knows for himself; for who has not had a raging battle of\\nmotives occupy the center of the field while all else, even the sense of\\ntime, place and existence, gave way in the face of this conflict! This\\nstruggle continues until the decision is made, when suddenly all the\\nstress and strain drop out and other objects may again have place in\\nconsciousness.\\n\\nTHE THREE FUNDAMENTAL PHASES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--Thus we see that if we\\ncould cut the stream of consciousness across as we might cut a stream of\\nwater from bank to bank with a huge knife, and then look at the cut-off\\nsection, we should find very different constituents in the stream at\\ndifferent times. We should at one time find the mind manifesting itself\\nin _perceiving_, _remembering_, _imagining_, _discriminating_,\\n_comparing_, _judging_, _reasoning_, or the acts by which we gain our\\nknowledge; at another in _fearing_, _loving_, _hating_, _sorrowing_,\\n_enjoying_, or the acts of feeling; at still another in _choosing_, or\\nthe act of the will. These processes would make up the stream, or, in\\nother words, these are the acts which the mind performs in doing its\\nwork. We should never find a time when the stream consists of but one of\\nthe processes, or when all these modes of mental activity are not\\nrepresented. They will be found in varying proportions, now more of\\nknowing, now of feeling, and now of willing, but some of each is always\\npresent in our consciousness. The nature of these different elements in\\nour mental stream, their relation to each other, and the manner in which\\nthey all work together in amazing perplexity yet in perfect harmony to\\nproduce the wonderful _mind_, will constitute the subject-matter we\\nshall consider together in the pages which follow.\\n\\n\\n4. WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS RESIDES\\n\\nI--the conscious self--dwell somewhere in this body, but where? When my\\nfinger tips touch the object I wish to examine, I seem to be in them.\\nWhen the brain grows weary from overstudy, I seem to be in it. When the\\nheart throbs, the breath comes quick, and the muscles grow tense from\\nnoble resolve or strong emotion, I seem to be in them all. When, filled\\nwith the buoyant life of vigorous youth, every fiber and nerve is\\na-tingle with health and enthusiasm, I live in every part of my\\nmarvelous body. Small wonder that the ancients located the soul at one\\ntime in the heart, at another in the pineal gland of the brain, and at\\nanother made it coextensive with the body!\\n\\nCONSCIOUSNESS WORKS THROUGH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.--Later science has\\ntaught that the _mind resides in and works through the nervous system,\\nwhich has its central office in the brain_. And the reason why _I_ seem\\nto be in every part of my body is because the nervous system extends to\\nevery part, carrying messages of sight or sound or touch to the brain,\\nand bearing in return orders for movements, which set the feet a-dancing\\nor the fingers a-tingling. But more of this later.\\n\\nThis partnership between mind and body is very close. Just how it\\nhappens that spirit may inhabit matter we may not know. But certain it\\nis that they interact on each other. What will hinder the growth of one\\nwill handicap the other, and what favors the development of either will\\nhelp both. The methods of their coöperation and the laws that govern\\ntheir relationship will develop as our study goes on.\\n\\n\\n5. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\nOne should always keep in mind that psychology is essentially a\\nlaboratory science, and not a text-book subject. The laboratory material\\nis to be found in ourselves and in those about us. While the text should\\nbe thoroughly mastered, its statements should always be verified by\\nreference to one\\'s own experience, and observation of others. Especially\\nshould prospective teachers constantly correlate the lessons of the book\\nwith the observation of children at work in the school. The problems\\nsuggested for observation and introspection will, if mastered, do much\\nto render practical and helpful the truths of psychology.\\n\\n1. Think of your home as you last left it. Can you see vividly just how\\nit looked, the color of the paint on the outside, with the familiar form\\nof the roof and all; can you recall the perfume in some old drawer, the\\ntaste of a favorite dish, the sound of a familiar voice in farewell?\\n\\n2. What illustrations have you observed where the mental content of the\\nmoment seemed chiefly _thinking_ (knowledge process); chiefly _emotion_\\n(feeling process); chiefly _choosing_, or self-compulsion (willing\\nprocess)?\\n\\n3. When you say that you remember a circumstance that occurred\\nyesterday, how do you remember it? That is, do you see in your mind\\nthings just as they were, and hear again sounds which occurred, or feel\\nagain movements which you performed? Do you experience once more the\\nemotions you then felt?\\n\\n4. What forms of expression most commonly reveal _thought_; what reveal\\nemotions? (i.e., can you tell what a child is _thinking about_ by the\\nexpression on his face? Can you tell whether he is _angry_,\\n_frightened_, _sorry_, by his face? Is speech as necessary in expressing\\nfeeling as in expressing thought?)\\n\\n5. Try occasionally during the next twenty-four hours to turn quickly\\nabout mentally and see whether you can observe your thinking, feeling,\\nor willing in the very act of taking place.\\n\\n6. What becomes of our mind or consciousness while we are asleep? How\\nare we able to wake up at a certain hour previously determined? Can a\\nperson have absolutely _nothing_ in his mind?\\n\\n7. Have you noticed any children especially adept in expression? Have\\nyou noticed any very backward? If so, in what form of expression in each\\ncase?\\n\\n8. Have you observed any instances of expression which you were at a\\nloss to interpret (remember that \"expression\" includes every form of\\nphysical action, voice, speech, face, form, hand, etc.)?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nATTENTION\\n\\n\\nHow do you rank in mental ability, and how effective are your mind\\'s\\ngrasp and power? The answer that must be given to these questions will\\ndepend not more on your native endowment than on your skill in using\\nattention.\\n\\n\\n1. NATURE OF ATTENTION\\n\\nIt is by attention that we gather and mass our mental energy upon the\\ncritical and important points in our thinking. In the last chapter we\\nsaw that consciousness is not distributed evenly over the whole field,\\nbut \"piled up,\" now on this object of thought, now on that, in obedience\\nto interest or necessity. _The concentration of the mind\\'s energy on one\\nobject of thought is attention._\\n\\nTHE NATURE OF ATTENTION.--Everyone knows what it is to attend. The story\\nso fascinating that we cannot leave it, the critical points in a game,\\nthe interesting sermon or lecture, the sparkling conversation--all these\\ncompel our attention. So completely is our mind\\'s energy centered on\\nthem and withdrawn from other things that we are scarcely aware of what\\nis going on about us.\\n\\nWe are also familiar with another kind of attention. For we all have\\nread the dull story, watched the slow game, listened to the lecture or\\nsermon that drags, and taken part in conversation that was a bore. We\\ngave these things our attention, but only with effort. Our mind\\'s energy\\nseemed to center on anything rather than the matter in hand. A thousand\\nobjects from outside enticed us away, and it required the frequent\\n\"mental jerk\" to bring us to the subject in hand. And when brought back\\nto our thought problem we felt the constant \"tug\" of mind to be free\\nagain.\\n\\nNORMAL CONSCIOUSNESS ALWAYS IN A STATE OF ATTENTION.--But this very\\neffort of the mind to free itself from one object of thought that it may\\nbusy itself with another is _because attention is solicited by this\\nother_. Some object in our field of consciousness is always exerting an\\nappeal for attention; and to attend _to_ one thing is always to attend\\n_away from_ a multitude of other things upon which the thought might\\nrest. We may therefore say that attention is constantly _selecting_ in\\nour stream of thought those aspects that are to receive emphasis and\\nconsideration. From moment to moment it determines the points at which\\nour mental energy shall be centered.\\n\\n\\n2. THE EFFECTS OF ATTENTION\\n\\nATTENTION MAKES ITS OBJECT CLEAR AND DEFINITE.--Whatever attention\\ncenters upon stands out sharp and clear in consciousness. Whether it be\\na bit of memory, an \"air-castle,\" a sensation from an aching tooth, the\\nreasoning on an algebraic formula, a choice which we are making, the\\nsetting of an emotion--whatever be the object to which we are attending,\\nthat object is illumined and made to stand out from its fellows as the\\none prominent thing in the mind\\'s eye while the attention rests on it.\\nIt is like the one building which the searchlight picks out among a city\\nfull of buildings and lights up, while the remainder are left in the\\nsemilight or in darkness.\\n\\nATTENTION MEASURES MENTAL EFFICIENCY.--In a state of attention the mind\\nmay be likened to the rays of the sun which have been passed through a\\nburning glass. You may let all the rays which can pass through your\\nwindow pane fall hour after hour upon the paper lying on your desk, and\\nno marked effects follow. But let the same amount of sunlight be passed\\nthrough a lens and converged to a point the size of your pencil point,\\nand the paper will at once burst into flame. What the diffused rays\\ncould not do in hours or in ages is now accomplished in seconds.\\nLikewise the mind, allowed to scatter over many objects, can accomplish\\nbut little. We may sit and dream away an hour or a day over a page or a\\nproblem without securing results. But let us call in our wits from their\\nwool-gathering and \"buckle down to it\" with all our might, withdrawing\\nour thoughts from everything else but this _one thing_, and\\nconcentrating our mind on it. More can now be accomplished in minutes\\nthan before in hours. Nay, _things which could not be accomplished at\\nall before_ now become possible.\\n\\nAgain, the mind may be compared to a steam engine which is constructed\\nto run at a certain pressure of steam, say one hundred and fifty pounds\\nto the square inch of boiler surface. Once I ran such an engine; and\\nwell I remember a morning during my early apprenticeship when the\\nforeman called for power to run some of the lighter machinery, while my\\nsteam gauge registered but seventy-five pounds. \"Surely,\" I thought, \"if\\none hundred and fifty pounds will run all this machinery, seventy-five\\npounds should run half of it,\" so I opened the valve. But the powerful\\nengine could do but little more than turn its own wheels, and refused\\nto do the required work. Not until the pressure had risen above one\\nhundred pounds could the engine perform half the work which it could at\\none hundred and fifty pounds. And so with our mind. If it is meant to do\\nits best work under a certain degree of concentration, it cannot in a\\ngiven time do half the work with half the attention. Further, there will\\nbe much _which it cannot do at all_ unless working under full pressure.\\nWe shall not be overstating the case if we say that as attention\\nincreases in arithmetical ratio, mental efficiency increases in\\ngeometrical ratio. It is in large measure a difference in the power of\\nattention which makes one man a master in thought and achievement and\\nanother his humble follower. One often hears it said that \"genius is but\\nthe power of sustained attention,\" and this statement possesses a large\\nelement of truth.\\n\\n\\n3. HOW WE ATTEND\\n\\nSomeone has said that if our attention is properly trained we should be\\nable \"to look at the point of a cambric needle for half an hour without\\nwinking.\" But this is a false idea of attention. The ability to look at\\nthe point of a cambric needle for half an hour might indicate a very\\nlaudable power of concentration; but the process, instead of\\nenlightening us concerning the point of the needle, would result in our\\npassing into a hypnotic state. Voluntary attention to any one object can\\nbe sustained for but a brief time--a few seconds at best. It is\\nessential that the object change, that we turn it over and over\\nincessantly, and consider its various aspects and relations. Sustained\\nvoluntary attention is thus a repetition of successive efforts to bring\\nback the object to the mind. Then the subject grows and develops--it is\\nliving, not dead.\\n\\nATTENTION A RELATING ACTIVITY.--When we are attending strongly to one\\nobject of thought it does not mean that consciousness sits staring\\nvacantly at this one object, but rather that it uses it as a central\\ncore of thought, and thinks into relation with this object the things\\nwhich belong with it. In working out some mathematical solution the\\ncentral core is the principle upon which the solution is based, and\\nconcentration in this case consists in thinking the various conditions\\nof the problem in relation to this underlying principle. In the\\naccompanying diagram (Fig. 4) let A be the central core of some object\\nof thought, say a patch of cloud in a picture, and let _a_, _b_, _c_,\\n_d_, etc., be the related facts, or the shape, size, color, etc., of the\\ncloud. The arrows indicate the passing of our thought from cloud to\\nrelated fact, or from related fact to cloud, and from related fact to\\nrelated fact. As long as these related facts lead back to the cloud each\\ntime, that long we are attending to the cloud and thinking about it. It\\nis when our thought fails to go back that we \"wander\" in our attention.\\nThen we leave _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, etc., which are related to the cloud,\\nand, flying off to _x_, _y_, and _z,_ finally bring up heaven knows\\nwhere.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\\n\\nTHE RHYTHMS OF ATTENTION.--Attention works in rhythms. This is to say\\nthat it never maintains a constant level of concentration for any\\nconsiderable length of time, but regularly ebbs and flows. The\\nexplanation of this rhythmic action would take us too far afield at this\\npoint. When we remember, however, that our entire organism works within\\na great system of rhythms--hunger, thirst, sleep, fatigue, and many\\nothers--it is easy to see that the same law may apply to attention. The\\nrhythms of attention vary greatly, the fluctuations often being only a\\nfew seconds apart for certain simple sensations, and probably a much\\ngreater distance apart for the more complex process of thinking. The\\nseeming variation in the sound of a distant waterfall, now loud and now\\nfaint, is caused by the rhythm of attention and easily allows us to\\nmeasure the rhythm for this particular sensation.\\n\\n\\n4. POINTS OF FAILURE IN ATTENTION\\n\\nLACK OF CONCENTRATION.--There are two chief types of inattention whose\\ndanger threatens every person. _First_, we may be thinking about the\\nright things, but not thinking _hard_ enough. We lack mental pressure.\\nOutside thoughts which have no relation to the subject in hand may not\\ntrouble us much, but we do not attack our problem with vim. The current\\nin our stream of consciousness is moving too slowly. We do not gather up\\nall our mental forces and mass them on the subject before us in a way\\nthat means victory. Our thoughts may be sufficiently focused, but they\\nfail to \"set fire.\" It is like focusing the sun\\'s rays while an eclipse\\nis on. They lack energy. They will not kindle the paper after they have\\npassed through the lens. This kind of attention means mental dawdling.\\nIt means inefficiency. For the individual it means defeat in life\\'s\\nbattles; for the nation it means mediocrity and stagnation.\\n\\nA college professor said to his faithful but poorly prepared class,\\n\"Judging from your worn and tired appearance, young people, you are\\nputting in twice too many hours on study.\" At this commendation the\\nclass brightened up visibly. \"But,\" he continued, \"judging from your\\npreparation, you do not study quite half hard enough.\"\\n\\nHappy is the student who, starting in on his lesson rested and fresh,\\ncan study with such concentration that an hour of steady application\\nwill leave him mentally exhausted and limp. That is one hour of triumph\\nfor him, no matter what else he may have accomplished or failed to\\naccomplish during the time. He can afford an occasional pause for rest,\\nfor difficulties will melt rapidly away before him. He possesses one key\\nto successful achievement.\\n\\nMENTAL WANDERING.--_Second_, we may have good mental power and be able\\nto think hard and efficiently on any one point, but lack the power to\\nthink in a straight line. Every stray thought that comes along is a\\n\"will-o\\'-the-wisp\" to lead us away from the subject in hand and into\\nlines of thought not relating to it. Who has not started in to think on\\nsome problem, and, after a few moments, been surprised to find himself\\nmiles away from the topic upon which he started! Or who has not read\\ndown a page and, turning to the next, found that he did not know a word\\non the preceding page, his thoughts having wandered away, his eyes only\\ngoing through the process of reading! Instead of sticking to the _a_,\\n_b_, _c_, _d_, etc., of our topic and relating them all up to A, thereby\\nreaching a solution of the problem, we often jump at once to _x_, _y_,\\n_z_, and find ourselves far afield with all possibility of a solution\\ngone. We may have brilliant thoughts about _x_, _y_, _z_, but they are\\nnot related to anything in particular, and so they pass from us and are\\ngone--lost in oblivion because they are not attached to something\\npermanent.\\n\\nSuch a thinker is at the mercy of circumstances, following blindly the\\nleadings of trains of thought which are his master instead of his\\nservant, and which lead him anywhere or nowhere without let or hindrance\\nfrom him. His consciousness moves rapidly enough and with enough force,\\nbut it is like a ship without a helm. Starting for the intellectual port\\n_A_ by way of _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, he is mentally shipwrecked at last on\\nthe rocks _x_, _y_, _z_, and never reaches harbor. Fortunate is he who\\ncan shut out intruding thoughts and think in a straight line. Even with\\nmediocre ability he may accomplish more by his thinking than the\\nbrilliant thinker who is constantly having his mental train wrecked by\\nstray thoughts which slip in on his right of way.\\n\\n\\n5. TYPES OF ATTENTION\\n\\nTHE THREE TYPES OF ATTENTION.--Attention may be secured in three ways:\\n(1) It is demanded by some sudden or intense sensory stimulus or\\ninsistent idea, or (2) it follows interest, or (3) it is compelled by\\nthe will. If it comes in the first way, as from a thunderclap or a flash\\nof light, or from the persistent attempt of some unsought idea to secure\\nentrance into the mind, it is called _involuntary_ attention. This form\\nof attention is of so little importance, comparatively, in our mental\\nlife that we shall not discuss it further.\\n\\nIf attention comes in the second way, following interest, it is called\\n_nonvoluntary_ or spontaneous attention; if in the third, compelled by\\nthe will, _voluntary_ or active attention. Nonvoluntary attention has\\nits motive in some object external to consciousness, or else follows a\\nmore or less uncontrolled current of thought which interests us;\\nvoluntary attention is controlled from within--_we_ decide what we shall\\nattend to instead of letting interesting objects of thought determine it\\nfor us.\\n\\nINTEREST AND NONVOLUNTARY ATTENTION.--In nonvoluntary attention the\\nenvironment largely determines what we shall attend to. All that we have\\nto do with directing this kind of attention is in developing certain\\nlines of interest, and then the interesting things attract attention.\\nThe things we see and hear and touch and taste and smell, the things we\\nlike, the things we do and hope to do--these are the determining factors\\nin our mental life so long as we are giving nonvoluntary attention. Our\\nattention follows the beckoning of these things as the needle the\\nmagnet. It is no effort to attend to them, but rather the effort would\\nbe to keep from attending to them. Who does not remember reading a\\nstory, perhaps a forbidden one, so interesting that when mother called\\nup the stairs for us to come down to attend to some duty, we replied,\\n\"Yes, in a minute,\" and then went on reading! We simply could not stop\\nat that place. The minute lengthens into ten, and another call startles\\nus. \"Yes, I\\'m coming;\" we turn just one more leaf, and are lost again.\\nAt last comes a third call in tones so imperative that it cannot be\\nlonger ignored, and we lay the book down, but open to the place where we\\nleft off, and where we hope soon to begin further to unravel the\\ndelightful mystery. Was it an effort to attend to the reading? Ah, no!\\nit took the combined force of our will and of mother\\'s authority to\\ndrag the attention away. This is nonvoluntary attention.\\n\\nLeft to itself, then, attention simply obeys natural laws and follows\\nthe line of least resistance. By far the larger portion of our attention\\nis of this type. Thought often runs on hour after hour when we are not\\nconscious of effort or struggle to compel us to cease thinking about\\nthis thing and begin thinking about that. Indeed, it may be doubted\\nwhether this is not the case with some persons for days at a time,\\ninstead of hours. The things that present themselves to the mind are the\\nthings which occupy it; the character of the thought is determined by\\nthe character of our interests. It is this fact which makes it vitally\\nnecessary that our interests shall be broad and pure if our thoughts are\\nto be of this type. It is not enough that we have the strength to drive\\nfrom our minds a wrong or impure thought which seeks entrance. To stand\\nguard as a policeman over our thoughts to see that no unworthy one\\nenters, requires too much time and energy. Our interests must be of such\\na nature as to lead us away from the field of unworthy thoughts if we\\nare to be free from their tyranny.\\n\\nTHE WILL AND VOLUNTARY ATTENTION.--In voluntary attention there is a\\nconflict either between the will and interest or between the will and\\nthe mental inertia or laziness, which has to be overcome before we can\\nthink with any degree of concentration. Interest says, \"Follow this\\nline, which is easy and attractive, or which requires but little\\neffort--follow the line of least resistance.\" Will says, \"Quit that line\\nof dalliance and ease, and take this harder way which I direct--cease\\nthe line of least resistance and take the one of greatest resistance.\"\\nWhen day dreams and \"castles in Spain\" attempt to lure you from your\\nlessons, refuse to follow; shut out these vagabond thoughts and stick to\\nyour task. When intellectual inertia deadens your thought and clogs your\\nmental stream, throw it off and court forceful effort. If wrong or\\nimpure thoughts seek entrance to your mind, close and lock your mental\\ndoors to them. If thoughts of desire try to drive out thoughts of duty,\\nbe heroic and insist that thoughts of duty shall have right of way. In\\nshort, see that _you_ are the master of your thinking, and do not let it\\nalways be directed without your consent by influences outside of\\nyourself.\\n\\nIt is just at this point that the strong will wins victory and the weak\\nwill breaks down. Between the ability to control one\\'s thoughts and the\\ninability to control them lies all the difference between right actions\\nand wrong actions; between withstanding temptation and yielding to it;\\nbetween an inefficient purposeless life and a life of purpose and\\nendeavor; between success and failure. For we act in accordance with\\nthose things which our thought rests upon. Suppose two lines of thought\\nrepresented by _A_ and _B_, respectively, lie before you; that _A_ leads\\nto a course of action difficult or unpleasant, but necessary to success\\nor duty, and that _B_ leads to a course of action easy or pleasant, but\\nfatal to success or duty. Which course will you follow--the rugged path\\nof duty or the easier one of pleasure? The answer depends almost wholly,\\nif not entirely, on your power of attention. If your will is strong\\nenough to pull your thoughts away from the fatal but attractive _B_ and\\nhold them resolutely on the less attractive _A_, then _A_ will dictate\\nyour course of action, and you will respond to the call for endeavor,\\nself-denial, and duty; but if your thoughts break away from the\\ndomination of your will and allow the beckoning of your interests\\nalone, then _B_ will dictate your course of action, and you will follow\\nthe leading of ease and pleasure. _For our actions are finally and\\nirrevocably dictated by the things we think about._\\n\\nNOT REALLY DIFFERENT KINDS OF ATTENTION.--It is not to be understood,\\nhowever, from what has been said, that there are _really_ different\\nkinds of attention. All attention denotes an active or dynamic phase of\\nconsciousness. The difference is rather _in the way we secure\\nattention_; whether it is demanded by sudden stimulus, coaxed from us by\\ninteresting objects of thought without effort on our part, or compelled\\nby force of will to desert the more interesting and take the direction\\nwhich we dictate.\\n\\n\\n6. IMPROVING THE POWER OF ATTENTION\\n\\nWhile attention is no doubt partly a natural gift, yet there is probably\\nno power of the mind more susceptible to training than is attention. And\\nwith attention, as with every other power of body and mind, the secret\\nof its development lies in its use. Stated briefly, the only way to\\ntrain attention is by attending. No amount of theorizing or resolving\\ncan take the place of practice in the actual process of attending.\\n\\nMAKING DIFFERENT KINDS OF ATTENTION REËNFORCE EACH OTHER.--A very close\\nrelationship and interdependence exists between nonvoluntary and\\nvoluntary attention. It would be impossible to hold our attention by\\nsheer force of will on objects which were forever devoid of interest;\\nlikewise the blind following of our interests and desires would finally\\nlead to shipwreck in all our lives. Each kind of attention must support\\nand reënforce the other. The lessons, the sermons, the lectures, and\\nthe books in which we are most interested, and hence to which we attend\\nnonvoluntarily and with the least effort and fatigue, are the ones out\\nof which, other things being equal, we get the most and remember the\\nbest and longest. On the other hand, there are sometimes lessons and\\nlectures and books, and many things besides, which are not intensely\\ninteresting, but which should be attended to nevertheless. It is at this\\npoint that the will must step in and take command. If it has not the\\nstrength to do this, it is in so far a weak will, and steps should be\\ntaken to develop it. We are to \"_keep the faculty of effort alive in us\\nby a little gratuitous exercise every day_.\" We are to be systematically\\nheroic in the little points of everyday life and experience. We are not\\nto shrink from tasks because they are difficult or unpleasant. Then,\\nwhen the test comes, we shall not find ourselves unnerved and untrained,\\nbut shall be able to stand in the evil day.\\n\\nTHE HABIT OF ATTENTION.--Finally, one of the chief things in training\\nthe attention is _to form the habit of attending_. This habit is to be\\nformed only by _attending_ whenever and wherever the proper thing to do\\nis to attend, whether \"in work, in play, in making fishing flies, in\\npreparing for an examination, in courting a sweetheart, in reading a\\nbook.\" The lesson, or the sermon, or the lecture, may not be very\\ninteresting; but if they are to be attended to at all, our rule should\\nbe to attend to them completely and absolutely. Not by fits and starts,\\nnow drifting away and now jerking ourselves back, but _all the time_.\\nAnd, furthermore, the one who will deliberately do this will often find\\nthe dull and uninteresting task become more interesting; but if it never\\nbecomes interesting, he is at least forming a habit which will be\\ninvaluable to him through life. On the other hand, the one who fails to\\nattend except when his interest is captured, who never exerts effort to\\ncompel attention, is forming a habit which will be the bane of his\\nthinking until his stream of thought shall end.\\n\\n\\n7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Which fatigues you more, to give attention of the nonvoluntary type,\\nor the voluntary? Which can you maintain longer? Which is the more\\npleasant and agreeable to give? Under which can you accomplish more?\\nWhat bearing have these facts on teaching?\\n\\n2. Try to follow for one or two minutes the \"wave\" in your\\nconsciousness, and then describe the course taken by your attention.\\n\\n3. Have you observed one class alert in attention, and another lifeless\\nand inattentive? Can you explain the causes lying back of this\\ndifference? Estimate the relative amount of work accomplished under the\\ntwo conditions.\\n\\n4. What distractions have you observed in the schoolroom tending to\\nbreak up attention?\\n\\n5. Have you seen pupils inattentive from lack of (1) change, (2) pure\\nair, (3) enthusiasm on the part of the teacher, (4) fatigue, (5) ill\\nhealth?\\n\\n6. Have you noticed a difference in the _habit_ of attention in\\ndifferent pupils? Have you noticed the same thing for whole schools or\\nrooms?\\n\\n7. Do you know of children too much given to daydreaming? Are you?\\n\\n8. Have you seen a teacher rap the desk for attention? What type of\\nattention was secured? Does it pay?\\n\\n9. Have you observed any instance in which pupils\\' lack of attention\\nshould be blamed on the teacher? If so, what was the fault? The remedy?\\n\\n10. Visit a school room or a recitation, and then write an account of\\nthe types and degrees of attention you observed. Try to explain the\\nfactors responsible for any failures in attention, and also those\\nresponsible for the good attention shown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nTHE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\n\\nA fine brain, or a good mind. These terms are often used\\ninterchangeably, as if they stood for the same thing. Yet the brain is\\nmaterial substance--so many cells and fibers, a pulpy protoplasmic mass\\nweighing some three pounds and shut away from the outside world in a\\ncasket of bone. The mind is a spiritual thing--the sum of the processes\\nby which we think and feel and will, mastering our world and\\naccomplishing our destiny.\\n\\n\\n1. THE RELATIONS OF MIND AND BRAIN\\n\\nINTERACTION OF MIND AND BRAIN.--How, then, come these two widely\\ndifferent facts, mind and brain, to be so related in our speech? Why are\\nthe terms so commonly interchanged?--It is because mind and brain are so\\nvitally related in their processes and so inseparably connected in their\\nwork. No movement of our thought, no bit of sensation, no memory, no\\nfeeling, no act of decision but is accompanied by its own particular\\nactivity in the cells of the brain. It is this that the psychologist has\\nin mind when he says, _no psychosis without its corresponding neurosis_.\\n\\nSo far as our present existence is concerned, then, no mind ever works\\nexcept through some brain, and a brain without a mind becomes but a mass\\nof dead matter, so much clay. Mind and brain are perfectly adapted to\\neach other. Nor is this mere accident. For through the ages of man\\'s\\npast history each has grown up and developed into its present state of\\nefficiency by working in conjunction with the other. Each has helped\\nform the other and determine its qualities. Not only is this true for\\nthe race in its evolution, but for every individual as he passes from\\ninfancy to maturity.\\n\\nTHE BRAIN AS THE MIND\\'S MACHINE.--In the first chapter we saw that the\\nbrain does not create the mind, but that the mind works through the\\nbrain. No one can believe that the brain secretes mind as the liver\\nsecretes bile, or that it grinds it out as a mill does flour. Indeed,\\njust what their exact relation is has not yet been settled. Yet it is\\neasy to see that if the mind must use the brain as a machine and work\\nthrough it, then the mind must be subject to the limitations of its\\nmachine, or, in other words, the mind cannot be better than the brain\\nthrough which it operates. A brain and nervous system that are poorly\\ndeveloped or insufficiently nourished mean low grade of efficiency in\\nour mental processes, just as a poorly constructed or wrongly adjusted\\nmotor means loss of power in applying the electric current to its work.\\nWe will, then, look upon the mind and the brain as counterparts of each\\nother, each performing activities which correspond to activities in the\\nother, both inextricably bound together at least so far as this life is\\nconcerned, and each getting its significance by its union with the\\nother. This view will lend interest to a brief study of the brain and\\nnervous system.\\n\\n\\n2. THE MIND\\'S DEPENDENCE ON THE EXTERNAL WORLD\\n\\nBut can we first see how in a general way the brain and nervous system\\nare primarily related to our thinking? Let us go back to the beginning\\nand consider the babe when it first opens its eyes on the scenes of its\\nnew existence. What is in its mind? What does it think about? Nothing.\\nImagine, if you can, a person born blind and deaf, and without the sense\\nof touch, taste, or smell. Let such a person live on for a year, for\\nfive years, for a lifetime. What would he know? What ray of intelligence\\nwould enter his mind? What would he think about? All would be dark to\\nhis eyes, all silent to his ears, all tasteless to his mouth, all\\nodorless to his nostrils, all touchless to his skin. His mind would be a\\nblank. He would have no mind. He could not get started to think. He\\ncould not get started to act. He would belong to a lower scale of life\\nthan the tiny animal that floats with the waves and the tide in the\\nocean without power to direct its own course. He would be but an inert\\nmass of flesh without sense or intelligence.\\n\\nTHE MIND AT BIRTH.--Yet this is the condition of the babe at birth. It\\nis born practically blind and deaf, without definite sense of taste or\\nsmell. Born without anything to think about, and no way to get anything\\nto think about until the senses wake up and furnish some material from\\nthe outside world. Born with all the mechanism of muscle and nerve ready\\nto perform the countless complex movements of arms and legs and body\\nwhich characterize every child, he could not successfully start these\\nactivities without a message from the senses to set them going. At birth\\nthe child probably has only the senses of contact and temperature\\npresent with any degree of clearness; taste soon follows; vision of an\\nimperfect sort in a few days; hearing about the same time, and smell a\\nlittle later. The senses are waking up and beginning their acquaintance\\nwith the outside world.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--A NEURONE FROM A HUMAN SPINAL CORD. The central\\nportion represents the cell body. N, the nucleus; P, a pigmented or\\ncolored spot; D, a dendrite, or relatively short fiber,--which branches\\nfreely; A, an axon or long fiber, which branches but little.]\\n\\nTHE WORK OF THE SENSES.--And what a problem the senses have to solve! On\\nthe one hand the great universe of sights and sounds, of tastes and\\nsmells, of contacts and temperatures, and whatever else may belong to\\nthe material world in which we live; and on the other hand the little\\nshapeless mass of gray and white pulpy matter called the brain,\\nincapable of sustaining its own shape, shut away in the darkness of a\\nbony case with no possibility of contact with the outside world, and\\npossessing no means of communicating with it except through the senses.\\nAnd yet this universe of external things must be brought into\\ncommunication with the seemingly insignificant but really wonderful\\nbrain, else the mind could never be. Here we discover, then, the two\\ngreat factors which first require our study if we would understand the\\ngrowth of the mind--_the material world without, and the brain within_.\\nFor it is the action and interaction of these which lie at the bottom of\\nthe mind\\'s development. Let us first look a little more closely at the\\nbrain and the accompanying nervous system.\\n\\n\\n3. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nIt will help in understanding both the structure and the working of the\\nnervous system to keep in mind that it contains _but one fundamental\\nunit of structure_. This is the neurone. Just as the house is built up\\nby adding brick upon brick, so brain, cord, nerves and organs of sense\\nare formed by the union of numberless neurones.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Neurones in different stages of development,\\nfrom _a_ to _e_. In _a_, the elementary cell body alone is present; in\\n_c_, a dendrite is shown projecting upward and an axon downward.--After\\nDONALDSON.]\\n\\nTHE NEURONE.--What, then, is a neurone? What is its structure, its\\nfunction, how does it act? A neurone is _a protoplasmic cell, with its\\noutgrowing fibers_. The cell part of the neurone is of a variety of\\nshapes, triangular, pyramidal, cylindrical, and irregular. The cells\\nvary in size from 1/250 to 1/3500 of an inch in diameter. In general the\\nfunction of the cell is thought to be to generate the nervous energy\\nresponsible for our consciousness--sensation, memory, reasoning, feeling\\nand all the rest, and for our movements. The cell also provides for the\\nnutrition of the fibers.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Longitudinal (a) and Transverse (b) section of\\nnerve fiber. The heavy border represents the medullary, or enveloping\\nsheath, which becomes thicker in the larger fibers.--After DONALDSON.]\\n\\nNEURONE FIBERS.--The neurone fibers are of two kinds, _dendrites_ and\\n_axons_. The dendrites are comparatively large in diameter, branch\\nfreely, like the branches of a tree, and extend but a relatively short\\ndistance from the parent cell. Axons are slender, and branch but little,\\nand then approximately at right angles. They reach a much greater\\ndistance from the cell body than the dendrites. Neurones vary greatly in\\nlength. Some of those found in the spinal cord and brain are not more\\nthan 1/12 of an inch long, while others which reach from the extremities\\nto the cord, measure several feet. Both dendrites and axons are of\\ndiameter so small as to be invisible except under the microscope.\\n\\nNEUROGLIA.--Out of this simple structural element, the neurone, the\\nentire nervous system is built. True, the neurones are held in place,\\nand perhaps insulated, by a kind of soft cement called _neuroglia_. But\\nthis seems to possess no strictly nervous function. The number of the\\nmicroscopic neurones required to make up the mass of the brain, cord and\\nperipheral nervous system is far beyond our mental grasp. It is computed\\nthat the brain and cord contain some 3,000 millions of them.\\n\\nCOMPLEXITY OF THE BRAIN.--Something of the complexity of the brain\\nstructure can best be understood by an illustration. Professor Stratton\\nestimates that if we were to make a model of the human brain, using for\\nthe neurone fibers wires so small as to be barely visible to the eye, in\\norder to find room for all the wires the model would need to be the size\\nof a city block on the base and correspondingly high. Imagine a\\ntelephone system of this complexity operating from one switch-board!\\n\\n\"GRAY\" AND \"WHITE\" MATTER.--The \"gray matter\" of the brain and cord is\\nmade up of nerve cells and their dendrites, and the terminations of\\naxons, which enter from the adjoining white matter. A part of the mass\\nof gray matter also consists of the neuroglia which surrounds the nerve\\ncells and fibers, and a network of blood vessels. The \"white matter\" of\\nthe central system consists chiefly of axons with their enveloping or\\nmedullary, sheath and neuroglia. The white matter contains no nerve\\ncells or dendrites. The difference in color of the gray and the white\\nmatter is caused chiefly by the fact that in the gray masses the\\nmedullary sheath, which is white, is lacking, thus revealing the ashen\\ngray of the nerve threads. In the white masses the medullary sheath is\\npresent.\\n\\n\\n4. GROSS STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nDIVISIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.--The nervous system may be considered\\nin two divisions: (1) The _central_ system, which consists of the brain\\nand spinal cord, and (2) the _peripheral_ system, which comprises the\\nsensory and motor neurones connecting the periphery and the internal\\norgans with the central system and the specialized end-organs of the\\nsenses. The _sympathetic_ system, which is found as a double chain of\\nnerve connections joining the roots of sensory and motor nerves just\\noutside the spinal column, does not seem to be directly related to\\nconsciousness and so will not be discussed here. A brief description of\\nthe nervous system will help us better to understand how its parts all\\nwork together in so wonderful a way to accomplish their great result.\\n\\nTHE CENTRAL SYSTEM.--In the brain we easily distinguish three major\\ndivisions--the _cerebrum_, the _cerebellum_ and the _medulla oblongata_.\\nThe medulla is but the enlarged upper part of the cord where it connects\\nwith the brain. It is about an inch and a quarter long, and is composed\\nof both medullated and unmedullated fibers--that is of both \"white\" and\\n\"gray\" matter. In the medulla, the unmedullated neurones which comprise\\nthe center of the cord are passing to the outside, and the medullated to\\nthe inside, thus taking the positions they occupy in the cerebrum. Here\\nalso the neurones are crossing, or changing sides, so that those which\\npass up the right side of the cord finally connect with the left side of\\nthe brain, and vice versa.\\n\\nTHE CEREBELLUM.--Lying just back of the medulla and at the rear part of\\nthe base of the cerebrum is the cerebellum, or \"little brain,\"\\napproximately as large as the fist, and composed of a complex\\narrangement of white and gray matter. Fibers from the spinal cord enter\\nthis mass, and others emerge and pass on into the cerebrum, while its\\ntwo halves also are connected with each other by means of cross fibers.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--View of the under side of the brain. B, basis of\\nthe crura; P, pons; Mo, medulla oblongata; Ce, cerebellum; Sc, spinal\\ncord.]\\n\\nTHE CEREBRUM.--The cerebrum occupies all the upper part of the skull\\nfrom the front to the rear. It is divided symmetrically into two\\nhemispheres, the right and the left. These hemispheres are connected\\nwith each other by a small bridge of fibers called the _corpus\\ncallosum_. Each hemisphere is furrowed and ridged with convolutions, an\\narrangement which allows greater surface for the distribution of the\\ngray cellular matter over it. Besides these irregularities of surface,\\neach hemisphere is marked also by two deep clefts or _fissures_--the\\nfissure of Rolando, extending from the middle upper part of the\\nhemisphere downward and forward, passing a little in front of the ear\\nand stopping on a level with the upper part of it; and the fissure of\\nSylvius, beginning at the base of the brain somewhat in front of the\\near and extending upward and backward at an acute angle with the base\\nof the hemisphere.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diagrammatic side view of brain, showing\\ncerebellum (CB) and medulla oblongata (MO). F\\' F\\'\\' F\\'\\'\\' are placed on\\nthe first, second, and third frontal convolutions, respectively; AF, on\\nthe ascending frontal; AP, on the ascending parietal; M, on the\\nmarginal; A, on the angular. T\\' T\\'\\' T\\'\\'\\' are placed on the first,\\nsecond, and third temporal convolutions. R-R marks the fissure of\\nRolando; S-S, the fissure of Sylvius; PO, the parieto-occipital\\nfissure.]\\n\\nThe surface of each hemisphere may be thought of as mapped out into four\\nlobes: The frontal lobe, which includes the front part of the hemisphere\\nand extends back to the fissure of Rolando and down to the fissure of\\nSylvius; the parietal lobe, which lies back of the fissure of Rolando\\nand above that of Sylvius and extends back to the occipital lobe; the\\noccipital lobe, which includes the extreme rear portion of the\\nhemisphere; and the temporal lobe, which lies below the fissure of\\nSylvius and extends back to the occipital lobe.\\n\\nTHE CORTEX.--The gray matter of the hemispheres, unlike that of the\\ncord, lies on the surface. This gray exterior portion of the cerebrum is\\ncalled the _cortex_, and varies from one-twelfth to one-eighth of an\\ninch in thickness. The cortex is the seat of all consciousness and of\\nthe control of voluntary movement.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Different aspects of sections of the spinal\\ncord and of the roots of the spinal nerves from the cervical region: 1,\\ndifferent views of anterior median fissure; 2, posterior fissure; 3,\\nanterior lateral depression for anterior roots; 4, posterior lateral\\ndepression for posterior roots; 5 and 6, anterior and posterior roots,\\nrespectively; 7, complete spinal nerve, formed by the union of the\\nanterior and posterior roots.]\\n\\nTHE SPINAL CORD.--The spinal cord proceeds from the base of the brain\\ndownward about eighteen inches through a canal provided for it in the\\nvertebræ of the spinal column. It is composed of white matter on the\\noutside, and gray matter within. A deep fissure on the anterior side and\\nanother on the posterior cleave the cord nearly in twain, resembling the\\nbrain in this particular. The gray matter on the interior is in the form\\nof two crescents connected by a narrow bar.\\n\\nThe _peripheral_ nervous system consists of thirty-one pairs of\\n_nerves_, with their end-organs, branching off from the cord, and twelve\\npairs that have their roots in the brain. Branches of these forty-three\\npairs of nerves reach to every part of the periphery of the body and to\\nall the internal organs.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The projection fibers of the brain. I-IX, the\\nfirst nine pairs of cranial nerves.]\\n\\nIt will help in understanding the peripheral system to remember that a\\n_nerve_ consists of a bundle of neurone fibers each wrapped in its\\nmedullary sheath and sheath of Schwann. Around this bundle of neurones,\\nthat is around the nerve, is still another wrapping, silvery-white,\\ncalled the neurilemma. The number of fibers going to make up a nerve\\nvaries from about 5,000 to 100,000. Nerves can easily be identified in a\\npiece of lean beef, or even at the edge of a serious gash in one\\'s own\\nflesh!\\n\\nBundles of sensory fibers constituting a sensory nerve root enter the\\nspinal cord on the posterior side through holes in the vertebræ. Similar\\nbundles of motor fibers in the form of a motor nerve root emerge from\\nthe cord at the same level. Soon after their emergence from the cord,\\nthese two nerves are wrapped together in the same sheath and proceed in\\nthis way to the periphery of the body, where the sensory nerve usually\\nends in a specialized _end-organ_ fitted to respond to some certain\\nstimulus from the outside world. The motor nerve ends in minute\\nfilaments in the muscular organ which it governs. Both sensory and motor\\nnerves connect with fibers of like kind in the cord and these in turn\\nwith the cortex, thus giving every part of the periphery direct\\nconnection with the cortex.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Schematic diagram showing association fibers\\nconnecting cortical centers with each other.--After JAMES and STARR.]\\n\\nThe _end-organs_ of the sensory nerves are nerve masses, some of them,\\nas the taste buds of the tongue, relatively simple; and others, as the\\neye or ear, very complex. They are all alike in one particular; namely,\\nthat each is fitted for its own particular work and can do no other.\\nThus the eye is the end-organ of sight, and is a wonderfully complex\\narrangement of nerve structure combined with refracting media, and\\narranged to respond to the rapid ether waves of light. The ear has for\\nits essential part the specialized endings of the auditory nerve, and is\\nfitted to respond to the waves carried to it in the air, giving the\\nsensation of sound. The end-organs of touch, found in greatest\\nperfection in the finger tips, are of several kinds, all very\\ncomplicated in structure. And so on with each of the senses. Each\\nparticular sense has some form of end-organ specially adapted to respond\\nto the kind of stimulus upon which its sensation depends, and each is\\ninsensible to the stimuli of the others, much as the receiver of a\\ntelephone will respond to the tones of our voice, but not to the touch\\nof our fingers as will the telegraph instrument, and _vice versa_. Thus\\nthe eye is not affected by sounds, nor touch by light. Yet by means of\\nall the senses together we are able to come in contact with the material\\nworld in a variety of ways.\\n\\n\\n5. LOCALIZATION OF FUNCTION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nDIVISION OF LABOR.--Division of labor is the law in the organic world as\\nin the industrial. Animals of the lowest type, such as the amoeba, do\\nnot have separate organs for respiration, digestion, assimilation,\\nelimination, etc., the one tissue performing all of these functions. But\\nin the higher forms each organ not only has its own specific work, but\\neven within the same organ each part has its own particular function\\nassigned. Thus we have seen that the two parts of the neurone probably\\nperform different functions, the cells generating energy and the fibers\\ntransmitting it.\\n\\nIt will not seem strange, then, that there is also a division of labor\\nin the cellular matter itself in the nervous system. For example, the\\nlittle masses of ganglia which are distributed at intervals along the\\nnerves are probably for the purpose of reënforcing the nerve current,\\nmuch as the battery cells in the local telegraph office reënforce the\\ncurrent from the central office. The cellular matter in the spinal cord\\nand lower parts of the brain has a very important work to perform in\\nreceiving messages from the senses and responding to them in directing\\nthe simpler reflex acts and movements which we learn to execute without\\nour consciousness being called upon, thus leaving the mind free from\\nthese petty things to busy itself in higher ways. The cellular matter of\\nthe cortex performs the highest functions of all, for through its\\nactivity we have consciousness.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Side view of left hemisphere of human brain,\\nshowing the principal localized areas.]\\n\\nThe gray matter of the cerebellum, the medulla, and the cord may receive\\nimpressions from the senses and respond to them with movements, but\\ntheir response is in all cases wholly automatic and unconscious. A\\nperson whose hemispheres had been injured in such a way as to interfere\\nwith the activity of the cortex might still continue to perform most if\\nnot all of the habitual movements of his life, but they would be\\nmechanical and not intelligent. He would lack all higher consciousness.\\nIt is through the activity of this thin covering of cellular matter of\\nthe cerebrum, the _cortex_, that our minds operate; here are received\\nstimuli from the different senses, and here sensations are experienced.\\nHere all our movements which are consciously directed have their origin.\\nAnd here all our thinking, feeling, and willing are done.\\n\\nDIVISION OF LABOR IN THE CORTEX.--Nor does the division of labor in the\\nnervous system end with this assignment of work. The cortex itself\\nprobably works essentially as a unit, yet it is through a shifting of\\ntensions from one area to another that it acts, now giving us a\\nsensation, now directing a movement, and now thinking a thought or\\nfeeling an emotion. Localization of function is the rule here also.\\nCertain areas of the cortex are devoted chiefly to sensations, others to\\nmotor impulses, and others to higher thought activities, yet in such a\\nway that all work together in perfect harmony, each reënforcing the\\nother and making its work significant. Thus the front portion of the\\ncortex seems to be devoted to the higher thought activities; the region\\non both sides of the fissure of Rolando, to motor activities; and the\\nrear and lower parts to sensory activities; and all are bound together\\nand made to work together by the association fibers of the brain.\\n\\nIn the case of the higher thought activities, it is not probable that\\none section of the frontal lobes of the cortex is set apart for\\nthinking, one for feeling, and one for willing, etc., but rather that\\nthe whole frontal part of the cortex is concerned in each. In the motor\\nand sensory areas, however, the case is different; for here a still\\nfurther division of labor occurs. For example, in the motor region one\\nsmall area seems connected with movements of the head, one with the arm,\\none with the leg, one with the face, and another with the organs of\\nspeech; likewise in the sensory region, one area is devoted to vision,\\none to hearing, one to taste and smell, and one to touch, etc. We must\\nbear in mind, however, that these regions are not mapped out as\\naccurately as are the boundaries of our states--that no part of the\\nbrain is restricted wholly to either sensory or motor nerves, and that\\nno part works by itself independently of the rest of the brain. We name\\na tract from the predominance of nerves which end there, or from the\\nchief functions which the area performs. The motor localization seems to\\nbe the most perfect. Indeed, experimentation on the brains of monkeys\\nhas been successful in mapping out motor areas so accurately that such\\nsmall centers as those connected with the bending of one particular leg\\nor the flexing of a thumb have been located. Yet each area of the cortex\\nis so connected with every other area by the millions of association\\nfibers that the whole brain is capable of working together as a unit,\\nthus unifying and harmonizing our thoughts, emotions, and acts.\\n\\n\\n6. FORMS OF SENSORY STIMULI\\n\\nLet us next inquire how this mechanism of the nervous system is acted\\nupon in such a way as to give us sensations. In order to understand\\nthis, we must first know that all forms of matter are composed of minute\\natoms which are in constant motion, and by imparting this motion to the\\nair or the ether which surrounds them, are constantly radiating energy\\nin the form of minute waves throughout space. These waves, or\\nradiations, are incredibly rapid in some instances and rather slow in\\nothers. In sending out its energy in the form of these waves, the\\nphysical world is doing its part to permit us to form its acquaintance.\\nThe end-organs of the sensory nerves must meet this advance half-way,\\nand be so constructed as to be affected by the different forms of energy\\nwhich are constantly beating upon them.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--The prism\\'s analysis of a bundle of light rays.\\nOn the right are shown the relation of vibration rates to temperature\\nstimuli, to light and to chemical stimuli. The rates are given in\\nbillions per second.--After WITMER.]\\n\\nTHE END-ORGANS AND THEIR RESPONSE TO STIMULI.--Thus the radiations of\\nether from the sun, our chief source of light, are so rapid that\\nbillions of them enter the eye in a second of time, and the retina is of\\nsuch a nature that its nerve cells are thrown into activity by these\\nwaves; the impulse is carried over the optic nerve to the occipital lobe\\nof the cortex, and the sensation of sight is the result. The different\\ncolors also, from the red of the spectrum to the violet, are the result\\nof different vibration rates in the waves of ether which strike the\\nretina; and in order to perceive color, the retina must be able to\\nrespond to the particular vibration rate which represents each color.\\nLikewise in the sense of touch the end-organs are fitted to respond to\\nvery rapid vibrations, and it is possible that the different qualities\\nof touch are produced by different vibration rates in the atoms of the\\nobject we are touching. When we reach the ear, we have the organ which\\nresponds to the lowest vibration rate of all, for we can detect a sound\\nmade by an object which is vibrating from twenty to thirty times a\\nsecond. The highest vibration rate which will affect the ear is some\\nforty thousand per second.\\n\\nThus it is seen that there are great gaps in the different rates to\\nwhich our senses are fitted to respond--a sudden drop from billions in\\nthe case of the eye to millions in touch, and to thousands or even tens\\nin hearing. This makes one wonder whether there are not many things in\\nnature which man has never discovered simply because he has not the\\nsense mechanism enabling him to become conscious of their existence.\\nThere are undoubtedly \"more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt\\nof in our philosophy.\"\\n\\nDEPENDENCE OF THE MIND ON THE SENSES.--Only as the senses bring in the\\nmaterial, has the mind anything with which to build. Thus have the\\nsenses to act as messengers between the great outside world and the\\nbrain; to be the servants who shall stand at the doorways of the\\nbody--the eyes, the ears, the finger tips--each ready to receive its\\nparticular kind of impulse from nature and send it along the right path\\nto the part of the cortex where it belongs, so that the mind can say, \"A\\nsight,\" \"A sound,\" or \"A touch.\" Thus does the mind come to know the\\nuniverse of the senses. Thus does it get the material out of which\\nmemory, imagination, and thought begin. Thus and only thus does the mind\\nsecure the crude material from which the finished superstructure is\\nfinally built.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nMENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING\\n\\n\\nEducation was long looked upon as affecting the mind only; the body was\\neither left out of account or neglected. Later science has shown,\\nhowever, that the mind cannot be trained _except as the nervous system\\nis trained and developed_. For not sensation and the simpler mental\\nprocesses alone, but memory, imagination, judgment, reasoning and every\\nother act of the mind are dependent on the nervous system finally for\\ntheir efficiency. The little child gets its first mental experiences in\\nconnection with certain movements or acts set up reflexly by the\\npre-organized nervous system. From this time on movement and idea are so\\ninextricably bound together that they cannot be separated. The mind and\\nthe brain are so vitally related that it is impossible to educate one\\nwithout performing a like office for the other; and it is likewise\\nimpossible to neglect the one without causing the other to suffer in its\\ndevelopment.\\n\\n\\n1. FACTORS DETERMINING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nDEVELOPMENT AND NUTRITION.--Ignoring the native differences in nervous\\nsystems through the influence of heredity, the efficiency of a nervous\\nsystem is largely dependent on two factors: (1) The development of the\\ncells and fibers of which it is composed, and (2) its general tone of\\nhealth and vigor. The actual number of cells in the nervous system\\nincreases but little if at all after birth. Indeed, it is doubtful\\nwhether Edison\\'s brain and nervous system has a greater number of cells\\nin it than yours or mine. The difference between the brain of a genius\\nand that of an ordinary man is not in the _number_ of cells which it\\ncontains, but rather in the development of the cells and fibers which\\nare present, potentially, at least, in every nervous system. The\\nhistologist tells us that in the nervous system of every child there are\\ntens of thousands of cells which are so immature and undeveloped that\\nthey are useless; indeed, this is the case to some degree in every adult\\nperson\\'s nervous system as well. Thus each individual has inherent in\\nhis nervous system potentialities of which he has never taken advantage,\\nthe utilizing of which may make him a genius and the neglecting of which\\nwill certainly leave him on the plane of mediocrity. The first problem\\nin education, then, is to take the unripe and inefficient nervous system\\nand so develop it in connection with the growing mind that the\\npossibilities which nature has stored in it shall become actualities.\\n\\nUNDEVELOPED CELLS.--Professor Donaldson tells us on this point that: \"At\\nbirth, and for a long time after, many [nervous] systems contain cell\\nelements which are more or less immature, not forming a functional part\\nof the tissue, and yet under some conditions capable of further\\ndevelopment.... For the cells which are continually appearing in the\\ndeveloping cortex no other source is known than the nuclei or granules\\nfound there in its earliest stages. These elements are metamorphosed\\nneuroblasts--that is, elementary cells out of which the nervous matter\\nis developed--which have shrunken to a volume less than that which they\\nhad at first, and which remain small until, in the subsequent process of\\nenlargement necessary for their full development, they expand into\\nwell-marked cells. Elements intermediate between these granules and the\\nfully developed cells are always found, even in mature brains, and\\ntherefore it is inferred that the latter are derived from the former.\\nThe appearances there also lead to the conclusion that many elements\\nwhich might possibly develop in any given case are far beyond the number\\nthat actually does so.... The possible number of cells latent and\\nfunctional in the central system is early fixed. At any age this number\\nis accordingly represented by the granules as well as by the cells which\\nhave already undergone further development. During growth the proportion\\nof developed cells increases, and sometimes, owing to the failure to\\nrecognize potential nerve cells in the granules, the impression is\\ncarried away that this increase implies the formation of new elements.\\nAs has been shown, such is not the case.\"[1]\\n\\nDEVELOPMENT OF NERVE FIBERS.--The nerve _fibers_, no less than the\\ncells, must go through a process of development. It has already been\\nshown that the fibers are the result of a branching of cells. At birth\\nmany of the cells have not yet thrown out branches, and hence the fibers\\nare lacking; while many of those which are already grown out are not\\nsufficiently developed to transmit impulses accurately. Thus it has been\\nfound that most children at birth are able to support the weight of the\\nbody for several seconds by clasping the fingers around a small rod, but\\nit takes about a year for the child to become able to stand. It is\\nevident that it requires more actual strength to cling to a rod than to\\nstand; hence the conclusion is that the difference is in the earlier\\ndevelopment of the nerve centers which have to do with clasping than of\\nthose concerned in standing. Likewise the child\\'s first attempts to feed\\nhimself or do any one of the thousand little things about which he is so\\nawkward, are partial failures not so much because he has not had\\npractice as because his nervous machinery connected with those movements\\nis not yet developed sufficiently to enable him to be accurate. His\\nbrain is in a condition which Flechsig calls \"unripe.\" How, then, shall\\nthe undeveloped cells and system ripen? How shall the undeveloped cells\\nand fibers grow to full maturity and efficiency?\\n\\n\\n2. DEVELOPMENT OF NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH USE\\n\\nIMPORTANCE OF STIMULUS AND RESPONSE.--Like all other tissues of the\\nbody, the nerve cells and fibers are developed by judicious use. The\\nsensory and association centers require the constant stimulus of nerve\\ncurrents running in from the various end-organs, and the motor centers\\nrequire the constant stimulus of currents running from them out to the\\nmuscles. In other words, the conditions upon which both motor and\\nsensory development depend are: (1) A rich environment of sights and\\nsounds and tastes and smells, and everything else which serves as proper\\nstimulus to the sense organs, and to every form of intellectual and\\nsocial interest; and (2) no less important, an opportunity for the\\nfreest and most complete forms of response and motor activity.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Schematic transverse section of the human brain\\nshowing the projection of the motor fibers, their crossing in the\\nneighborhood of the medulla, and their termination in the different\\nareas of localized function in the cortex. S, fissure of Sylvius; M, the\\nmedulla; VII, the roots of the facial nerves.]\\n\\nAn illustration of the effects of the lack of sensory stimuli on the\\ncortex is well shown in the case of Laura Bridgman, whose brain was\\nstudied by Professor Donaldson after her death. Laura Bridgman was born\\na normal child, and developed as other children do up to the age of\\nnearly three years. At this time, through an attack of scarlet fever,\\nshe lost her hearing completely and also the sight of her left eye. Her\\nright eye was so badly affected that she could see but little; and it,\\ntoo, became entirely blind when she was eight. She lived in this\\ncondition until she was sixty years old, when she died. Professor\\nDonaldson submitted the cortex of her brain to a most careful\\nexamination, also comparing the corresponding areas on the two\\nhemispheres with each other. He found that as a whole the cortex was\\nthinner than in the case of normal individuals. He found also that the\\ncortical area connected with the left eye--namely, the right occipital\\nregion--was much thinner than that for the right eye, which had retained\\nits sight longer than the other. He says: \"It is interesting to notice\\nthat those parts of the cortex which, according to the current view,\\nwere associated with the defective sense organs were also particularly\\nthin. The cause of this thinness was found to be due, at least in part,\\nto the small size of the nerve cells there present. Not only were the\\nlarge and medium-sized cells smaller, but the impression made on the\\nobserver was that they were also less numerous than in the normal\\ncortex.\"\\n\\nEFFECT OF SENSORY STIMULI.--No doubt if we could examine the brain of a\\nperson who has grown up in an environment rich in stimuli to the eye,\\nwhere nature, earth, and sky have presented a changing panorama of color\\nand form to attract the eye; where all the sounds of nature, from the\\nchirp of the insect to the roar of the waves and the murmur of the\\nbreeze, and from the softest tones of the voice to the mightiest sweep\\nof the great orchestra, have challenged the ear; where many and varied\\nodors and perfumes have assailed the nostrils; where a great range of\\ntastes have tempted the palate; where many varieties of touch and\\ntemperature sensations have been experienced--no doubt if we could\\nexamine such a brain we should find the sensory areas of the cortex\\nexcelling in thickness because its cells were well developed and full\\nsized from the currents which had been pouring into them from the\\noutside world. On the other hand, if we could examine a cortex which had\\nlacked any one of these stimuli, we should find some area in it\\nundeveloped because of this deficiency. Its owner therefore possesses\\nbut the fraction of a brain, and would in a corresponding degree find\\nhis mind incomplete.\\n\\nNECESSITY FOR MOTOR ACTIVITY.--Likewise in the case of the motor areas.\\nPity the boy or girl who has been deprived of the opportunity to use\\nevery muscle to the fullest extent in the unrestricted plays and games\\nof childhood. For where such activities are not wide in their scope,\\nthere some areas of the cortex will remain undeveloped, because unused,\\nand the person will be handicapped later in his life from lack of skill\\nin the activities depending on these centers. Halleck says in this\\nconnection: \"If we could examine the developing motor region with a\\nmicroscope of sufficient magnifying power, it is conceivable that we\\nmight learn wherein the modification due to exercise consists. We might\\nalso, under such conditions, be able to say, \\'This is the motor region\\nof a piano player; the modifications here correspond precisely to those\\nnecessary for controlling such movements of the hand.\\' Or, \\'This is the\\nmotor tract of a blacksmith; this, of an engraver; and these must be the\\ncells which govern the vocal organs of an orator.\\'\" Whether or not the\\nmicroscope will ever reveal such things to us, there is no doubt that\\nthe conditions suggested exist, and that back of every inefficient and\\nawkward attempt at physical control lies a motor area with its cells\\nundeveloped by use. No wonder that our processes of learning physical\\nadjustment and control are slow, for they are a growth in the brain\\nrather than a simple \"learning how.\"\\n\\nThe training of the nervous system consists finally, then, in the\\ndevelopment and coördination of the neurones of which it is composed. We\\nhave seen that the sensory cells are to be developed by the sensory\\nstimuli pouring in upon them, and the motor cells by the motor impulses\\nwhich they send out to the muscles. The sensory and the motor fibers\\nlikewise, being an outgrowth of their respective cells, find their\\ndevelopment in carrying the impulses which result in sensation and\\nmovement. Thus it is seen that the neurone is, in its development as in\\nits work, a unit.\\n\\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION CENTERS.--To this simpler type of sensory\\nand motor development which we have been considering, we must add that\\nwhich comes from the more complex mental processes, such as memory,\\nthought, and imagination. For it is in connection with these that the\\nassociation fibers are developed, and the brain areas so connected that\\nthey can work together as a unit. A simple illustration will enable us\\nto see more clearly how the nervous mechanism acts to bring this about.\\n\\nSuppose that I am walking along a country road deeply engaged in\\nmeditation, and that I come to a puddle of water in my pathway. I may\\nturn aside and avoid the obstruction without my attention being called\\nto it, and without interruption of my train of thought. The act has been\\nautomatic. In this case the nerve current has passed from the eye (_S_)\\nover an afferent fiber to a sensory center (_s_) in the nervous system\\nbelow the cortex; from there it has been forwarded to a motor center\\n(_m_) in the same region, and on out over a motor fiber to the proper\\nmuscles (_M_), which are to execute the required act. The act having\\nbeen completed, the sensory nerves connected with the muscles employed\\nreport the fact back that the work is done, thus completing the circuit.\\nThis event may be taken as an illustration of literally thousands of\\nacts which we perform daily without the intervention of consciousness,\\nand hence without involving the hemispheres.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Diagram illustrating the paths of association.]\\n\\nIf, however, instead of avoiding the puddle unconsciously, I do so from\\nconsideration of the danger of wet feet and the disagreeableness of\\nsoiled shoes and the ridiculous appearance I shall make, then the\\ncurrent cannot take the short circuit, but must pass on up to the\\ncortex. Here it awakens consciousness to take notice of the obstruction,\\nand calls forth the images which aid in directing the necessary\\nmovements. This simple illustration may be greatly complicated,\\nsubstituting for it one of the more complex problems which are\\ncontinually presenting themselves to us for solution, or the associated\\ntrains of thought that are constantly occupying our minds. But the truth\\nof the illustration still holds. Whether in the simple or the complex\\nact, there is always a forward passing of the nerve current through the\\nsensory and thought centers, and on out through the motor centers to the\\norgans which are to be concerned in the motor response.\\n\\nTHE FACTORS INVOLVED IN A SIMPLE ACTION.--Thus it will be seen that in\\nthe simplest act which can be considered there are the following\\nfactors: (1) The stimulus which acts on the end-organ; (2) the ingoing\\ncurrent over an afferent nerve; (3) the sensory or interpreting cells;\\n(4) the fibers connecting the sensory with a motor center; (5) the motor\\ncells; (6) the efferent nerve to carry the direction for the movement\\noutward to the muscle; (7) the motor response; and, finally, (8) the\\nreport back that the act has been performed. With this in mind it fairly\\nbewilders one to think of the marvelous complexity of the work that is\\ngoing on in our nervous mechanism every moment of our life, even without\\nconsidering the higher thought processes at all. How, with these added,\\nthe resulting complexity all works out into beautiful harmony is indeed\\nbeyond comprehension.\\n\\n\\n3. EDUCATION AND THE TRAINING OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nFortunately, many of the best opportunities for sensory and motor\\ntraining do not depend on schools or courses of study. The world is full\\nof stimuli to our senses and to our social natures; and our common lives\\nare made up of the responses we make to these stimuli,--the movements,\\nacts and deeds by which we fit ourselves into our world of environment.\\nUndoubtedly the most rapid and vital progress we make in our development\\nis accomplished in the years before we have reached the age to go to\\nschool. Yet it is the business of education to see that we do not lack\\nany essential opportunity, to make sure that necessary lines of stimuli\\nor of motor training have not been omitted from our development.\\n\\nEDUCATION TO SUPPLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR STIMULUS AND RESPONSE.--The great\\nproblem of education is, on the physical side, it would seem, then, to\\nprovide for ourselves and those we seek to educate as rich an\\nenvironment of sensory and social stimuli as possible; one whose\\nimpressions will be full of suggestions to response in motor activity\\nand the higher thought processes; and then to give opportunity for\\nthought and for expression in acts and deeds in the largest possible\\nnumber of lines. And added to this must be frequent and clear sensory\\nand motor recall, a living over again of the sights and sounds and odors\\nand the motor activities we have once experienced. There must also be\\nthe opportunity for the forming of worthy plans and ideals. For in this\\nway the brain centers which were concerned in the original sensation or\\nthought or movement are again brought into exercise, and their\\ndevelopment continued. Through recall and imagination we are able not\\nonly greatly to multiply the effects of the immediate sensory and motor\\nstimuli which come to us, but also to improve our power of thinking by\\ngetting a fund of material upon which the mind can draw.\\n\\nORDER OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.--Nature has set the order in\\nwhich the powers of the nervous system shall develop. And we must follow\\nthis order if we would obtain the best results. Stated in technical\\nterms, the order is _from fundamental to accessory_. This is to say that\\nthe nerve centers controlling the larger and more general movements of\\nthe body ripen first, and those governing the finer motor adjustments\\nlater. For example, the larger body muscles of the child which are\\nconcerned with sitting up come under control earlier than those\\nconnected with walking. The arm muscles develop control earlier than the\\nfinger muscles, and the head and neck muscles earlier than the eye\\nmuscles. So also the more general and less highly specialized powers of\\nthe mind ripen sooner than the more highly specialized. Perception and\\nobservation precede powers of critical judgment and association. Memory\\nand imagination ripen earlier than reasoning and the logical ability.\\n\\nThis all means that our educational system must be planned to follow the\\norder of nature. Children of the primary grades should not be required\\nto write with fine pencils or pens which demand delicate finger\\nadjustments, since the brain centers for these finer coördinations are\\nnot yet developed. Young children should not be set at work\\nnecessitating difficult eye control, such as stitching through\\nperforated cardboard, reading fine print and the like, as their eyes\\nare not yet ready for such tasks. The more difficult analytical problems\\nof arithmetic and relations of grammar should not be required of pupils\\nat a time when the association areas of the brain are not yet ready for\\nthis type of thinking. For such methods violate the law of nature, and\\nthe child is sure to suffer the penalty.\\n\\n\\n4. IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH AND VIGOR OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n\\nParallel with opportunities for proper stimuli and response the nervous\\nsystem must possess good _tonicity_, or vigor. This depends in large\\ndegree on general health and nutrition, with freedom from overfatigue.\\nNo favorableness of environment nor excellence of training can result in\\nan efficient brain if the nerve energy has run low from depleted health,\\nwant of proper nourishment, or exhaustion.\\n\\nTHE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE.--Histologists find that the nuclei of nerve\\ncells are shrunk as much as fifty per cent by extreme fatigue.\\nReasonable fatigue followed by proper recuperation is not harmful, but\\neven necessary if the best development is to be attained; but fatigue\\nwithout proper nourishment and rest is fatal to all mental operations,\\nand indeed finally to the nervous system itself, leaving it permanently\\nin a condition of low tone, and incapable of rallying to strong effort.\\nFor rapid and complete recuperation the cells must have not only the\\nbest of nourishment but opportunity for rest as well.\\n\\nExtreme and long-continued fatigue is hostile to the development and\\nwelfare of any nervous system, and especially to that of children. Not\\nonly does overfatigue hinder growth, but it also results in the\\nformation of certain _toxins_, or poisons, in the organism, which are\\nparticularly harmful to nervous tissue. It is these fatigue toxins that\\naccount for many of the nervous and mental disorders which accompany\\nbreakdowns from overwork. On the whole, the evil effects from mental\\noverstrain are more to be feared than from physical overstrain.\\n\\nTHE EFFECTS OF WORRY.--There is, perhaps, no greater foe to brain growth\\nand efficiency than the nervous and worn-out condition which comes from\\nloss of sleep or from worry. Experiments in the psychological\\nlaboratories have shown that nerve cells shrivel up and lose their\\nvitality under loss of sleep. Let this go on for any considerable\\nlength of time, and the loss is irreparable; for the cells can never\\nrecuperate. This is especially true in the case of children or young\\npeople. Many school boys and girls, indeed many college students, are\\nmaking slow progress in their studies not because they are mentally slow\\nor inefficient, not even chiefly because they lose time that should be\\nput on their lessons, but because they are incapacitating their brains\\nfor good service through late hours and the consequent loss of sleep.\\nAdd to this condition that of worry, which often accompanies it from the\\nfact of failure in lessons, and a naturally good and well-organized\\nnervous system is sure to fail. Worry, from whatever cause, should be\\navoided as one would avoid poison, if we would bring ourselves to the\\nhighest degree of efficiency. Not only does worry temporarily unfit the\\nmind for its best work, but its evil results are permanent, since the\\nmind is left with a poorly developed or undone nervous system through\\nwhich to work, even after the cause for worry has been removed and the\\nworry itself has ceased.\\n\\nNot only should each individual seek to control the causes of worry in\\nhis own life, but the home and the school should force upon childhood as\\nfew causes for worry as may be. Children\\'s worry over fears of the dark,\\nover sickness and death, over prospective but delayed punishment, over\\nthe thousand and one real or imaginary troubles of childhood, should be\\neliminated so far as possible. School examinations that prey on the\\npeace of mind, threats of failure of promotion, all nagging and sarcasm,\\nand whatever else may cause continued pain or worry to sensitive minds\\nshould be barred from our schoolroom methods and practice. The price we\\nforce the child to pay for results through their use is too great for\\nthem to be tolerated. We must seek a better way.\\n\\nTHE FACTORS IN GOOD NUTRITION.--For the best nutrition there is\\nnecessity first of all plenty of nourishing and healthful food. Science\\nand experience have both disproved the supposition that students should\\nbe scantily fed. O\\'Shea claims that many brain workers are far short of\\ntheir highest grade of efficiency because of starving their brains from\\npoor diet. And not only must the food be of the right quality, but the\\nbody must be in good health. Little good to eat the best of food unless\\nit is being properly digested and assimilated. And little good if all\\nthe rest is as it should be, and the right amount of oxidation does not\\ngo on in the brain so as to remove the worn-out cells and make place for\\nnew ones. This warns us that pure air and a strong circulation are\\nindispensable to the best working of our brains. No doubt many students\\nwho find their work too hard for them might locate the trouble in their\\nstomachs or their lungs or the food they eat, rather than in their\\nminds.\\n\\n\\n5. PROBLEMS FOR INTROSPECTION AND OBSERVATION\\n\\n1. Estimate the mental progress made by the child during the first five\\nyears and compare with that made during the second five years of its\\nlife. To do this make a list, so far as you are able, of the\\nacquisitions of each period. What do you conclude as to the importance\\nof play and freedom in early education? Why not continue this method\\ninstead of sending the child to school?\\n\\n2. Which has the better opportunity for sensory training, the city child\\nor the country child? For social training? For motor development through\\nplay? It is said by specialists that country children are not as good\\nplayers as city children. Why should this be the case?\\n\\n3. Observe carefully some group of children for evidences of lack of\\nsensory training (Interest in sensory objects, skill in observation,\\netc.). For lack of motor training (Failure in motor control,\\nawkwardness, lack of skill in play, etc.). Do you find that general\\nmental ability seems to be correlated with sensory and motor ability, or\\nnot?\\n\\n4. What sensory training can be had from (1) geography, (2) agriculture,\\n(3) arithmetic, (4) drawing? What lines of motor training ought the\\nschool to afford, (1) in general, (2) for the hand, (3) in the grace and\\npoise of carriage or bearing, (4) in any other line? Make observation\\ntests of these points in one or more school rooms and report the\\nresults.\\n\\n5. Describe what you think must be the type of mental life of Helen\\nKeller. (Read \"The World I Live In,\" by Helen Keller.)\\n\\n6. Study groups of children for signs of deficiency in brain power from\\nlack of nutrition. From fatigue. From worry. From lack of sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nHABIT\\n\\n\\nHabit is our \"best friend or worst enemy.\" We are \"walking bundles of\\nhabits.\" Habit is the \"fly-wheel of society,\" keeping men patient and\\ndocile in the hard or disagreeable lot which some must fill. Habit is a\\n\"cable which we cannot break.\" So say the wise men. Let me know your\\nhabits of life and you have revealed your moral standards and conduct.\\nLet me discover your intellectual habits, and I understand your type of\\nmind and methods of thought. In short, our lives are largely a daily\\nround of activities dictated by our habits in this line or that. Most of\\nour movements and acts are habitual; we think as we have formed the\\nhabit of thinking; we decide as we are in the habit of deciding; we\\nsleep, or eat, or speak as we have grown into the habit of doing these\\nthings; we may even say our prayers or perform other religious exercises\\nas matters of habit. But while habit is the veriest tyrant, yet its good\\noffices far exceed the bad even in the most fruitless or depraved life.\\n\\n\\n1. THE NATURE OF HABIT\\n\\nMany people when they speak or think of habit give the term a very\\nnarrow or limited meaning. They have in mind only certain moral or\\npersonal tendencies usually spoken of as one\\'s \"habits.\" But in order to\\nunderstand habit in any thorough and complete way we must, as suggested\\nby the preceding paragraph, broaden our concept to include every\\npossible line of physical and mental activity. Habit may be defined as\\n_the tendency of the nervous system to repeat any act that has been\\nperformed once or many times_.\\n\\nTHE PHYSICAL BASIS OF HABIT.--Habit is to be explained from the\\nstandpoint of its physical basis. Habits are formed because the tissues\\nof our brains are capable of being modified by use, and of so retaining\\nthe effects of this modification that the same act is easier of\\nperformance each succeeding time. This results in the old act being\\nrepeated instead of a new one being selected, and hence the old act is\\nperpetuated.\\n\\nEven dead and inert matter obeys the same principles in this regard as\\ndoes living matter. Says M. Leon Dumont: \"Everyone knows how a garment,\\nhaving been worn a certain time, clings to the shape of the body better\\nthan when it was new; there has been a change in the tissue, and this\\nchange is a new habit of cohesion; a lock works better after having been\\nused some time; at the outset more force was required to overcome\\ncertain roughness in the mechanism. The overcoming of this resistance is\\na phenomenon of habituation. It costs less trouble to fold a paper when\\nit has been folded already. This saving of trouble is due to the\\nessential nature of habit, which brings it about that, to reproduce the\\neffect, a less amount of the outward cause is required. The sounds of a\\nviolin improve by use in the hands of an able artist, because the fibers\\nof the wood at last contract habits of vibration conformed to harmonic\\nrelations. This is what gives such inestimable value to instruments that\\nhave belonged to great masters. Water, in flowing, hollows out for\\nitself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having\\nceased to flow, it resumes when it flows again the path traced for\\nitself before. Just so, the impressions of outer objects fashion for\\nthemselves in the nervous system more and more appropriate paths, and\\nthese vital phenomena recur under similar excitements from without, when\\nthey have been interrupted for a certain time.\"[2]\\n\\nALL LIVING TISSUE PLASTIC.--What is true of inanimate matter is doubly\\ntrue of living tissue. The tissues of the human body can be molded into\\nalmost any form you choose if taken in time. A child may be placed on\\nhis feet at too early an age, and the bones of his legs form the habit\\nof remaining bent. The Flathead Indian binds a board on the skull of his\\nchild, and its head forms the habit of remaining flat on the top. Wrong\\nbodily postures produce curvature of the spine, and pernicious modes of\\ndress deform the bones of the chest. The muscles may be trained into the\\nhabit of keeping the shoulders straight or letting them droop; those of\\nthe back, to keep the body well up on the hips, or to let it sag; those\\nof locomotion, to give us a light, springy step, or to allow a shuffling\\ncarriage; those of speech, to give us a clear-cut, accurate\\narticulation, or a careless, halting one; and those of the face, to give\\nus a cheerful cast of countenance, or a glum and morose expression.\\n\\nHABIT A MODIFICATION OF BRAIN TISSUE.--But the nervous tissue is the\\nmost sensitive and easily molded of all bodily tissues. In fact, it is\\nprobable that the real _habit_ of our characteristic walk, gesture, or\\nspeech resides in the brain, rather than in the muscles which it\\ncontrols. So delicate is the organization of the brain structure and so\\nunstable its molecules, that even the perfume of the flower, which\\nassails the nose of a child, the song of a bird, which strikes his ear,\\nor the fleeting dream, which lingers but for a second in his sleep, has\\nso modified his brain that it will never again be as if these things had\\nnot been experienced. Every sensory current which runs in from the\\noutside world; every motor current which runs out to command a muscle;\\nevery thought that we think, has so modified the nerve structure through\\nwhich it acts, that a tendency remains for a like act to be repeated.\\nOur brain and nervous system is daily being molded into fixed habits of\\nacting by our thoughts and deeds, and thus becomes the automatic\\nregister of all we do.\\n\\nThe old Chinese fairy story hits upon a fundamental and vital truth.\\nThese celestials tell their children that each child is accompanied by\\nday and by night, every moment of his life, by an invisible fairy, who\\nis provided with a pencil and tablet. It is the duty of this fairy to\\nput down every deed of the child, both good and evil, in an indelible\\nrecord which will one day rise as a witness against him. So it is in\\nvery truth with our brains. The wrong act may have been performed in\\nsecret, no living being may ever know that we performed it, and a\\nmerciful Providence may forgive it; but the inexorable monitor of our\\ndeeds was all the time beside us writing the record, and the history of\\nthat act is inscribed forever in the tissues of our brain. It may be\\nrepented of bitterly in sackcloth and ashes and be discontinued, but its\\neffects can never be quite effaced; they will remain with us a handicap\\ntill our dying day, and in some critical moment in a great emergency we\\nshall be in danger of defeat from that long past and forgotten act.\\n\\nWE MUST FORM HABITS.--We _must_, then, form habits. It is not at all in\\nour power to say whether we will form habits or not; for, once started,\\nthey go on forming themselves by day and night, steadily and\\nrelentlessly. Habit is, therefore, one of the great factors to be\\nreckoned with in our lives, and the question becomes not, Shall we form\\nhabits? but _What habits we shall form._ And we have the determining of\\nthis question largely in our own power, for habits do not just happen,\\nnor do they come to us ready made. We ourselves make them from day to\\nday through the acts we perform, and in so far as we have control over\\nour acts, in that far we can determine our habits.\\n\\n\\n2. THE PLACE OF HABIT IN THE ECONOMY OF OUR LIVES\\n\\nHabit is one of nature\\'s methods of economizing time and effort, while\\nat the same time securing greater skill and efficiency. This is easily\\nseen when it is remembered that habit tends towards _automatic_ action;\\nthat is, towards action governed by the lower nerve centers and taking\\ncare of itself, so to speak, without the interference of consciousness.\\nEveryone has observed how much easier in the performance and more\\nskillful in its execution is the act, be it playing a piano, painting a\\npicture, or driving a nail, when the movements involved have ceased to\\nbe consciously directed and become automatic.\\n\\nHABIT INCREASES SKILL AND EFFICIENCY.--Practically all increase in\\nskill, whether physical or mental, depends on our ability to form\\nhabits. Habit holds fast to the skill already attained while practice or\\nintelligence makes ready for the next step in advance. Could we not form\\nhabits we should improve but little in our way of doing things, no\\nmatter how many times we did them over. We should now be obliged to go\\nthrough the same bungling process of dressing ourselves as when we\\nfirst learned it as children. Our writing would proceed as awkwardly in\\nthe high school as the primary, our eating as adults would be as messy\\nand wide of the mark as when we were infants, and we should miss in a\\nthousand ways the motor skill that now seems so easy and natural. All\\nhighly skilled occupations, and those demanding great manual dexterity,\\nlikewise depend on our habit-forming power for the accurate and\\nautomatic movements required.\\n\\nSo with mental skill. A great portion of the fundamentals of our\\neducation must be made automatic--must become matters of habit. We set\\nout to learn the symbols of speech. We hear words and see them on the\\nprinted page; associated with these words are meanings, or ideas. Habit\\nbinds the word and the idea together, so that to think of the one is to\\ncall up the other--and language is learned. We must learn numbers, so we\\npractice the \"combinations,\" and with 4×6, or 3×8 we associate 24. Habit\\nsecures this association in our minds, and lo! we soon know our\\n\"tables.\" And so on throughout the whole range of our learning. We learn\\ncertain symbols, or facts, or processes, and habit takes hold and\\nrenders these automatic so that we can use them freely, easily, and with\\nskill, leaving our thought free for matters that cannot be made\\nautomatic. One of our greatest dangers is that we shall not make\\nsufficiently automatic, enough of the necessary foundation material of\\neducation. Failing in this, we shall at best be but blunderers\\nintellectually, handicapped because we failed to make proper use of\\nhabit in our development.\\n\\nFor, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, there is a limit to our\\nmental energy and also to the number of objects to which we are able to\\nattend. It is only when attention has been freed from the many things\\nthat can always be thought or done _in the same way_, that the mind can\\ndevote itself to the real problems that require judgment, imagination or\\nreasoning. The writer whose spelling and punctuation do not take care of\\nthemselves will hardly make a success of writing. The mathematician\\nwhose number combinations, processes and formulæ are not automatic in\\nhis mind can never hope to make progress in mathematical thinking. The\\nspeaker who, while speaking, has to think of his gestures, his voice or\\nhis enunciation will never sway audiences by his logic or his eloquence.\\n\\nHABIT SAVES EFFORT AND FATIGUE.--We do most easily and with least\\nfatigue that which we are accustomed to do. It is the new act or the\\nstrange task that tires us. The horse that is used to the farm wearies\\nif put on the road, while the roadster tires easily when hitched to the\\nplow. The experienced penman works all day at his desk without undue\\nfatigue, while the man more accustomed to the pick and the shovel than\\nto the pen, is exhausted by a half hour\\'s writing at a letter. Those who\\nfollow a sedentary and inactive occupation do not tire by much sitting,\\nwhile children or others used to freedom and action may find it a\\nwearisome task merely to remain still for an hour or two.\\n\\nNot only would the skill and speed demanded by modern industry be\\nimpossible without the aid of habit, but without its help none could\\nstand the fatigue and strain. The new workman placed at a high-speed\\nmachine is ready to fall from weariness at the end of his first day. But\\nlittle by little he learns to omit the unnecessary movements, the\\nnecessary movements become easier and more automatic through habit, and\\nhe finds the work easier. We may conclude, then, that not only do\\nconsciously directed movements show less skill than the same movements\\nmade automatic by habit, but they also require more effort and produce\\ngreater fatigue.\\n\\nHABIT ECONOMIZES MORAL EFFORT.--To have to decide each time the question\\ncomes up whether we will attend to this lecture or sermon or lesson;\\nwhether we will persevere and go through this piece of disagreeable work\\nwhich we have begun; whether we will go to the trouble of being\\ncourteous and kind to this or that poor or unlovely or dirty\\nfellow-mortal; whether we will take this road because it looks easy, or\\nthat one because we know it to be the one we ought to take; whether we\\nwill be strictly fair and honest when we might just as well be the\\nopposite; whether we will resist the temptation which dares us; whether\\nwe will do this duty, hard though it is, which confronts us--to have to\\ndecide each of these questions every time it presents itself is to put\\ntoo large a proportion of our thought and energy on things which should\\ntake care of themselves. For all these things should early become so\\nnearly habitual that they can be settled with the very minimum of\\nexpenditure of energy when they arise.\\n\\nTHE HABIT OF ATTENTION.--It is a noble thing to be able to attend by\\nsheer force of will when the interest lags, or some more attractive\\nthing appears, but far better is it so to have formed the habit of\\nattention that we naturally fall into that attitude when this is the\\ndesirable thing. To understand what I mean, you only have to look over a\\nclass or an audience and note the different ways which people have of\\nfinally settling down to listening. Some with an attitude which says,\\n\"Now here I am, ready to listen to you if you will interest me,\\notherwise not.\" Others with a manner which says, \"I did not really come\\nhere expecting to listen, and you will have a large task if you\\ninterest me; I never listen unless I am compelled to, and the\\nresponsibility rests on you.\" Others plainly say, \"I really mean to\\nlisten, but I have hard work to control my thoughts, and if I wander I\\nshall not blame you altogether; it is just my way.\" And still others\\nsay, \"When I am expected to listen, I always listen whether there is\\nanything much to listen to or not. I have formed that habit, and so have\\nno quarrel with myself about it. You can depend on me to be attentive,\\nfor I cannot afford to weaken my habit of attention whether you do well\\nor not.\" Every speaker will clasp these last listeners to his heart and\\nfeed them on the choicest thoughts of his soul; they are the ones to\\nwhom he speaks and to whom his address will appeal.\\n\\nHABIT ENABLES US TO MEET THE DISAGREEABLE.--To be able to persevere in\\nthe face of difficulties and hardships and carry through the\\ndisagreeable thing in spite of the protests of our natures against the\\nsacrifice which it requires, is a creditable thing; but it is more\\ncreditable to have so formed the habit of perseverance that the\\ndisagreeable duty shall be done without a struggle, or protest, or\\nquestion. Horace Mann testifies of himself that whatever success he was\\nable to attain was made possible through the early habit which he formed\\nof never stopping to inquire whether he _liked_ to do a thing which\\nneeded doing, but of doing everything equally well and without question,\\nboth the pleasant and the unpleasant.\\n\\nThe youth who can fight out a moral battle and win against the\\nallurements of some attractive temptation is worthy the highest honor\\nand praise; but so long as he has to fight the same battle over and over\\nagain, he is on dangerous ground morally. For good morals must finally\\nbecome habits, so ingrained in us that the right decision comes largely\\nwithout effort and without struggle. Otherwise the strain is too great,\\nand defeat will occasionally come; and defeat means weakness and at last\\ndisaster, after the spirit has tired of the constant conflict. And so on\\nin a hundred lines. Good habits are more to be coveted than individual\\nvictories in special cases, much as these are to be desired. For good\\nhabits mean victories all along the line.\\n\\nHABIT THE FOUNDATION OF PERSONALITY.--The biologist tells us that it is\\nthe _constant_ and not the _occasional_ in the environment that\\nimpresses itself on an organism. So also it is the _habitual_ in our\\nlives that builds itself into our character and personality. In a very\\nreal sense we _are_ what we are in the habit of doing and thinking.\\n\\nWithout habit, personality could not exist; for we could never do a\\nthing twice alike, and hence would be a new person each succeeding\\nmoment. The acts which give us our own peculiar individuality are our\\nhabitual acts--the little things that do themselves moment by moment\\nwithout care or attention, and are the truest and best expression of our\\nreal selves. Probably no one of us could be very sure which arm he puts\\ninto the sleeve, or which foot he puts into the shoe, first; and yet\\neach of us certainly formed the habit long ago of doing these things in\\na certain way. We might not be able to describe just how we hold knife\\nand fork and spoon, and yet each has his own characteristic and habitual\\nway of handling them. We sit down and get up in some characteristic way,\\nand the very poise of our heads and attitudes of our bodies are the\\nresult of habit. We get sleepy and wake up, become hungry and thirsty at\\ncertain hours, through force of habit. We form the habit of liking a\\ncertain chair, or nook, or corner, or path, or desk, and then seek this\\nto the exclusion of all others. We habitually use a particular pitch of\\nvoice and type of enunciation in speaking, and this becomes one of our\\ncharacteristic marks; or we form the habit of using barbarisms or\\nsolecisms of language in youth, and these cling to us and become an\\ninseparable part of us later in life.\\n\\nOn the mental side the case is no different. Our thinking is as\\ncharacteristic as our physical acts. We may form the habit of thinking\\nthings out logically, or of jumping to conclusions; of thinking\\ncritically and independently, or of taking things unquestioningly on the\\nauthority of others. We may form the habit of carefully reading good,\\nsensible books, or of skimming sentimental and trashy ones; of choosing\\nelevating, ennobling companions, or the opposite; of being a good\\nconversationalist and doing our part in a social group, or of being a\\ndrag on the conversation, and needing to be \"entertained.\" We may form\\nthe habit of observing the things about us and enjoying the beautiful in\\nour environment, or of failing to observe or to enjoy. We may form the\\nhabit of obeying the voice of conscience or of weakly yielding to\\ntemptation without a struggle; of taking a reverent attitude of prayer\\nin our devotions, or of merely saying our prayers.\\n\\nHABIT SAVES WORRY AND REBELLION.--Habit has been called the \"balance\\nwheel\" of society. This is because men readily become habituated to the\\nhard, the disagreeable, or the inevitable, and cease to battle against\\nit. A lot that at first seems unendurable after a time causes less\\nrevolt. A sorrow that seems too poignant to be borne in the course of\\ntime loses some of its sharpness. Oppression or injustice that arouses\\nthe fiercest resentment and hate may finally come to be accepted with\\nresignation. Habit helps us learn that \"what cannot be cured must be\\nendured.\"\\n\\n\\n3. THE TYRANNY OF HABIT\\n\\nEVEN GOOD HABITS NEED TO BE MODIFIED.--But even in good habits there is\\ndanger. Habit is the opposite of attention. Habit relieves attention of\\nunnecessary strain. Every habitual act was at one time, either in the\\nhistory of the race or of the individual, a voluntary act; that is, it\\nwas performed under active attention. As the habit grew, attention was\\ngradually rendered unnecessary, until finally it dropped entirely out.\\nAnd herein lies the danger. Habit once formed has no way of being\\nmodified unless in some way attention is called to it, for a habit left\\nto itself becomes more and more firmly fixed. The rut grows deeper. In\\nvery few, if any, of our actions can we afford to have this the case.\\nOur habits need to be progressive, they need to grow, to be modified, to\\nbe improved. Otherwise they will become an incrusting shell, fixed and\\nunyielding, which will limit our growth.\\n\\nIt is necessary, then, to keep our habitual acts under some surveillance\\nof attention, to pass them in review for inspection every now and then,\\nthat we may discover possible modifications which will make them more\\nserviceable. We need to be inventive, constantly to find out better ways\\nof doing things. Habit takes care of our standing, walking, sitting; but\\nhow many of us could not improve his poise and carriage if he would? Our\\nspeech has become largely automatic, but no doubt all of us might remove\\nfaults of enunciation, pronunciation or stress from our speaking. So\\nalso we might better our habits of study and thinking, our methods of\\nmemorizing, or our manner of attending.\\n\\nTHE TENDENCY OF \"RUTS.\"--But this will require something of heroism. For\\nto follow the well-beaten path of custom is easy and pleasant, while to\\nbreak out of the rut of habit and start a new line of action is\\ndifficult and disturbing. Most people prefer to keep doing things as\\nthey always have done them, to continue reading and thinking and\\nbelieving as they have long been in the habit of doing, not so much\\nbecause they feel that their way is best, but because it is easier than\\nto change. Hence the great mass of us settle down on the plane of\\nmediocrity, and become \"old fogy.\" We learn to do things passably well,\\ncease to think about improving our ways of doing them, and so fall into\\na rut. Only the few go on. They make use of habit as the rest do, but\\nthey also continue to attend at critical points of action, and so make\\nhabit an _ally_ in place of accepting it as a _tyrant_.\\n\\n\\n4. HABIT-FORMING A PART OF EDUCATION\\n\\nIt follows from the importance of habit in our lives that no small part\\nof education should be concerned with the development of serviceable\\nhabits. Says James, \"Could the young but realize how soon they will\\nbecome mere walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed to\\ntheir conduct while in the plastic state. We are spinning our own fates,\\ngood or evil, and never to be undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or\\nof vice leaves its never-so-little scar.\" Any youth who is forming a\\nlarge number of useful habits is receiving no mean education, no matter\\nif his knowledge of books may be limited; on the other hand, no one who\\nis forming a large number of bad habits is being well educated, no\\nmatter how brilliant his knowledge may be.\\n\\nYOUTH THE TIME FOR HABIT-FORMING.--Childhood and youth is the great time\\nfor habit-forming. Then the brain is plastic and easily molded, and it\\nretains its impressions more indelibly; later it is hard to modify, and\\nthe impressions made are less permanent. It is hard to teach an old dog\\nnew tricks; nor would he remember them if you could teach them to him,\\nnor be able to perform them well even if he could remember them. The\\nyoung child will, within the first few weeks of its life, form habits of\\nsleeping and feeding. It may in a few days be led into the habit of\\nsleeping in the dark, or requiring a light; of going to sleep lying\\nquietly, or of insisting upon being rocked; of getting hungry by the\\nclock, or of wanting its food at all times when it finds nothing else to\\ndo, and so on. It is wholly outside the power of the mother or the nurse\\nto determine whether the child shall form habits, but largely within\\ntheir power to say what habits shall be formed, since they control his\\nacts.\\n\\nAs the child grows older, the range of his habits increases; and by the\\ntime he has reached his middle teens, the greater number of his personal\\nhabits are formed. It is very doubtful whether a boy who has not formed\\nhabits of punctuality before the age of fifteen will ever be entirely\\ntrustworthy in matters requiring precision in this line. The girl who\\nhas not, before this age, formed habits of neatness and order will\\nhardly make a tidy housekeeper later in her life. Those who in youth\\nhave no opportunity to habituate themselves to the usages of society may\\nstudy books on etiquette and employ private instructors in the art of\\npolite behavior all they please later in life, but they will never cease\\nto be awkward and ill at ease. None are at a greater disadvantage than\\nthe suddenly-grown-rich who attempt late in life to surround themselves\\nwith articles of art and luxury, though their habits were all formed\\namid barrenness and want during their earlier years.\\n\\nTHE HABIT OF ACHIEVEMENT.--What youth does not dream of being great, or\\nnoble, or a celebrated scholar! And how few there are who finally\\nachieve their ideals! Where does the cause of failure lie? Surely not in\\nthe lack of high ideals. Multitudes of young people have \"Excelsior!\" as\\ntheir motto, and yet never get started up the mountain slope, let alone\\ntoiling on to its top. They have put in hours dreaming of the glory\\nfarther up, _and have never begun to climb_. The difficulty comes in not\\nrealizing that the only way to become what we wish or dream that we may\\nbecome is _to form the habit of being that thing_. To form the habit of\\nachievement, of effort, of self-sacrifice, if need be. To form the habit\\nof deeds along with dreams; to form the habit of _doing_.\\n\\nWho of us has not at this moment lying in wait for his convenience in\\nthe dim future a number of things which he means to do just as soon as\\nthis term of school is finished, or this job of work is completed, or\\nwhen he is not so busy as now? And how seldom does he ever get at these\\nthings at all! Darwin tells that in his youth he loved poetry, art, and\\nmusic, but was so busy with his scientific work that he could ill spare\\nthe time to indulge these tastes. So he promised himself that he would\\ndevote his time to scientific work and make his mark in this. Then he\\nwould have time for the things that he loved, and would cultivate his\\ntaste for the fine arts. He made his mark in the field of science, and\\nthen turned again to poetry, to music, to art. But alas! they were all\\ndead and dry bones to him, without life or interest. He had passed the\\ntime when he could ever form the taste for them. He had formed his\\nhabits in another direction, and now it was forever too late to form new\\nhabits. His own conclusion is, that if he had his life to live over\\nagain, he would each week listen to some musical concert and visit some\\nart gallery, and that each day he would read some poetry, and thereby\\nkeep alive and active the love for them.\\n\\nSo every school and home should be a species of habit-factory--a place\\nwhere children develop habits of neatness, punctuality, obedience,\\npoliteness, dependability and the other graces of character.\\n\\n\\n5. RULES FOR HABIT-FORMING\\n\\nJAMES\\'S THREE MAXIMS FOR HABIT-FORMING.--On the forming of new habits\\nand the leaving off of old ones, I know of no better statement than that\\nof James, based on Bain\\'s chapter on \"Moral Habits.\" I quote this\\nstatement at some length: \"In the acquisition of a new habit, or the\\nleaving off of an old one, we must take care to _launch ourselves with\\nas strong and decided an initiative as possible_. Accumulate all the\\npossible circumstances which shall reënforce right motives; put yourself\\nassiduously in conditions that encourage the new way; make engagements\\nincompatible with the old; take a public pledge, if the case allows; in\\nshort, develop your resolution with every aid you know. This will give\\nyour new beginning such a momentum that the temptation to break down\\nwill not occur as soon as it otherwise might; and every day during which\\na breakdown is postponed adds to the chances of its not occurring at\\nall.\\n\\n\"The second maxim is: _Never suffer an exception to occur until the new\\nhabit is securely rooted in your life._ Each lapse is like letting fall\\na ball of string which one is carefully winding up; a single slip undoes\\nmore than a great many turns will wind again. _Continuity_ of training\\nis the great means of making the nervous system act infallibly right....\\nThe need of securing success nerves one to future vigor.\\n\\n\"A third maxim may be added to the preceding pair: _Seize the very first\\npossible opportunity to act on every resolution you make, and on every\\nemotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits\\nyou aspire to gain._ It is not in the moment of their forming, but in\\nthe moment of their producing _motor effects_, that resolves and\\naspirations communicate the new \\'set\\' to the brain.\"[3]\\n\\nTHE PREPONDERANCE OF GOOD HABITS OVER BAD.--And finally, let no one be\\ndisturbed or afraid because in a little time you become a \"walking\\nbundle of habits.\" For in so far as your good actions predominate over\\nyour bad ones, that much will your good habits outweigh your bad habits.\\nSilently, moment by moment, efficiency is growing out of all worthy acts\\nwell done. Every bit of heroic self-sacrifice, every battle fought and\\nwon, every good deed performed, is being irradicably credited to you in\\nyour nervous system, and will finally add its mite toward achieving the\\nsuccess of your ambitions.\\n\\n\\n6. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Select some act which you have recently begun to perform and watch it\\ngrow more and more habitual. Notice carefully for a week and see whether\\nyou do not discover some habits which you did not know you had. Make a\\ncatalog of your bad habits; of the most important of your good ones.\\n\\n2. Set out to form some new habits which you desire to possess; also to\\nbreak some undesirable habit, watching carefully what takes place in\\nboth cases, and how long it requires.\\n\\n3. Try the following experiment and relate the results to the matter of\\nautomatic control brought about by habit: Draw a star on a sheet of\\ncardboard. Place this on a table before you, with a hand-mirror so\\narranged that you can see the star in the mirror. Now trace the outline\\nof the star with a pencil, looking steadily in the mirror to guide your\\nhand. Do not lift the pencil from the paper from the time you start\\nuntil you finish. Have others try this experiment.\\n\\n4. Study some group of pupils for their habits (1) of attention, (2) of\\nspeech, (3) of standing, sitting, and walking, (4) of study. Report on\\nyour observations and suggest methods of curing bad habits observed.\\n\\n5. Make a list of \"mannerisms\" you have observed, and suggest how they\\nmay be cured.\\n\\n6. Make a list of from ten to twenty habits which you think the school\\nand its work should especially cultivate. What ones of these are the\\nschools you know least successful in cultivating? Where does the trouble\\nlie?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nSENSATION\\n\\n\\nWe can best understand the problems of sensation and perception if we\\nfirst think of the existence of two great worlds--the world of physical\\nnature without and the world of mind within. On the one hand is our\\nmaterial environment, the things we see and hear and touch and taste and\\nhandle; and on the other hand our consciousness, the means by which we\\ncome to know this outer world and adjust ourselves to it. These two\\nworlds seem in a sense to belong to and require each other. For what\\nwould be the meaning or use of the physical world with no mind to know\\nor use it; and what would be the use of a mind with nothing to be known\\nor thought about?\\n\\n\\n1. HOW WE COME TO KNOW THE EXTERNAL WORLD\\n\\nThere is a marvel about our coming to know the external world which we\\nshall never be able fully to understand. We have come by this knowledge\\nso gradually and unconsciously that it now appears to us as commonplace,\\nand we take for granted many things that it would puzzle us to explain.\\n\\nKNOWLEDGE THROUGH THE SENSES.--For example, we say, \"Of course I see\\nyonder green tree: it is about ten rods distant.\" But why \"of course\"?\\nWhy should objects at a distance from us and with no evident connection\\nbetween us and them be known to us at all merely by turning our eyes in\\ntheir direction when there is light? Why not rather say with the blind\\nson of Professor Puiseaux of Paris, who, when asked if he would like to\\nbe restored to sight, answered: \"If it were not for curiosity I would\\nrather have long arms. It seems to me that my hands would teach me\\nbetter what is passing in the moon than your eyes or telescopes.\"\\n\\nWe listen and then say, \"Yes, that is a certain bell ringing in the\\nneighboring village,\" as if this were the most simple thing in the\\nworld. But why should one piece of metal striking against another a mile\\nor two away make us aware that there is a bell there at all, let alone\\nthat it is a certain bell whose tone we recognize? Or we pass our\\nfingers over a piece of cloth and decide, \"That is silk.\" But why,\\nmerely by placing our skin in contact with a bit of material, should we\\nbe able to know its quality, much less that it is cloth and that its\\nthreads were originally spun by an insect? Or we take a sip of liquid\\nand say, \"This milk is sour.\" But why should we be able by taking the\\nliquid into the mouth and bringing it into contact with the mucous\\nmembrane to tell that it is milk, and that it possesses the quality\\nwhich we call _sour_? Or, once more, we get a whiff of air through the\\nopen window in the springtime and say, \"There is a lilac bush in bloom\\non the lawn.\" Yet why, from inhaling air containing particles of lilac,\\nshould we be able to know that there is anything outside, much less that\\nit is a flower and of a particular variety which we call lilac? Or,\\nfinally, we hold a heated flatiron up near the cheek and say, \"This is\\ntoo hot! it will burn the cloth.\" But why by holding this object a foot\\naway from the face do we know that it is there, let alone knowing its\\ntemperature?\\n\\nTHE UNITY OF SENSORY EXPERIENCE.--Further, our senses come through\\nexperience to have the power of fusing, or combining their knowledge, so\\nto speak, by which each expresses its knowledge in terms of the others.\\nThus we take a glance out of the window and say that the day looks cold,\\nalthough we well know that we cannot see _cold_. Or we say that the\\nmelon sounds green, or the bell sounds cracked, although a _crack_ or\\n_greenness_ cannot be heard. Or we say that the box feels empty,\\nalthough _emptiness_ cannot be felt. We have come to associate cold,\\noriginally experienced with days which look like the one we now see,\\nwith this particular appearance, and so we say we see the cold; sounds\\nlike the one coming from the bell we have come to associate with cracked\\nbells, and that coming from the melon with green melons, until we say\\nunhesitatingly that the bell sounds cracked and the melon sounds green.\\nAnd so with the various senses. Each gleans from the world its own\\nparticular bit of knowledge, but all are finally in a partnership and\\nwhat is each one\\'s knowledge belongs to every other one in so far as the\\nother can use it.\\n\\nTHE SENSORY PROCESSES TO BE EXPLAINED.--The explanation of the ultimate\\nnature of knowledge, and how we reach it through contact with our\\nmaterial environment, we will leave to the philosophers. And battles\\nenough they have over the question, and still others they will have\\nbefore the matter is settled. The easier and more important problem for\\nus is to describe the _processes_ by which the mind comes to know its\\nenvironment, and to see how it uses this knowledge in thinking. This\\nmuch we shall be able to do, for it is often possible to describe a\\nprocess and discover its laws even when we cannot fully explain its\\nnature and origin. We know the process of digestion and assimilation,\\nand the laws which govern them, although we do not understand the\\nultimate nature and origin of _life_ which makes these possible.\\n\\nTHE QUALITIES OF OBJECTS EXIST IN THE MIND.--Yet even in the relatively\\nsimple description which we have proposed many puzzles confront us, and\\none of them appears at the very outset. This is that the qualities which\\nwe usually ascribe to objects really exist in our own minds and not in\\nthe objects at all. Take, for instance, the common qualities of light\\nand color. The physicist tells us that what we see as light is\\noccasioned by an incredibly rapid beating of ether waves on the retina\\nof the eye. All space is filled with this ether; and when it is\\nlight--that is, when some object like the sun or other light-giving body\\nis present--the ether is set in motion by the vibrating molecules of the\\nbody which is the source of light, its waves strike the retina, a\\ncurrent is produced and carried to the brain, and we see light. This\\nmeans, then, that space, the medium in which we see objects, is not\\nfilled with light (the sensation), but with very rapid waves of ether,\\nand that the light which we see really occurs in our own minds as the\\nmental response to the physical stimulus of ether waves. Likewise with\\ncolor. Color is produced by ether waves of different lengths and degrees\\nof rapidity.\\n\\nThus ether waves at the rate of 450 billions a second give us the\\nsensation of red; of 472 billions a second, orange; of 526 billions a\\nsecond, yellow; of 589 billions a second, green; of 640 billions a\\nsecond, blue; of 722 billions a second, indigo; of 790 billions a\\nsecond, violet. What exists outside of us, then, is these ether waves of\\ndifferent rates, and not the colors (as sensations) themselves. The\\nbeautiful yellow and crimson of a sunset, the variegated colors of a\\nlandscape, the delicate pink in the cheek of a child, the blush of a\\nrose, the shimmering green of the lake--these reside not in the objects\\nthemselves, but in the consciousness of the one who sees them. The\\nobjects possess but the quality of reflecting back to the eye ether\\nwaves of the particular rate corresponding to the color which we ascribe\\nto them. Thus \"red\" objects, and no others, reflect back ether waves of\\na rate of 450 billions a second: \"white\" objects reflect all rates;\\n\"black\" objects reflect none.\\n\\nThe case is no different with regard to sound. When we speak of a sound\\ncoming from a bell, what we really mean is that the vibrations of the\\nbell have set up waves in the air between it and our ear, which have\\nproduced corresponding vibrations in the ear; that a nerve current was\\nthereby produced; and that a sound was heard. But the sound (i.e.,\\nsensation) is a mental thing, and exists only in our own consciousness.\\nWhat passed between the sounding object and ourselves was waves in the\\nintervening air, ready to be translated through the machinery of nerves\\nand brain into the beautiful tones and melodies and harmonies of the\\nmind. And so with all other sensations.\\n\\nTHE THREE SETS OF FACTORS.--What exists outside of us therefore is a\\n_stimulus_, some form of physical energy, of a kind suitable to excite\\nto activity a certain end-organ of taste, or touch, or smell, or sight,\\nor hearing; what exists within us is the _nervous machinery_ capable of\\nconverting this stimulus into a nerve current which shall produce an\\nactivity in the cortex of the brain; what results is the _mental object_\\nwhich we call a _sensation_ of taste, smell, touch, sight, or hearing.\\n\\n\\n2. THE NATURE OF SENSATION\\n\\nSENSATION GIVES US OUR WORLD OF QUALITIES.--In actual experience\\nsensations are never known apart from the objects to which they belong.\\nThis is to say that when we see _yellow_ or _red_ it is always in\\nconnection with some surface, or object; when we taste _sour_, this\\nquality belongs to some substance, and so on with all the senses. Yet by\\nsensation we mean only _the simple qualities of objects known in\\nconsciousness as the result of appropriate stimuli applied to\\nend-organs_. We shall later see how by perception these qualities fuse\\nor combine to form objects, but in the present chapter we shall be\\nconcerned with the qualities only. Sensations are, then, the simplest\\nand most elementary knowledge we may get from the physical world,--the\\nred, the blue, the bitter, the cold, the fragrant, and whatever other\\nqualities may belong to the external world. We shall not for the present\\nbe concerned with the objects or sources from which the qualities may\\ncome.\\n\\nTo quote James on the meaning of sensation: \"All we can say on this\\npoint is that _what we mean by sensations are first things in the way of\\nconsciousness_. They are the _immediate_ results upon consciousness of\\nnerve currents as they enter the brain, and before they have awakened\\nany suggestions or associations with past experience. But it is obvious\\nthat _such immediate sensations can be realized only in the earliest\\ndays of life_.\"\\n\\nTHE ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION.--Sensations differ from each other in at\\nleast four respects; namely, _quality_, _intensity_, _extensity_, and\\n_duration_.\\n\\nIt is a difference in _quality_ that makes us say, \"This paper is red,\\nand that, blue; this liquid is sweet, and that, sour.\" Differences in\\nquality are therefore fundamental differences in _kind_. Besides the\\nquality-differences that exist within the same general field, as of\\ntaste or vision, it is evident that there is a still more fundamental\\ndifference existing between the various fields. One can, for example,\\ncompare red with blue or sweet with sour, and tell which quality he\\nprefers. But let him try to compare red with sweet, or blue with sour,\\nand the quality-difference is so profound that there seems to be no\\nbasis for comparison.\\n\\nDifferences in _intensity_ of sensation are familiar to every person who\\nprefers two lumps of sugar rather than one lump in his coffee; the sweet\\nis of the same quality in either case, but differs in intensity. In\\nevery field of sensation, the intensity may proceed from the smallest\\namount to the greatest amount discernible. In general, the intensity of\\nthe sensation depends on the intensity of the stimulus, though the\\ncondition of the sense-organ as regards fatigue or adaptation to the\\nstimulus has its effect. It is obvious that a stimulus may be too weak\\nto produce any sensation; as, for example, a few grains of sugar in a\\ncup of coffee or a few drops of lemon in a quart of water could not be\\ndetected. It is also true that the intensity of the stimulus may be so\\ngreat that an increase in intensity produces no effect on the sensation;\\nas, for example, the addition of sugar to a solution of saccharine would\\nnot noticeably increase its sweetness. The lowest and highest intensity\\npoints of sensation are called the lower and upper _limen_, or\\nthreshold, respectively.\\n\\nBy _extensity_ is meant the space-differences of sensations. The touch\\nof the point of a toothpick on the skin has a different space quality\\nfrom the touch of the flat end of a pencil. Low tones seem to have more\\nvolume than high tones. Some pains feel sharp and others dull and\\ndiffuse. The warmth felt from spreading the palms of the hands out to\\nthe fire has a \"bigness\" not felt from heating one solitary finger. The\\nextensity of a sensation depends on the number of nerve endings\\nstimulated.\\n\\nThe _duration_ of a sensation refers to the time it lasts. This must not\\nbe confused with the duration of the stimulus, which may be either\\nlonger or shorter than the duration of the sensation. Every sensation\\nmust exist for some space of time, long or short, or it would have no\\npart in consciousness.\\n\\n\\n3. SENSORY QUALITIES AND THEIR END-ORGANS\\n\\nAll are familiar with the \"five senses\" of our elementary physiologies,\\nsight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. A more complete study of\\nsensation reveals nearly three times this number, however. This is to\\nsay that the body is equipped with more than a dozen different kinds of\\nend-organs, each prepared to receive its own particular type of\\nstimulus. It must also be understood that some of the end-organs yield\\nmore than one sense. The eye, for example, gives not only visual but\\nmuscular sensations; the ear not only auditory, but tactual; the tongue\\nnot only gustatory, but tactual and cold and warmth sensations.\\n\\nSIGHT.--Vision is a _distance_ sense; we can see afar off. The stimulus\\nis _chemical_ in its action; this means that the ether waves, on\\nstriking the retina, cause a chemical change which sets up the nerve\\ncurrent responsible for the sensation.\\n\\nThe eye, whose general structure is sufficiently described in all\\nstandard physiologies, consists of a visual apparatus designed to bring\\nthe images of objects to a clear focus on the retina at the _fovea_, or\\narea of clearest vision, near the point of entrance of the optic nerve.\\n\\nThe sensation of sight coming from this retinal image unaided by other\\nsensations gives us but two qualities, _light and color_. The eye can\\ndistinguish many different grades of light from purest white on through\\nthe various grays to densest black. The range is greater still in color.\\nWe speak of the seven colors of the spectrum, violet, indigo, blue,\\ngreen, yellow, orange, and red. But this is not a very serviceable\\nclassification, since the average eye can distinguish about 35,000 color\\neffects. It is also somewhat bewildering to find that all these colors\\nseem to be produced from the four fundamental hues, red, green, yellow,\\nand blue, plus the various tints. These four, combined in varying\\nproportions and with different degrees of light (i.e., different shades\\nof gray), yield all the color effects known to the human eye. Herschel\\nestimates that the workers on the mosaics at Rome must have\\ndistinguished 30,000 different color tones. The _hue_ of a color refers\\nto its fundamental quality, as red or yellow; the _chroma_, to its\\nsaturation, or the strength of the color; and the _tint,_ to the amount\\nof brightness (i.e., white) it contains.\\n\\nHEARING.--Hearing is also a distance sense. The action of its stimulus\\nis mechanical, which is to say that the vibrations produced in the air\\nby the sounding body are finally transmitted by the mechanism of the\\nmiddle ear to the inner ear. Here the impulse is conveyed through the\\nliquid of the internal ear to the nerve endings as so many tiny blows,\\nwhich produce the nerve current carried to the brain by the auditory\\nnerve.\\n\\nThe sensation of hearing, like that of sight, gives us two qualities:\\nnamely, _tones_ with their accompanying pitch and timbre, and _noises_.\\nTones, or musical sounds, are produced by isochronous or equal-timed\\nvibrations; thus _C_ of the first octave is produced by 256 vibrations a\\nsecond, and if this tone is prolonged the vibration rate will continue\\nuniformly the same. Noises, on the other hand, are produced by\\nvibrations which have no uniformity of vibration rate. The ear\\'s\\nsensibility to pitch extends over about seven octaves. The seven-octave\\npiano goes down to 27-1/2 vibrations and reaches up to 3,500 vibrations.\\nNotes of nearly 50,000 vibrations can be heard by an average ear,\\nhowever, though these are too painfully shrill to be musical. Taking\\ninto account this upper limit, the range of the ear is about eleven\\noctaves. The ear, having given us _loudness_ of tones, which depends on\\nthe amplitude of the vibrations, _pitch_, which depends on the rapidity\\nof the vibrations, and _timbre_, or _quality_, which depends on the\\ncomplexity of the vibrations, has no further qualities of sound to\\nreveal.\\n\\nTASTE.--The sense of taste is located chiefly in the tongue, over the\\nsurface of which are scattered many minute _taste-bulbs_. These can be\\nseen as small red specks, most plentifully distributed along the edges\\nand at the tip of the tongue. The substance tasted must be in\\n_solution_, and come in contact with the nerve endings. The action of\\nthe stimulus is _chemical_.\\n\\nThe sense of taste recognizes the four qualities of _sour_, _sweet_,\\n_salt_, and _bitter_. Many of the qualities which we improperly call\\ntastes are in reality a complex of taste, smell, touch, and temperature.\\nSmell contributes so largely to the sense of taste that many articles of\\nfood become \"tasteless\" when we have a catarrh, and many nauseating\\ndoses of medicine can be taken without discomfort if the nose is held.\\nProbably none of us, if we are careful to exclude all odors by plugging\\nthe nostrils with cotton, can by taste distinguish between scraped\\napple, potato, turnip, or beet, or can tell hot milk from tea or coffee\\nof the same temperature.\\n\\nSMELL.--In the upper part of the nasal cavity lies a small brownish\\npatch of mucous membrane. It is here that the olfactory nerve endings\\nare located. The substance smelled must be volatile, that is, must exist\\nin gaseous form, and come in direct contact with the nerve endings.\\nChemical action results in a nerve current.\\n\\nThe sensations of smell have not been classified so well as those of\\ntaste, and we have no distinct names for them. Neither do we know how\\nmany olfactory qualities the sense of smell is capable of revealing. The\\nonly definite classification of smell qualities is that based on their\\npleasantness or the opposite. We also borrow a few terms and speak of\\n_sweet_ or _fragrant_ odors and _fresh_ or _close_ smells. There is some\\nevidence when we observe animals, or even primitive men, that the human\\nrace has been evolving greater sensibility to certain odors, while at\\nthe same time there has been a loss of keenness of what we call scent.\\n\\nVARIOUS SENSATIONS FROM THE SKIN.--The skin, besides being a protective\\nand excretory organ, affords a lodging-place for the end-organs giving\\nus our sense of pressure, pain, cold, warmth, tickle, and itch.\\n_Pressure_ seems to have for its end-organ the _hair-bulbs_ of the skin;\\non hairless regions small bulbs called the _corpuscles of Meissner_\\nserve this purpose. _Pain_ is thought to be mediated by free nerve\\nendings. _Cold_ depends on end-organs called the _bulbs of Krause_; and\\n_warmth_ on the _Ruffinian corpuscles_.\\n\\nCutaneous or skin sensation may arise from either _mechanical_\\nstimulation, such as pressure, a blow, or tickling, from _thermal_\\nstimulation from hot or cold objects, from _electrical_ stimulation, or\\nfrom the action of certain _chemicals_, such as acids and the like.\\nStimulated mechanically, the skin gives us but two sensation qualities,\\n_pressure_ and _pain_. Many of the qualities which we commonly ascribe\\nto the skin sensations are really a complex of cutaneous and muscular\\nsensations. _Contact_ is light pressure. _Hardness_ and _softness_\\ndepend on the intensity of the pressure. _Roughness_ and _smoothness_\\narise from interrupted and continuous pressure, respectively, and\\nrequire movement over the rough or smooth surface. _Touch_ depends on\\npressure accompanied by the muscular sensations involved in the\\nmovements connected with the act. Pain is clearly a different sensation\\nfrom pressure; but any of the cutaneous or muscular sensations may, by\\nexcessive stimulation, be made to pass over into pain. All parts of the\\nskin are sensitive to pressure and pain; but certain parts, like the\\nfinger tips, and the tip of the tongue, are more highly sensitive than\\nothers. The skin varies also in its sensitivity to _heat_ and _cold_. If\\nwe take a hot or a very cold pencil point and pass it rather lightly and\\nslowly over the skin, it is easy to discover certain spots from which a\\nsensation of warmth or of cold flashes out. In this way it is possible\\nto locate the end-organs of temperature very accurately.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Diagram showing distribution of hot and cold\\nspots on the back of the hand. C, cold spots; H, hot spots.]\\n\\nTHE KINÆSTHETIC SENSES.--The muscles, tendons, and joints also give rise\\nto perfectly definite sensations, but they have not been named as have\\nthe sensations from most of the other end-organs. _Weight_ is the most\\nclearly marked of these sensations. It is through the sensations\\nconnected with movements of muscles, tendons, and joints that we come to\\njudge _form_, _size_, and _distance_.\\n\\nTHE ORGANIC SENSES.--Finally, to the sensations mentioned so far must be\\nadded those which come from the internal organs of the body. From the\\nalimentary canal we get the sensations of _hunger_, _thirst_, and\\n_nausea_; from the heart, lungs, and organs of sex come numerous\\nwell-defined but unnamed sensations which play an important part in\\nmaking up the feeling-tone of our daily lives.\\n\\nThus we see that the senses may be looked upon as the sentries of the\\nbody, standing at the outposts where nature and ourselves meet. They\\ndiscover the qualities of the various objects with which we come in\\ncontact and hand them over to the mind in the form of sensations. And\\nthese sensations are the raw material out of which we begin to construct\\nour material environment. Only as we are equipped with good organs of\\nsense, especially good eyes and ears, therefore, are we able to enter\\nfully into the wonderful world about us and receive the stimuli\\nnecessary to our thought and action.\\n\\n\\n4. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Observe a schoolroom of children at work with the aim of discovering\\nany that show defects of vision or hearing. What are the symptoms? What\\nis the effect of inability to hear or see well upon interest and\\nattention?\\n\\n2. Talk with your teacher about testing the eyes and ears of the\\nchildren of some school. The simpler tests for vision and hearing are\\neasily applied, and the expense for material almost nothing. What tests\\nshould be used? Does your school have the test card for vision?\\n\\n3. Use a rotator or color tops for mixing discs of white and black to\\nproduce different shades of gray. Fix in mind the gray made of half\\nwhite and half black; three-fourths white and one-fourth black;\\none-fourth-white and three-fourths black.\\n\\n4. In the same way mix the two complementaries yellow and blue to\\nproduce a gray; mix red and green in the same way. Try various\\ncombinations of the four fundamental colors, and discover how different\\ncolors are produced. Seek for these same colors in nature--sky, leaves,\\nflowers, etc.\\n\\n5. Take a large wire nail and push it through a cork so that it can be\\nhandled without touching the metal with the fingers. Now cool it in ice\\nor very cold water, then dry it and move the point slowly across the\\nback of the hand. Do you feel occasional thrills of cold as the point\\npasses over a bulb of Krause? Heat the nail with a match flame or over a\\nlamp, and perform the same experiment. Do you feel the thrills of heat\\nfrom the corpuscles of Ruffini?\\n\\n6. Try stopping the nostrils with cotton and having someone give you\\nscraped apple, potato, onion, etc., and see whether, by taste alone, you\\ncan distinguish the difference. Why cannot sulphur be tasted?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nPERCEPTION\\n\\n\\nNo young child at first sees objects as we see them, or hears sounds as\\nwe hear them. This power, the power of perception, is a gradual\\ndevelopment. It grows day by day out of the learner\\'s experience in his\\nworld of sights and sounds, and whatever other fields his senses respond\\nto.\\n\\n\\n1. THE FUNCTION OF PERCEPTION\\n\\nNEED OF KNOWING THE MATERIAL WORLD.--It is the business of perception to\\ngive us knowledge of our world of material _objects_ and their relations\\nin _space_ and _time_. The material world which we enter through the\\ngateways of the senses is more marvelous by far than any fairy world\\ncreated by the fancy of story-tellers; for it contains the elements of\\nall they have conceived and much more besides. It is more marvelous than\\nany structure planned and executed by the mind of man; for all the\\nwonders and beauties of the Coliseum or of St. Peter\\'s existed in nature\\nbefore they were discovered by the architect and thrown together in\\nthose magnificent structures. The material advancement of civilization\\nhas been but the discovery of the objects, forces, and laws of nature,\\nand their use in inventions serviceable to men. And these forces and\\nlaws of nature were discovered only as they were made manifest through\\nobjects in the material world.\\n\\nThe problem lying before each individual who would enter fully into this\\nrich world of environment, then, is to discover at first hand just as\\nlarge a part of the material world about him as possible. In the most\\nhumble environment of the most uneventful life is to be found the\\nmaterial for discoveries and inventions yet undreamed of. Lying in the\\nshade of an apple tree under the open sky, Newton read from a falling\\napple the fundamental principles of the law of gravitation which has\\nrevolutionized science; sitting at a humble tea table Watt watched the\\ngurgling of the steam escaping from the kettle, and evolved the steam\\nengine therefrom; with his simple kite, Franklin drew down the lightning\\nfrom the clouds, and started the science of electricity; through\\nstudying a ball, the ancient scholars conceived the earth to be a\\nsphere, and Columbus discovered America.\\n\\nTHE PROBLEM WHICH CONFRONTS THE CHILD.--Well it is that the child,\\nstarting his life\\'s journey, cannot see the magnitude of the task before\\nhim. Cast amid a world of objects of whose very existence he is\\nignorant, and whose meaning and uses have to be learned by slow and\\noften painful experience, he proceeds step by step through the senses in\\nhis discovery of the objects about him. Yet, considered again, we\\nourselves are after all but a step in advance of the child. Though we\\nare somewhat more familiar with the use of our senses than he, and know\\na few more objects about us, yet the knowledge of the wisest of us is at\\nbest pitifully meager compared with the richness of nature. So\\nimpossible is it for us to know all our material environment, that men\\nhave taken to becoming specialists. One man will spend his life in the\\nstudy of a certain variety of plants, while there are hundreds of\\nthousands of varieties all about him; another will study a particular\\nkind of animal life, perhaps too minute to be seen with the naked eye,\\nwhile the world is teeming with animal forms which he has not time in\\nhis short day of life to stop to examine; another will study the land\\nforms and read the earth\\'s history from the rocks and geological strata,\\nbut here again nature\\'s volume is so large that he has time to read but\\na small fraction of the whole. Another studies the human body and learns\\nto read from its expressions the signs of health and sickness, and to\\nprescribe remedies for its ills; but in this field also he has found it\\nnecessary to divide the work, and so we have specialists for almost\\nevery organ of the body.\\n\\n\\n2. THE NATURE OF PERCEPTION\\n\\nHOW A PERCEPT IS FORMED.--How, then, do we proceed to the discovery of\\nthis world of objects? Let us watch the child and learn the secret from\\nhim. Give the babe a ball, and he applies every sense to it to discover\\nits qualities. He stares at it, he takes it in his hands and turns it\\nover and around, he lifts it, he strokes it, he punches it and jabs it,\\nhe puts it to his mouth and bites it, he drops it, he throws it and\\ncreeps after it. He leaves no stone unturned to find out what that thing\\nreally is. By means of the _qualities_ which come to him through the\\navenues of sense, he constructs the _object_. And not only does he come\\nto know the ball as a material object, but he comes to know also its\\nuses. He is forming his own best definition of a ball in terms of the\\nsensations which he gets from it and the uses to which he puts it, and\\nall this even before he can name it or is able to recognize its name\\nwhen he hears it. How much better his method than the one he will have\\nto follow a little later when he goes to school and learns that \"A ball\\nis a spherical body of any substance or size, used to play with, as by\\nthrowing, kicking, or knocking, etc.!\"\\n\\nTHE PERCEPT INVOLVES ALL RELATIONS OF THE OBJECT.--Nor is the case in\\nthe least different with ourselves. When we wish to learn about a new\\nobject or discover new facts about an old one, we do precisely as the\\nchild does if we are wise. We apply to it every sense to which it will\\nafford a stimulus, and finally arrive at the object through its various\\nqualities. And just in so far as we have failed to use in connection\\nwith it every sense to which it can minister, just in that degree will\\nwe have an incomplete perception of it. Indeed, just so far as we have\\nfailed finally to perceive it in terms of its functions or uses, in that\\nfar also have we failed to know it completely. Tomatoes were for many\\nyears grown as ornamental garden plants before it was discovered that\\nthe tomatoes could minister to the taste as well as to the sight. The\\nclothing of civilized man gives the same sensation of texture and color\\nto the savage that it does to its owner, but he is so far from\\nperceiving it in the same way that he packs it away and continues to go\\nnaked. The Orientals, who disdain the use of chairs and prefer to sit\\ncross-legged on the floor, can never perceive a chair just as we do who\\nuse chairs daily, and to whom chairs are so saturated with social\\nsuggestions and associations.\\n\\nTHE CONTENT OF THE PERCEPT.--The percept, then, always contains a basis\\nof _sensation_. The eye, the ear, the skin or some other sense organ\\nmust turn in its supply of sensory material or there can be no percept.\\nBut the percept contains more than just sensations. Consider, for\\nexample, your percept of an automobile flashing past your windows. You\\nreally _see_ but very little of it, yet you _perceive_ it as a very\\nfamiliar vehicle. All that your sense organs furnish is a more or less\\nblurred patch of black of certain size and contour, one or more objects\\nof somewhat different color whom you know to be passengers, and various\\nsounds of a whizzing, chugging or roaring nature. Your former experience\\nwith automobiles enables you to associate with these meager sensory\\ndetails the upholstered seats, the whirling wheels, the swaying movement\\nand whatever else belongs to the full meaning of a motor car.\\n\\nThe percept that contained only sensory material, and lacked all memory\\nelements, ideas and meanings, would be no percept at all. And this is\\nthe reason why a young child cannot see or hear like ourselves. It lacks\\nthe associative material to give significance and meaning to the sensory\\nelements supplied by the end-organs. The dependence of the percept on\\nmaterial from past experience is also illustrated in the common\\nstatement that what one gets from an art exhibit or a concert depends on\\nwhat he brings to it. He who brings no knowledge, no memory, no images\\nfrom other pictures or music will secure but relatively barren percepts,\\nconsisting of little besides the mere sensory elements. Truly, \"to him\\nthat hath shall be given\" in the realm of perception.\\n\\nTHE ACCURACY OF PERCEPTS DEPENDS ON EXPERIENCE.--We must perceive\\nobjects through our motor response to them as well as in terms of\\nsensations. The boy who has his knowledge of a tennis racket from\\nlooking at one in a store window, or indeed from handling one and\\nlooking it over in his room, can never know a tennis racket as does the\\nboy who plays with it on the court. Objects get their significance not\\nalone from their qualities, but even more from their use as related to\\nour own activities.\\n\\nLike the child, we must get our knowledge of objects, if we are to get\\nit well, from the objects themselves at first hand, and not second hand\\nthrough descriptions of them by others. The fact that there is so much\\nof the material world about us that we can never hope to learn it all,\\nhas made it necessary to put down in books many of the things which have\\nbeen discovered concerning nature. This necessity has, I fear, led many\\naway from nature itself to books--away from the living reality of things\\nto the dead embalming cases of words, in whose empty forms we see so\\nlittle of the significance which resides in the things themselves. We\\nare in danger of being satisfied with the _forms_ of knowledge without\\nits _substance_--with definitions contained in words instead of in\\nqualities and uses.\\n\\nNOT DEFINITIONS, BUT FIRST-HAND CONTACT.--In like manner we come to know\\ndistance, form and size. If we have never become acquainted with a mile\\nby actually walking a mile, running a mile, riding a bicycle a mile,\\ndriving a horse a mile, or traveling a mile on a train, we might listen\\nfor a long time to someone tell how far a mile is, or state the distance\\nfrom Chicago to Denver, without knowing much about it in any way except\\nword definitions. In order to understand a mile, we must come to know it\\nin as many ways as possible through sense activities of our own.\\nAlthough many children have learned that it is 25,000 miles around the\\nearth, probably no one who has not encircled the globe has any\\nreasonably accurate notion just how far this is. For words cannot take\\nthe place of perceptions in giving us knowledge. In the case of shorter\\ndistances, the same rule holds. The eye must be assisted by experience\\nof the muscles and tendons and joints in actually covering distance, and\\nlearn to associate these sensations with those of the eye before the\\neye alone can be able to say, \"That tree is ten rods distant.\" Form and\\nsize are to be learned in the same way. The hands must actually touch\\nand handle the object, experiencing its hardness or smoothness, the way\\nthis curve and that angle feels, the amount of muscular energy it takes\\nto pass the hand over this surface and along that line, the eye taking\\nnote all the while, before the eye can tell at a glance that yonder\\nobject is a sphere and that this surface is two feet on the edge.\\n\\n\\n3. THE PERCEPTION OF SPACE\\n\\nMany have been the philosophical controversies over the nature of space\\nand our perception of it. The psychologists have even quarreled\\nconcerning whether we possess an _innate_ sense of space, or whether it\\nis a product of experience and training. Fortunately, for our present\\npurpose we shall not need to concern ourselves with either of these\\ncontroversies. For our discussion we may accept space for what common\\nsense understands it to be. As to our sense of space, whatever of this\\nwe may possess at birth, it certainly has to be developed by use and\\nexperience to become of practical value. In the perception of space we\\nmust come to perceive _distance_, _direction_, _size_, and _form_. As a\\nmatter of fact, however, size is but so much distance, and form is but\\nso much distance in this, that, or the other direction.\\n\\nTHE PERCEIVING OF DISTANCE.--Unquestionably the eye comes to be our\\nchief dependence in determining distance. Yet the muscle and joint\\nsenses give us our earliest knowledge of distance. The babe reaches for\\nthe moon simply because the eye does not tell it that the moon is out of\\nreach. Only as the child reaches for its playthings, creeps or walks\\nafter them, and in a thousand ways uses its muscles and joints in\\nmeasuring distance, does the perception of distance become dependable.\\n\\nAt the same time the eye is slowly developing its power of judging\\ndistance. But not for several years does visual perception of distance\\nbecome in any degree accurate. The eye\\'s perception of distance depends\\nin part on the sensations arising from the muscles controlling the eye,\\nprobably in part from the adjustment of the lens, and in part from the\\nretinal image. If one tries to look at the tip of his nose he easily\\nfeels the muscle strain caused by the required angle of adjustment. We\\ncome unconsciously to associate distance with the muscle sensations\\narising from the different angles of vision. The part played by the\\nretinal image in judging distance is easily understood in looking at two\\ntrees, one thirty feet and the other three hundred feet distant. We note\\nthat the nearer tree shows the _detail_ of the bark and leaves, while\\nthe more distant one lacks this detail. The nearer tree also reflects\\nmore _light_ and _color_ than the one farther away. These minute\\ndifferences, registered as they are on the retinal image, come to stand\\nfor so much of distance.\\n\\nThe ear also learns to perceive distance through differences in the\\nquality and the intensity of sound. Auditory perception of distance is,\\nhowever, never very accurate.\\n\\nTHE PERCEIVING OF DIRECTION.--The motor senses probably give us our\\nfirst perception of direction, as they do of distance. The child has to\\nreach this way or that way for his rattle; turn the eyes or head so far\\nin order to see an interesting object; twist the body, crawl or walk to\\none side or the other to secure his bottle. In these experiences he is\\ngaining his first knowledge of direction.\\n\\nAlong with these muscle-joint experiences, the eye is also being\\ntrained. The position of the image on the retina comes to stand for\\ndirection, and the eye finally develops so remarkable a power of\\nperceiving direction that a picture hung a half inch out of plumb is a\\nsource of annoyance. The ear develops some skill in the perception of\\ndirection, but is less dependable than the eye.\\n\\n\\n4. THE PERCEPTION OF TIME\\n\\nThe philosophers and psychologists agree little better about our sense\\nof time than they do about our sense of space. Of this much, however, we\\nmay be certain, our perception of time is subject to development and\\ntraining.\\n\\nNATURE OF THE TIME SENSE.--How we perceive time is not so well\\nunderstood as our perception of space. It is evident, however, that our\\nidea of time is simpler than our idea of space--it has less of content,\\nless that we can describe. Probably the most fundamental part of our\\nidea of time is _progression_, or change, without which it is difficult\\nto think of time at all. The question then becomes, how do we perceive\\nchange, or succession?\\n\\nIf one looks in upon his thought stream he finds that the movement of\\nconsciousness is not uniformly continuous, but that his thought moves in\\npulses, or short rushes, so to speak. When we are seeking for some fact\\nor conclusion, there is a moment of expectancy, or poising, and then the\\nleap forward to the desired point, or conclusion, from which an\\nimmediate start is taken for the next objective point of our thinking.\\nIt is probable that our sense of the few seconds of passing time that\\nwe call the _immediate present_ consists of the recognition of the\\nsuccession of these pulsations of consciousness, together with certain\\norganic rhythms, such as heart beat and breathing.\\n\\nNO PERCEPTION OF EMPTY TIME.--Our perception does not therefore act upon\\nempty time. Time must be filled with a procession of events, whether\\nthese be within our own consciousness or in the objective world without.\\nAll longer periods of time, such as hours, days, or years, are measured\\nby the events which they contain. Time filled with happenings that\\ninterest and attract us seems short while passing, but longer when\\nlooked back upon. On the other hand, time relatively empty of\\ninteresting experience hangs heavy on our hands in passing, but, viewed\\nin retrospect, seems short. A fortnight of travel passes more quickly\\nthan a fortnight of illness, but yields many more events for the memory\\nto review as the \"filling\" for time.\\n\\nProbably no one has any very accurate feeling of the length, that is,\\nthe actual _duration_ of a year--or even of a month! We therefore divide\\ntime into convenient units, as weeks, months, years and centuries. This\\nallows us to think of time in mathematical terms where immediate\\nperception fails in its grasp.\\n\\n\\n5. THE TRAINING OF PERCEPTION\\n\\nIn the physical world as in the spiritual there are many people who,\\n\"having eyes, see not and ears, hear not.\" For the ability to perceive\\naccurately and richly in the world of physical objects depends not alone\\non good sense organs, but also on _interest_ and the habit of\\n_observation_. It is easy if we are indifferent or untrained to look at\\na beautiful landscape, a picture or a cathedral without _seeing_ it; it\\nis easy if we lack interest or skill to listen to an orchestra or the\\nmyriad sounds of nature without _hearing_ them.\\n\\nPERCEPTION NEEDS TO BE TRAINED.--Training in perception does not depend\\nentirely on the work of the school. For the world about us exerts a\\nconstant appeal to our senses. A thousand sights, sounds, contacts,\\ntastes, smells or other sensations, hourly throng in upon us, and the\\nappeal is irresistible. We must in some degree attend. We must observe.\\n\\nYet it cannot be denied that most of us are relatively unskilled in\\nperception; we do not know how, or take the trouble to observe. For\\nexample, a stranger was brought into the classroom and introduced by the\\ninstructor to a class of fifty college students in psychology. The class\\nthought the stranger was to address them, and looked at him with mild\\ncuriosity. But, after standing before them for a few moments, he\\nsuddenly withdrew, as had been arranged by the instructor. The class\\nwere then asked to write such a description of the stranger as would\\nenable a person who had never seen him to identify him. But so poor had\\nbeen the observation of the class that they ascribed to him clothes of\\nfour different colors, eyes and hair each of three different colors, a\\ntie of many different hues, height ranging from five feet and four\\ninches to over six feet, age from twenty-eight to forty-five years, and\\nmany other details as wide of the mark. Nor is it probable that this\\nparticular class was below the average in the power of perception.\\n\\nSCHOOL TRAINING IN PERCEPTION.--The school can do much in training the\\nperception. But to accomplish this, the child must constantly be brought\\ninto immediate contact with the physical world about him and taught to\\nobserve. Books must not be substituted for things. Definitions must not\\ntake the place of experiment or discovery. Geography and nature study\\nshould be taught largely out of doors, and the lessons assigned should\\ntake the child into the open for observation and investigation. All\\nthings that live and grow, the sky and clouds, the sunset colors, the\\nbrown of upturned soil, the smell of the clover field, or the new mown\\nhay, the sounds of a summer night, the distinguishing marks by which to\\nidentify each family of common birds or breed of cattle--these and a\\nthousand other things that appeal to us from the simplest environment\\nafford a rich opportunity for training the perception. And he who has\\nlearned to observe, and who is alert to the appeal of nature, has no\\nsmall part of his education already assured.\\n\\n\\n6. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Test your power of observation by walking rapidly past a well-filled\\nstore window and then seeing how many of the objects you can name.\\n\\n2. Suppose a tailor, a bootblack, a physician, and a detective are\\nstanding on the street corner as you pass by. What will each one be most\\nlikely to observe about you? _Why?_\\n\\n3. Observe carefully green trees at a distance of a few rods; a quarter\\nof a mile; a mile; several miles. Describe differences (1) in color, (2)\\nin brightness, or light, and (3) in detail.\\n\\n4. How many common birds can you identify? How many kinds of trees? Of\\nwild flowers? Of weeds?\\n\\n5. Observe the work of an elementary school for the purpose of\\ndetermining:\\n\\na. Whether the instruction in geography, nature study, agriculture,\\netc., calls for the use of the eyes, ears and fingers.\\n\\nb. Whether definitions are used in place of first-hand information in\\nany subjects.\\n\\nc. Whether the assignment of lessons to pupils includes work that would\\nrequire the use of the senses, especially out of doors.\\n\\nd. Whether the work offered in arithmetic demands the use of the senses\\nas well as the reason.\\n\\ne. Whether the language lessons make use of the power of observation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nMENTAL IMAGES AND IDEAS\\n\\n\\nAs you sit thinking, a company of you together, your thoughts run in\\nmany diverse lines. Yet with all this diversity, your minds possess this\\ncommon characteristic: _Though your thinking all takes place in what we\\ncall the present moment, it goes on largely in terms of past\\nexperiences._\\n\\n\\n1. THE PART PLAYED BY PAST EXPERIENCE\\n\\nPRESENT THINKING DEPENDS ON PAST EXPERIENCE.--Images or ideas of things\\nyou have seen or heard or felt; of things you have thought of before and\\nwhich now recur to you; of things you remember, such as names, dates,\\nplaces, events; of things that you do not remember as a part of your\\npast at all, but that belong to it nevertheless--these are the things\\nwhich form a large part of your mental stream, and which give content to\\nyour thinking. You may think of a thing that is going on now, or of one\\nthat is to occur in the future; but, after all, you are dependent on\\nyour past experience for the material which you put into your thinking\\nof the present moment.\\n\\nIndeed, nothing can enter your present thinking which does not link\\nitself to something in your past experience. The savage Indian in the\\nprimeval forest never thought about killing a deer with a rifle merely\\nby pulling a trigger, or of turning a battery of machine guns on his\\nenemies to annihilate them--none of these things were related to his\\npast experience; hence he could not think in such terms.\\n\\nTHE PRESENT INTERPRETED BY THE PAST.--Not only can we not think at all\\nexcept in terms of our past experience, but even if we could, the\\npresent would be meaningless to us; for the present is interpreted in\\nthe light of the past. The sedate man of affairs who decries athletic\\nsports, and has never taken part in them, cannot understand the wild\\nenthusiasm which prevails between rival teams in a hotly contested\\nevent. The fine work of art is to the one who has never experienced the\\nappeal which comes through beauty, only so much of canvas and variegated\\npatches of color. Paul says that Jesus was \"unto the Greeks,\\nfoolishness.\" He was foolishness to them because nothing in their\\nexperience with their own gods had been enough like the character of\\nJesus to enable them to interpret Him.\\n\\nTHE FUTURE ALSO DEPENDS ON THE PAST.--To the mind incapable of using\\npast experience, the future also would be impossible; for we can look\\nforward into the future only by placing in its experiences the elements\\nof which we have already known. The savage who has never seen the\\nshining yellow metal does not dream of a heaven whose streets are paved\\nwith gold, but rather of a \"happy hunting ground.\" If you will analyze\\nyour own dreams of the future you will see in them familiar pictures\\nperhaps grouped together in new forms, but coming, in their elements,\\nfrom your past experience nevertheless. All that would remain to a mind\\ndevoid of a past would be the little bridge of time which we call the\\n\"present moment,\" a series of unconnected _nows_. Thought would be\\nimpossible, for the mind would have nothing to compare and relate.\\nPersonality would not exist; for personality requires continuity of\\nexperience, else we should be a new person each succeeding moment,\\nwithout memory and without plans. Such a mind would be no mind at all.\\n\\nRANK DETERMINED BY ABILITY TO UTILIZE PAST EXPERIENCE.--So important is\\npast experience in determining our present thinking and guiding our\\nfuture actions, that the place of an individual in the scale of creation\\nis determined largely by the ability to profit by past experience. The\\nscientist tells us of many species of animals now extinct, which lost\\ntheir lives and suffered their race to die out because when, long ago,\\nthe climate began to change and grow much colder, they were unable to\\nuse the experience of suffering in the last cold season as an incentive\\nto provide shelter, or move to a warmer climate against the coming of\\nthe next and more rigorous one. Man was able to make the adjustment;\\nand, providing himself with clothing and shelter and food, he survived,\\nwhile myriads of the lower forms perished.\\n\\nThe singed moth again and again dares the flame which tortures it, and\\nat last gives its life, a sacrifice to its folly; the burned child fears\\nthe fire, and does not the second time seek the experience. So also can\\nthe efficiency of an individual or a nation, as compared with other\\nindividuals or nations, be determined. The inefficient are those who\\nrepeat the same error or useless act over and over, or else fail to\\nrepeat a chance useful act whose repetition might lead to success. They\\nare unable to learn their lesson and be guided by experience. Their past\\ndoes not sufficiently minister to their present, and through it direct\\ntheir future.\\n\\n\\n2. HOW PAST EXPERIENCE IS CONSERVED\\n\\nPAST EXPERIENCE CONSERVED IN BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL TERMS.--If past\\nexperience plays so important a part in our welfare, how, then, is it to\\nbe conserved so that we may secure its benefits? Here, as elsewhere, we\\nfind the mind and body working in perfect unison and harmony, each doing\\nits part to further the interests of both. The results of our past\\nexperience may be read in both our mental and our physical nature.\\n\\nOn the physical side past experience is recorded in modified structure\\nthrough the law of habit working on the tissues of the body, and\\nparticularly on the delicate tissues of the brain and nervous system.\\nThis is easily seen in its outward aspects. The stooped shoulders and\\nbent form of the workman tell a tale of physical toil and exposure; the\\nbloodless lips and pale face of the victim of the city sweat shop tell\\nof foul air, long hours, and insufficient food; the rosy cheek and\\nbounding step of childhood speak of fresh air, good food and happy play.\\n\\nOn the mental side past experience is conserved chiefly by means of\\n_images_, _ideas_, and _concepts_. The nature and function of concepts\\nwill be discussed in a later chapter. It will now be our purpose to\\nexamine the nature of images and ideas, and to note the part they play\\nin the mind\\'s activities.\\n\\nTHE IMAGE AND THE IDEA.--To understand the nature of the image, and then\\nof the idea, we may best go back to the percept. You look at a watch\\nwhich I hold before your eyes and secure a percept of it. Briefly, this\\nis what happens: The light reflected from the yellow object, on striking\\nthe retina, results in a nerve current which sets up a certain form of\\nactivity in the cells of the visual brain area, and lo! a _percept_ of\\nthe watch flashes in your mind.\\n\\nNow I put the watch in my pocket, so that the stimulus is no longer\\npresent to your eye. Then I ask you to think of my watch just as it\\nappeared as you were looking at it; or you may yourself choose to think\\nof it without my suggesting it to you. In either case _the cellular\\nactivity in the visual area of the cortex is reproduced_ approximately\\nas it occurred in connection with the percept, and lo! an _image_ of the\\nwatch flashes in your mind. An image is thus an approximate copy of a\\nformer percept (or several percepts). It is aroused indirectly by means\\nof a nerve current coming by way of some other brain center, instead of\\ndirectly by the stimulation of a sense organ, as in the case of a\\npercept.\\n\\nIf, instead of seeking a more or less exact mental _picture_ of my\\nwatch, you only think of its general _meaning_ and relations, the fact\\nthat it is of gold, that it is for the purpose of keeping time, that it\\nwas a present to me, that I wear it in my left pocket, you then have an\\n_idea_ of the watch. Our idea of an object is, therefore, the general\\nmeaning of relations we ascribe to it. It should be remembered, however,\\nthat the terms image and idea are employed rather loosely, and that\\nthere is not yet general uniformity among writers in their use.\\n\\nALL OUR PAST EXPERIENCE POTENTIALLY AT OUR COMMAND.--Images may in a\\ncertain sense take the place of percepts, and we can again experience\\nsights, sounds, tastes, and smells which we have known before, without\\nhaving the stimuli actually present to the senses. In this way all our\\npast experience is potentially available to the present. All the objects\\nwe have seen, it is potentially possible again to see in the mind\\'s eye\\nwithout being obliged to have the objects before us; all the sounds we\\nhave heard, all the tastes and smells and temperatures we have\\nexperienced, we may again have presented to our minds in the form of\\nmental images without the various stimuli being present to the\\nend-organs of the senses.\\n\\nThrough images and ideas the total number of objects in our experience\\nis infinitely multiplied; for many of the things we have seen, or heard,\\nor smelled, or tasted, we cannot again have present to the senses, and\\nwithout this power we would never get them again. And besides this fact,\\nit would be inconvenient to have to go and secure afresh each sensation\\nor percept every time we need to use it in our thought. While _habit_,\\nthen, conserves our past experience on the physical side, the _image_\\nand the _idea_ do the same thing on the mental side.\\n\\n\\n3. INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN IMAGERY\\n\\nIMAGES TO BE VIEWED BY INTROSPECTION.--The remainder of the description\\nof images will be easier to understand, for each of you can know just\\nwhat is meant in every case by appealing to your own mind. I beg of you\\nnot to think that I am presenting something new and strange, a curiosity\\nconnected with our thinking which has been discovered by scholars who\\nhave delved more deeply into the matter than we can hope to do. Every\\nday--no, more than that, every hour and every moment--these images are\\nflitting through our minds, forming a large part of our stream of\\nconsciousness. Let us see whether we can turn our attention within and\\ndiscover some of our images in their flight. Let us introspect.\\n\\nI know of no better way to proceed than that adopted by Francis Galton\\nyears ago, when he asked the English men of letters and science to think\\nof their breakfast tables, and then describe the images which appeared.\\nI am about to ask each one of you to do the same thing, but I want to\\nwarn you beforehand that the images will not be so vivid as the sensory\\nexperiences themselves. They will be much fainter and more vague, and\\nless clear and definite; they will be fleeting, and must be caught on\\nthe wing. Often the image may fade entirely out, and the idea only be\\nleft.\\n\\nTHE VARIED IMAGERY SUGGESTED BY ONE\\'S DINING TABLE.--Let each one now\\nrecall the dining table as you last left it, and then answer questions\\nconcerning it like the following:\\n\\nCan I see clearly in my \"mind\\'s eye\" the whole table as it stood spread\\nbefore me? Can I see all parts of it equally clearly? Do I get the snowy\\nwhite and gloss of the linen? The delicate coloring of the china, so\\nthat I can see where the pink shades off into the white? The graceful\\nlines and curves of the dishes? The sheen of the silver? The brown of\\nthe toast? The yellow of the cream? The rich red and dark green of the\\nbouquet of roses? The sparkle of the glassware?\\n\\nCan I again hear the rattle of the dishes? The clink of the spoon\\nagainst the cup? The moving up of the chairs? The chatter of the voices,\\neach with its own peculiar pitch and quality? The twitter of a bird\\noutside the window? The tinkle of a distant bell? The chirp of a\\nneighborly cricket?\\n\\nCan I taste clearly the milk? The coffee? The eggs? The bacon? The\\nrolls? The butter? The jelly? The fruit? Can I get the appetizing odor\\nof the coffee? Of the meat? The oranges and bananas? The perfume of the\\nlilac bush outside the door? The perfume from a handkerchief newly\\ntreated to a spray of heliotrope?\\n\\nCan I recall the touch of my fingers on the velvety peach? On the\\nsmooth skin of an apple? On the fretted glassware? The feel of the fresh\\nlinen? The contact of leather-covered or cane-seated chair? Of the\\nfreshly donned garment? Can I get clearly the temperature of the hot\\ncoffee in the mouth? Of the hot dish on the hand? Of the ice water? Of\\nthe grateful coolness of the breeze wafted in through the open window?\\n\\nCan I feel again the strain of muscle and joint in passing the heavy\\ndish? Can I feel the movement of the jaws in chewing the beefsteak? Of\\nthe throat and lips in talking? Of the chest and diaphragm in laughing?\\nOf the muscles in sitting and rising? In hand and arm in using knife and\\nfork and spoon? Can I get again the sensation of pain which accompanied\\nbiting on a tender tooth? From the shooting of a drop of acid from the\\nrind of the orange into the eye? The chance ache in the head? The\\npleasant feeling connected with the exhilaration of a beautiful morning?\\nThe feeling of perfect health? The pleasure connected with partaking of\\na favorite food?\\n\\nPOWER OF IMAGERY VARIES IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE.--It is more than probable\\nthat some of you cannot get perfectly clear images in all these lines,\\ncertainly not with equal facility; for the imagery from any one sense\\nvaries greatly from person to person. A celebrated painter was able,\\nafter placing his subject in a chair and looking at him attentively for\\na few minutes, to dismiss the subject and paint a perfect likeness of\\nhim from the visual image which recurred to the artist every time he\\nturned his eyes to the chair where the sitter had been placed. On the\\nother hand, a young lady, a student in my psychology class, tells me\\nthat she is never able to recall the looks of her mother when she is\\nabsent, even if the separation has been only for a few moments. She can\\nget an image of the form, with the color and cut of the dress, but never\\nthe features. One person may be able to recall a large part of a concert\\nthrough his auditory imagery, and another almost none.\\n\\nIn general it may be said that the power, or at least the use, of\\nimagery decreases with age. The writer has made a somewhat extensive\\nstudy of the imagery of certain high-school students, college students,\\nand specialists in psychology averaging middle age. Almost without\\nexception it was found that clear and vivid images played a smaller part\\nin the thinking of the older group than of the younger. More or less\\nabstract ideas and concepts seemed to have taken the place of the\\nconcrete imagery of earlier years.\\n\\nIMAGERY TYPES.--Although there is some difference in our ability to use\\nimagery of different sensory types, probably there is less variation\\nhere than has been supposed. Earlier pedagogical works spoke of the\\n_visual_ type of mind, or the _audile_ type, or the _motor_ type, as if\\nthe possession of one kind of imagery necessarily rendered a person\\nshort in other types. Later studies have shown this view incorrect,\\nhowever. The person who has good images of one type is likely to excel\\nin all types, while one who is lacking in any one of the more important\\ntypes will probably be found short in all.[4] Most of us probably make\\nmore use of visual and auditory than of other kinds of imagery, while\\nolfactory and gustatory images seem to play a minor rôle.\\n\\n\\n4. THE FUNCTION OF IMAGES\\n\\nBinet says that the man who has not every type of imagery almost equally\\nwell developed is only the fraction of a man. While this no doubt puts\\nthe matter too strongly, yet images do play an important part in our\\nthinking.\\n\\nIMAGES SUPPLY MATERIAL FOR IMAGINATION AND MEMORY.--Imagery supplies the\\npictures from which imagination builds its structures. Given a rich\\nsupply of images from the various senses, and imagination has the\\nmaterial necessary to construct times and events long since past, or to\\nfill the future with plans or experiences not yet reached. Lacking\\nimages, however, imagination is handicapped, and its meager products\\nreveal in their barrenness and their lack of warmth and reality the\\npoverty of material.\\n\\nMuch of our memory also takes the form of images. The face of a friend,\\nthe sound of a voice, or the touch of a hand may be recalled, not as a\\nmere fact, but with almost the freshness and fidelity of a percept. That\\nmuch of our memory goes on in the form of ideas instead of images is\\ntrue. But memory is often both aided in its accuracy and rendered more\\nvital and significant through the presence of abundant imagery.\\n\\nIMAGERY IN THE THOUGHT PROCESSES.--Since logical thinking deals more\\nwith relations and meanings than with particular objects, images\\nnaturally play a smaller part in reasoning than in memory and\\nimagination. Yet they have their place here as well. Students of\\ngeometry or trigonometry often have difficulty in understanding a\\ntheorem until they succeed in visualizing the surface or solid involved.\\nThinking in the field of astronomy, mechanics, and many other sciences\\nis assisted at certain points by the ability to form clear and accurate\\nimages.\\n\\nTHE USE OF IMAGERY IN LITERATURE.--Facility in the use of imagery\\nundoubtedly adds much to our enjoyment and appreciation of certain\\nforms of literature. The great writers commonly use all types of images\\nin their description and narration. If we are not able to employ the\\nimages they used, many of their most beautiful pictures are likely to be\\nto us but so many words suggesting prosaic ideas.\\n\\nShakespeare, describing certain beautiful music, appeals to the sense of\\nsmell to make himself understood:\\n\\n    ... it came o\\'er my ear like the sweet sound\\n    That breathes upon a bank of violets,\\n    Stealing and giving odor!\\n\\n_Lady Macbeth_ cries:\\n\\n    Here\\'s the smell of the blood still:\\n    All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.\\n\\nMilton has _Eve_ say of her dream of the fatal apple:\\n\\n    ... The pleasant sav\\'ry smell\\n    So quickened appetite, that I, methought,\\n    Could not but taste.\\n\\nLikewise with the sense of touch:\\n\\n    ... I take thy hand, this hand\\n    As soft as dove\\'s down, and as white as it.\\n\\nImagine a person devoid of delicate tactile imagery, with senseless\\nfinger tips and leaden footsteps, undertaking to interpret these\\nexquisite lines:\\n\\n    Thus I set my printless feet\\n    O\\'er the cowslip\\'s velvet head,\\n    That bends not as I tread.\\n\\nShakespeare thus appeals to the muscular imagery:\\n\\n    At last, a little shaking of mine arm\\n    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,\\n    He raised a sigh so piteous and profound\\n    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk\\n    And end his being.\\n\\nMany passages like the following appeal to the temperature images:\\n\\n    Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\\n    Thou dost not bite so nigh\\n    As benefits forgot!\\n\\nTo one whose auditory imagery is meager, the following lines will lose\\nsomething of their beauty:\\n\\n    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!\\n    Here we will sit and let the sounds of music\\n    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night\\n    Become the touches of sweet harmony.\\n\\nNote how much clear images will add to Browning\\'s words:\\n\\n    Are there not two moments in the adventure of a diver--one when a\\n    beggar he prepares to plunge, and one, when a prince he rises with\\n    his pearl?\\n\\nPOINTS WHERE IMAGES ARE OF GREATEST SERVICE.--Beyond question, many\\nimages come flooding into our minds which are irrelevant and of no\\nservice in our thinking. No one has failed to note many such. Further,\\nwe undoubtedly do much of our best thinking with few or no images\\npresent. Yet we need images. Where, then, are they most needed? _Images\\nare needed wherever the percepts which they represent would be of\\nservice._ Whatever one could better understand or enjoy or appreciate by\\nseeing it, hearing it, or perceiving it through some other sense, he can\\nbetter understand, enjoy or appreciate through images than by means of\\nideas only.\\n\\n\\n5. THE CULTIVATION OF IMAGERY\\n\\nIMAGES DEPEND ON SENSORY STIMULI.--The power of imaging can be\\ncultivated the same as any other ability.\\n\\nIn the first place, we may put down as an absolute requisite _such an\\nenvironment of sensory stimuli as will tempt every sense to be awake and\\nat its best_, that we may be led into a large acquaintance with the\\nobjects of our material environment. No one\\'s stock of sensory images is\\ngreater than the sum total of his sensory experiences. No one ever has\\nimages of sights, or sounds, or tastes, or smells which he has never\\nexperienced.\\n\\nLikewise, he must have had the fullest and freest possible liberty in\\nmotor activities. For not only is the motor act itself made possible\\nthrough the office of imagery, but the motor act clarifies and makes\\nuseful the images. The boy who has actually made a table, or a desk, or\\na box has ever afterward a different and a better image of one of these\\nobjects than before; so also when he has owned and ridden a bicycle, his\\nimage of this machine will have a different significance from that of\\nthe image founded upon the visual perception alone of the wheel he\\nlongingly looked at through the store window or in the other boy\\'s\\ndooryard.\\n\\nTHE INFLUENCE OF FREQUENT RECALL.--But sensory experiences and motor\\nresponses alone are not enough, though they are the basis of good\\nimagery. _There must be frequent recall._ The sunset may have been never\\nso brilliant, and the music never so entrancing; but if they are never\\nthought of and dwelt upon after they were first experienced, little will\\nremain of them after a very short time. It is by repeating them often in\\nexperience through imagery that they become fixed, so that they stand\\nready to do our bidding when we need next to use them.\\n\\nTHE RECONSTRUCTION OF OUR IMAGES.--To richness of experience and\\nfrequency of the recall of our images we must add one more factor;\\nnamely, that of their _reconstruction_ or working over. Few if any\\nimages are exact recalls of former percepts of objects. Indeed, such\\nwould be neither possible nor desirable. The images which we recall are\\nrecalled for a purpose, or in view of some future activity, and hence\\nmust be _selective_, or made up of the elements of several or many\\nformer related images.\\n\\nThus the boy who wishes to construct a box without a pattern to follow\\nrecalls the images of numerous boxes he may have seen, and from them all\\nhe has a new image made over from many former percepts and images, and\\nthis new image serves him as a working model. In this way he not only\\ngets a copy which he can follow to make his box, but he also secures a\\nnew product in the form of an image different from any he ever had\\nbefore, and is therefore by so much the richer. It is this working over\\nof our stock of old images into new and richer and more suggestive ones\\nthat constitutes the essence of constructive imagination.\\n\\nThe more types of imagery into which we can put our thought, the more\\nfully is it ours and the better our images. The spelling lesson needs\\nnot only to be taken in through the eye, that we may retain a visual\\nimage of the words, but also to be recited orally, so that the ear may\\nfurnish an auditory image, and the organs of speech a motor image of the\\ncorrect forms. It needs also to be written, and thus given into the\\nkeeping of the hand, which finally needs most of all to know and retain\\nit.\\n\\nThe reading lesson should be taken in through both the eye and the ear,\\nand then expressed by means of voice and gesture in as full and complete\\na way as possible, that it may be associated with motor images. The\\ngeography lesson needs not only to be read, but to be drawn, or molded,\\nor constructed. The history lesson should be made to appeal to every\\npossible form of imagery. The arithmetic lesson must be not only\\ncomputed, but measured, weighed, and pressed into actual service.\\n\\nThus we might carry the illustration into every line of education and\\nexperience, and the same truth holds. _What we desire to comprehend\\ncompletely and retain well, we must apprehend through all available\\nsenses and conserve in every possible type of image and form of\\nexpression._\\n\\n\\n6. PROBLEMS IN INTROSPECTION AND OBSERVATION\\n\\n1. Observe a reading class and try to determine whether the pupils\\npicture the scenes and events they read about. How can you tell?\\n\\n2. Similarly observe a history class. Do the pupils realize the events\\nas actually happening, and the personages as real, living people?\\n\\n3. Observe in a similar way a class in geography, and draw conclusions.\\nA pupil in computing the cost of plastering a certain room based the\\nfigures on the room _filled full of plaster_. How might visual imagery\\nhave saved the error?\\n\\n4. Imagine a three-inch cube. Paint it. Then saw it up into inch cubes,\\nleaving them all standing in the original form. How many inch cubes have\\npaint on three faces? How many on two faces? How many on one face? How\\nmany have no paint on them? Answer all these questions by referring to\\nyour imagery alone.\\n\\n5. Try often to recall images in the various sensory lines; determine in\\nwhat classes of images you are least proficient and try to improve in\\nthese lines.\\n\\n6. How is the singing teacher able, after his class has sung through\\nseveral scores, to tell that they are flatting?\\n\\n7. Study your imagery carefully for a few days to see whether you can\\ndiscover your predominating type of imagery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nIMAGINATION\\n\\n\\nEveryone desires to have a good imagination, yet not all would agree as\\nto what constitutes a good imagination. If I were to ask a group of you\\nwhether you have good imaginations, many of you would probably at once\\nfall to considering whether you are capable of taking wild flights into\\nimpossible realms of thought and evolving unrealities out of airy\\nnothings. You would compare yourself with great imaginative writers,\\nsuch as Stevenson, Poe, De Quincey, and judge your power of imagination\\nby your ability to produce such tales as made them famous.\\n\\n\\n1. THE PLACE OF IMAGINATION IN MENTAL ECONOMY\\n\\nBut such a measure for the imagination as that just stated is far too\\nnarrow. A good imagination, like a good memory, is the one which serves\\nits owner best. If DeQuincey and Poe and Stevenson and Bulwer found the\\ntype which led them into such dizzy flights the best for their\\nparticular purpose, well and good; but that is not saying that their\\ntype is the best for you, or that you may not rank as high in some other\\nfield of imaginative power as they in theirs. While you may lack in\\ntheir particular type of imagination, they may have been short in the\\ntype which will one day make you famous. The artisan, the architect, the\\nmerchant, the artist, the farmer, the teacher, the professional\\nman--all need imagination in their vocations not less than the writers\\nneed it in theirs, but each needs a specialized kind adapted to the\\nparticular work which he has to do.\\n\\nPRACTICAL NATURE OF IMAGINATION.--Imagination is not a process of\\nthought which must deal chiefly with unrealities and impossibilities,\\nand which has for its chief end our amusement when we have nothing\\nbetter to do than to follow its wanderings. It is, rather, a\\ncommonplace, necessary process which illumines the way for our everyday\\nthinking and acting--a process without which we think and act by\\nhaphazard chance or blind imitation. It is the process by which the\\nimages from our past experiences are marshaled, and made to serve our\\npresent. Imagination looks into the future and constructs our patterns\\nand lays our plans. It sets up our ideals and pictures us in the acts of\\nachieving them. It enables us to live our joys and our sorrows, our\\nvictories and our defeats before we reach them. It looks into the past\\nand allows us to live with the kings and seers of old, or it goes back\\nto the beginning and we see things in the process of the making. It\\ncomes into our present and plays a part in every act from the simplest\\nto the most complex. It is to the mental stream what the light is to the\\ntraveler who carries it as he passes through the darkness, while it\\ncasts its beams in all directions around him, lighting up what otherwise\\nwould be intolerable gloom.\\n\\nIMAGINATION IN THE INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY, LITERATURE, AND ART.--Let\\nus see some of the most common uses of the imagination. Suppose I\\ndescribe to you the battle of the Marne. Unless you can take the images\\nwhich my words suggest and build them into struggling, shouting,\\nbleeding soldiers; into forts and entanglements and breastworks; into\\nroaring cannon and whistling bullet and screaming shell--unless you can\\ntake all these separate images and out of them get one great unified\\ncomplex, then my description will be to you only so many words largely\\nwithout content, and you will lack the power to comprehend the\\nhistorical event in any complete way. Unless you can read the poem, and\\nout of the images suggested by the words reconstruct the picture which\\nwas in the mind of the author as he wrote \"The Village Blacksmith\" or\\n\"Snowbound,\" the significance will have dropped out, and the throbbing\\nscenes of life and action become only so many dead words, like the shell\\nof the chrysalis after the butterfly has left its shroud. Without the\\npower of imagination, the history of Washington\\'s winter at Valley Forge\\nbecomes a mere formal recital, and you can never get a view of the\\nsnow-covered tents, the wind-swept landscape, the tracks in the snow\\nmarked by the telltale drops of blood, or the form of the heartbroken\\ncommander as he kneels in the silent wood to pray for his army. Without\\nthe power to construct this picture as you read, you may commit the\\nwords, and be able to recite them, and to pass examination upon them,\\nbut the living reality of it will forever escape you.\\n\\nYour power of imagination determines your ability to interpret literature\\nof all kinds; for the interpretation of literature is nothing, after\\nall, but the reconstruction on our part of the pictures with their\\nmeanings which were in the mind of the writer as he penned the words,\\nand the experiencing of the emotions which moved him as he wrote. Small\\nuse indeed to read the history of the centuries unless we can see in it\\nliving, acting people, and real events occurring in actual environments.\\nSmall use to read the world\\'s great books unless their characters are\\nto us real men and women--our brothers and sisters, interpreted to us by\\nthe master minds of the ages. Anything less than this, and we are no\\nlonger dealing with literature, but with words--like musical sounds\\nwhich deal with no theme, or like picture frames in which no picture has\\nbeen set. Nor is the case different in listening to a speaker. His words\\nare to you only so many sensations of sounds of such and such pitches\\nand intensities and quality, unless your mind keeps pace with his and\\ncontinually builds the pictures which fill his thought as he speaks.\\nLacking imagination, the sculptures of Michael Angelo and the pictures\\nof Raphael are to you so many pieces of curiously shaped marble and\\ningeniously colored canvas. What the sculptor and the painter have\\nplaced before you must suggest to you images and thoughts from your own\\nexperience, to fill out and make alive the marble and the canvas, else\\nto you they are dead.\\n\\nIMAGINATION AND SCIENCE.--Nor is imagination less necessary in other\\nlines of study. Without this power of building living, moving pictures\\nout of images, there is small use to study science beyond what is\\nimmediately present to our senses; for some of the most fundamental laws\\nof science rest upon conceptions which can be grasped only as we have\\nthe power of imagination. The student who cannot get a picture of the\\nmolecules of matter, infinitely close to each other and yet never\\ntouching, all in vibratory motion, yet each within its own orbit, each a\\ncomplete unit in itself, yet capable of still further division into\\nsmaller particles,--the student who cannot see all this in a clear\\nvisual image can never at best have more than a most hazy notion of the\\ntheory of matter. And this means, finally, that the explanations of\\nlight and heat and sound, and much besides, will be to him largely a\\njumble of words which linger in his memory, perchance, but which never\\nvitally become a possession of his mind.\\n\\nSo with the world of the telescope. You may have at your disposal all\\nthe magnificent lenses and the accurate machinery owned by modern\\nobservatories; but if you have not within yourself the power to build\\nwhat these reveal to you, and what the books tell you, into the solar\\nsystem and still larger systems, you can never study astronomy except in\\na blind and piecemeal sort of way, and all the planets and satellites\\nand suns will never for you form themselves into a system, no matter\\nwhat the books may say about it.\\n\\nEVERYDAY USES OF IMAGINATION.--But we may consider a still more\\npractical phase of imagination, or at least one which has more to do\\nwith the humdrum daily life of most of us. Suppose you go to your\\nmilliner and tell her how you want your spring hat shaped and trimmed.\\nAnd suppose you have never been able to see this hat _in toto_ in your\\nmind, so as to get an idea of how it will look when completed, but have\\nonly a general notion, because you like red velvet, white plumes, and a\\nturned-up rim, that this combination will look well together. Suppose\\nyou have never been able to see how you would look in this particular\\nhat with your hair done in this or that way. If you are in this helpless\\nstate shall you not have to depend finally on the taste of the milliner,\\nor accept the \"model,\" and so fail to reveal any taste or individuality\\non your own part?\\n\\nHow many times have you been disappointed in some article of dress,\\nbecause when you planned it you were unable to see it all at once so as\\nto get the full effect; or else you could not see yourself in it, and so\\nbe able to judge whether it suited you! How many homes have in them\\ndraperies and rugs and wall paper and furniture which are in constant\\nquarrel because someone could not see before they were assembled that\\nthey were never intended to keep company! How many people who plan their\\nown houses, would build them just the same again after seeing them\\ncompleted? The man who can see a building complete before a brick has\\nbeen laid or a timber put in place, who can see it not only in its\\ndetails one by one as he runs them over in his mind, but can see the\\nbuilding in its entirety, is the only one who is safe to plan the\\nstructure. And this is the man who is drawing a large salary as an\\narchitect, for imaginations of this kind are in demand. Only the one who\\ncan see in his \"mind\\'s eye,\" before it is begun, the thing he would\\ncreate, is capable to plan its construction. And who will say that\\nability to work with images of these kinds is not of just as high a type\\nas that which results in the construction of plots upon which stories\\nare built!\\n\\nTHE BUILDING OF IDEALS AND PLANS.--Nor is the part of imagination less\\nmarked in the formation of our life\\'s ideals and plans. Everyone who is\\nnot living blindly and aimlessly must have some ideal, some pattern, by\\nwhich to square his life and guide his actions. At some time in our life\\nI am sure that each of us has selected the person who filled most nearly\\nour notion of what we should like to become, and measured ourselves by\\nthis pattern. But there comes a time when we must idealize even the most\\nperfect individual; when we invest the character with attributes which\\nwe have selected from some other person, and thus worship at a shrine\\nwhich is partly real and partly ideal.\\n\\nAs time goes on, we drop out more and more of the strictly individual\\nelement, adding correspondingly more of the ideal, until our pattern is\\nlargely a construction of our own imagination, having in it the best we\\nhave been able to glean from the many characters we have known. How\\nlarge a part these ever-changing ideals play in our lives we shall never\\nknow, but certainly the part is not an insignificant one. And happy the\\nyouth who is able to look into the future and see himself approximating\\nsome worthy ideal. He has caught a vision which will never allow him to\\nlag or falter in the pursuit of the flying goal which points the\\ndirection of his efforts.\\n\\nIMAGINATION AND CONDUCT.--Another great field for imagination is with\\nreference to conduct and our relations with others. Over and over again\\nthe thoughtless person has to say, \"I am sorry; I did not think.\" The\\n\"did not think\" simply means that he failed to realize through his\\nimagination what would be the consequences of his rash or unkind words.\\nHe would not be unkind, but he did not imagine how the other would feel;\\nhe did not put himself in the other\\'s place. Likewise with reference to\\nthe effects of our conduct on ourselves. What youth, taking his first\\ndrink of liquor, would continue if he could see a clear picture of\\nhimself in the gutter with bloated face and bloodshot eyes a decade\\nhence? Or what boy, slyly smoking one of his early cigarettes, would\\nproceed if he could see his haggard face and nerveless hand a few years\\nfarther along? What spendthrift would throw away his money on vanities\\ncould he vividly see himself in penury and want in old age? What\\nprodigal anywhere who, if he could take a good look at himself\\nsin-stained and broken as he returns to his \"father\\'s house\" after the\\nyears of debauchery in the \"far country\" would not hesitate long before\\nhe entered upon his downward career?\\n\\nIMAGINATION AND THINKING.--We have already considered the use of\\nimagination in interpreting the thoughts, feelings and handiwork of\\nothers. Let us now look a little more closely into the part it plays in\\nour own thinking. Suppose that, instead of reading a poem, we are\\nwriting one; instead of listening to a description of a battle, we are\\ndescribing it; instead of looking at the picture, we are painting it.\\nThen our object is to make others who may read our language, or listen\\nto our words, or view our handiwork, construct the mental images of the\\nsituation which furnished the material for our thought.\\n\\nOur words and other modes of expression are but the description of the\\nflow of images in our minds, and our problem is to make a similar stream\\nflow through the mind of the listener; but strange indeed would it be to\\nmake others see a situation which we ourselves cannot see; strange if we\\ncould draw a picture without being able to follow its outlines as we\\ndraw. Or suppose we are teaching science, and our object is to explain\\nthe composition of matter to someone, and make him understand how light,\\nheat, etc., depend on the theory of matter; strange if the listener\\nshould get a picture if we ourselves are unable to get it. Or, once\\nmore, suppose we are to describe some incident, and our aim is to make\\nits every detail stand out so clearly that no one can miss a single one.\\nIs it not evident that we can never make any of these images more clear\\nto those who listen to us or read our words than they are to ourselves?\\n\\n\\n2. THE MATERIAL USED BY IMAGINATION\\n\\nWhat is the material, the mental content, out of which imagination\\nbuilds its structures?\\n\\nIMAGES THE STUFF OF IMAGINATION.--Nothing can enter the imagination the\\nelements of which have not been in our past experience and then been\\nconserved in the form of images. The Indians never dreamed of a heaven\\nwhose streets are paved with gold, and in whose center stands a great\\nwhite throne. Their experience had given them no knowledge of these\\nthings; and so, perforce, they must build their heaven out of the images\\nwhich they had at command, namely, those connected with the chase and\\nthe forest. So their heaven was the \"happy hunting ground,\" inhabited by\\ngame and enemies over whom the blessed forever triumphed. Likewise the\\nvaliant soldiers whose deadly arrows and keen-edged swords and\\nbattle-axes won on the bloody field of Hastings, did not picture a\\nfar-off day when the opposing lines should kill each other with mighty\\nengines hurling death from behind parapets a dozen miles away. Firearms\\nand the explosive powder were yet unknown, hence there were no images\\nout of which to build such a picture.\\n\\nI do not mean that your imagination cannot construct an object which has\\nnever before been in your experience as a whole, for the work of the\\nimagination is to do precisely this thing. It takes the various images\\nat its disposal and builds them into _wholes_ which may never have\\nexisted before, and which may exist now only as a creation of the mind.\\nAnd yet we have put into this new product not a single _element_ which\\nwas not familiar to us in the form of an image of one kind or another.\\nIt is the _form_ which is new; the _material_ is old. This is\\nexemplified every time an inventor takes the two fundamental parts of a\\nmachine, the _lever_ and the _inclined plane_, and puts them together in\\nrelations new to each other and so evolves a machine whose complexity\\nfairly bewilders us. And with other lines of thinking, as in mechanics,\\ninventive power consists in being able to see the old in new relations,\\nand so constantly build new constructions out of old material. It is\\nthis power which gives us the daring and original thinker, the Newton\\nwhose falling apple suggested to him the planets falling toward the sun\\nin their orbits; the Darwin who out of the thigh bone of an animal was\\nable to construct in his imagination the whole animal and the\\nenvironment in which it must have lived, and so add another page to the\\nearth\\'s history.\\n\\nTHE TWO FACTORS IN IMAGINATION.--From the simple facts which we have\\njust been considering, the conclusion is plain that our power of\\nimagination depends on two factors; namely, (1) _the materials available\\nin the form of usable images capable of recall_, and (2) _our\\nconstructive ability_, or the power to group these images into new\\n_wholes, the process being guided by some purpose or end_. Without this\\nlast provision, the products of our imagination are daydreams with their\\n\"castles in Spain,\" which may be pleasing and proper enough on\\noccasions, but which as an habitual mode of thought are extremely\\ndangerous.\\n\\nIMAGINATION LIMITED BY STOCK OF IMAGES.--That the mind is limited in its\\nimagination by its stock of images may be seen from a simple\\nillustration: Suppose that you own a building made of brick, but that\\nyou find the old one no longer adequate for your needs, and so purpose\\nto build a new one; and suppose, further, that you have no material for\\nyour new building except that contained in the old structure. It is\\nevident that you will be limited in constructing your new building by\\nthe material which was in the old. You may be able to build the new\\nstructure in any one of a multitude of different forms or styles of\\narchitecture, so far as the material at hand will lend itself to that\\nstyle of building, and providing, further, that you are able to make\\nthe plans. But you will always be limited finally by the character and\\namount of material obtainable from the old structure. So with the mind.\\nThe old building is your past experience, and the separate bricks are\\nthe images out of which you must build your new structure through the\\nimagination. Here, as before, nothing can enter which was not already on\\nhand. Nothing goes into the new structure so far as its constructive\\nmaterial is concerned except images, and there is nowhere to get images\\nbut from the results of our past experience.\\n\\nLIMITED ALSO BY OUR CONSTRUCTIVE ABILITY.--But not only is our\\nimaginative output limited by the _amount_ of material in the way of\\nimages which we have at our command, but also and perhaps not less by\\nour _constructive ability_. Many persons might own the old pile of\\nbricks fully adequate for the new structure, and then fail to get the\\nnew because they were unable to construct it. So, many who have had a\\nrich and varied experience in many lines are yet unable to muster their\\nimages of these experiences in such a way that new products are\\nobtainable from them. These have the heavy, draft-horse kind of\\nintellect which goes plodding on, very possibly doing good service in\\nits own circumscribed range, but destined after all to service in the\\nnarrow field with its low, drooping horizon. They are never able to take\\na dash at a two-minute clip among equally swift competitors, or even\\nswing at a good round pace along the pleasant highways of an experience\\nlying beyond the confines of the narrow _here_ and _now_. These are the\\nminds which cannot discover relations; which cannot _think_. Minds of\\nthis type can never be architects of their own fate, or even builders,\\nbut must content themselves to be hod carriers.\\n\\nTHE NEED OF A PURPOSE.--Nor are we to forget that we cannot\\nintelligently erect our building until we know the _purpose_ for which\\nit is to be used. No matter how much building material we may have on\\nhand, nor how skillful an architect we may be, unless our plans are\\nguided by some definite aim, we shall be likely to end with a structure\\nthat is fanciful and useless. Likewise with our thought structure.\\nUnless our imagination is guided by some aim or purpose, we are in\\ndanger of drifting into mere daydreams which not only are useless in\\nfurnishing ideals for the guidance of our lives, but often become\\npositively harmful when grown into a habit. The habit of daydreaming is\\nhard to break, and, continuing, holds our thought in thrall and makes it\\nunwilling to deal with the plain, homely things of everyday life. Who\\nhas not had the experience of an hour or a day spent in a fairyland of\\ndreams, and awakened at the end to find himself rather dissatisfied with\\nthe prosaic round of duties which confronted him! I do not mean to say\\nthat we should _never_ dream; but I know of no more pernicious mental\\nhabit than that of daydreaming carried to excess, for it ends in our\\nfollowing every will-o\\'-the-wisp of fancy, and places us at the mercy of\\nevery chance suggestion.\\n\\n\\n3. TYPES OF IMAGINATION\\n\\nAlthough imagination enters every field of human experience, and busies\\nitself with every line of human interest, yet all its activities can be\\nclassed under two different types. These are (1) _reproductive_, and (2)\\n_creative_ imagination.\\n\\nREPRODUCTIVE IMAGINATION.--Reproductive imagination is the type we use\\nwhen we seek to reproduce in our minds the pictures described by others,\\nor pictures from our own past experience which lack the completeness\\nand fidelity to make them true memory.\\n\\nThe narration or description of the story book, the history or geography\\ntext; the tale of adventure recounted by traveler or hunter; the account\\nof a new machine or other invention; fairy tales and myths--these or any\\nother matter that may be put into words capable of suggesting images to\\nus are the field for reproductive imagination. In this use of the\\nimagination our business is to follow and not lead, to copy and not\\ncreate.\\n\\nCREATIVE IMAGINATION.--But we must have leaders, originators--else we\\nshould but imitate each other and the world would be at a standstill.\\nIndeed, every person, no matter how humble his station or how humdrum\\nhis life, should be in some degree capable of initiative and\\noriginality. Such ability depends in no small measure on the power to\\nuse creative imagination.\\n\\nCreative imagination takes the images from our own past experience or\\nthose gleaned from the work of others and puts them together in new and\\noriginal forms. The inventor, the writer, the mechanic or the artist who\\npossesses the spirit of creation is not satisfied with _mere_\\nreproduction, but seeks to modify, to improve, to originate. True, many\\nimportant inventions and discoveries have come by seeming accident, by\\nbeing stumbled upon. Yet it holds that the person who thus stumbles upon\\nthe discovery or invention is usually one whose creative imagination is\\nactively at work _seeking_ to create or discover in his field. The\\nworld\\'s progress as a whole does not come by accident, but by creative\\nplanning. Creative imagination is always found at the van of progress,\\nwhether in the life of an individual or a nation.\\n\\n\\n4. TRAINING THE IMAGINATION\\n\\nImagination is highly susceptible of cultivation, and its training\\nshould constitute one of the most important aims of education. Every\\nschool subject, but especially such subjects as deal with description\\nand narration--history, literature, geography, nature study and\\nscience--is rich in opportunities for the use of imagination. Skillful\\nteaching will not only find in these subjects a means of training the\\nimagination, but will so employ imagination in their study as to make\\nthem living matter, throbbing with life and action, rather than so many\\ndead words or uninteresting facts.\\n\\nGATHERING OF MATERIAL FOR IMAGINATION.--Theoretically, then, it is not\\nhard to see what we must do to cultivate our imagination. In the first\\nplace, we must take care to secure a large and usable _stock of images_\\nfrom all fields of perception. It is not enough to have visual images\\nalone or chiefly, for many a time shall we need to build structures\\ninvolving all the other senses and the motor activities as well. This\\nmeans that we must have a first-hand contact with just as large an\\nenvironment as possible--large in the world of Nature with all her\\nvaried forms suited to appeal to every avenue of sense; large in our\\ncontact with people in all phases of experience, laughing with those who\\nlaugh and weeping with those who weep; large in contact with books, the\\ninterpreters of the men and events of the past. We must not only let all\\nthese kinds of environment drift in upon us as they may chance to do,\\nbut we must deliberately _seek_ to increase our stock of experience;\\nfor, after all, experience lies at the bottom of imagination as of every\\nother mental process. And not only must we thus put ourselves in the way\\nof acquiring new experience, but we must by recall and reconstruction,\\nas we saw in an earlier discussion, keep our imagery fresh and usable.\\nFor whatever serves to improve our images, at the same time is bettering\\nthe very foundation of imagination.\\n\\nWE MUST NOT FAIL TO BUILD.--In the second place, we must not fail _to\\nbuild_. For it is futile to gather a large supply of images if we let\\nthe material lie unused. How many people there are who put in all their\\ntime gathering material for their structure, and never take time to do\\nthe building! They look and listen and read, and are so fully occupied\\nin absorbing the immediately present that they have no time to see the\\nwider significance of the things with which they deal. They are like the\\nstudents who are too busy studying to have time to think. They are so\\ntaken up with receiving that they never perform the higher act of\\ncombining. They are the plodding fact gatherers, many of them doing good\\nservice, collecting material which the seer and the philosopher, with\\ntheir constructive power, build together into the greater wholes which\\nmake our systems of thought. They are the ones who fondly think that, by\\nreading books full of wild tales and impossible plots, they are training\\ntheir imagination. For them, sober history, no matter how heroic or\\ntragic in its quiet movements, is too tame. They have not the patience\\nto read solid and thoughtful literature, and works of science and\\nphilosophy are a bore. These are the persons who put in all their time\\nin looking at and admiring other people\\'s houses, and never get time to\\ndo any building for themselves.\\n\\nWE SHOULD CARRY OUR IDEALS INTO ACTION.--The best training for the\\nimagination which I know anything about is that to be obtained by taking\\nour own material and from it building our own structure. It is true\\nthat it will help to look through other people\\'s houses enough to\\ndiscover their style of building: we should read. But just as it is not\\nnecessary for us to put in all the time we devote to looking at houses,\\nin inspecting doll houses and Chinese pagodas, so it is not best for us\\nto get all our notions of imaginative structures from the marvelous and\\nthe unreal; we get good training for the imagination from reading\\n\"Hiawatha,\" but so can we from reading the history of the primitive\\nIndian tribes. The pictures in \"Snowbound\" are full of suggestion for\\nthe imagination: but so is the history of the Puritans in New England.\\nBut even with the best of models before us, it is not enough to follow\\nothers\\' building. We must construct stories for ourselves, must work out\\nplots for our own stories; we must have time to meditate and plan and\\nbuild, not idly in the daydream, but purposefully, and then make our\\nimages real by _carrying them out in activity_, if they are of such a\\ncharacter that this is possible; we must build our ideals and work to\\nthem in the common course of our everyday life; we must think for\\nourselves instead of forever following the thinking of others; we must\\n_initiate_ as well as imitate.\\n\\n\\n5. PROBLEMS FOR OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Explain the cause and the remedy in the case of such errors as the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n    Children who defined mountain as land 1,000 or more feet in height\\n    said that the factory smokestack was higher than the mountain\\n    because it \"went straight up\" and the mountain did not.\\n\\n    Children often think of the horizon as fastened to the earth.\\n\\n    Islands are thought of as floating on the water.\\n\\n2. How would you stimulate the imagination of a child who does not seem\\nto picture or make real the descriptions in reading, geography, etc.? Is\\nit possible that such inability may come from an insufficient basis in\\nobservation, and hence in images?\\n\\n3.

Introspection reveals no more\\ninteresting fact concerning our minds than that our thoughts move in a\\nconnected and orderly array and not in a hit-and-miss fashion. Our\\nmental states do not throng the stream of consciousness like so many\\npieces of wood following each other at random down a rushing current,\\nnow this one ahead, now that. On the contrary, our thoughts come, one\\nafter the other, as they are beckoned or _caused_. The thought now in\\nthe focal point of your consciousness appeared because it sprouted out\\nof the one just preceding it; and the present thought, before it\\ndeparts, will determine its successor and lead it upon the scene. This\\nis to say that our thought stream possesses not only a continuity, but\\nalso a _unity_; it has coherence and system. This coherence and system,\\nwhich operates in accordance with definite laws, is brought about by\\nwhat the psychologist calls _association_.\\n\\n\\n1. THE NATURE OF ASSOCIATION\\n\\nWe may define association, then, as the tendency among our thoughts to\\nform such a system of bonds with each other that the objects of\\nconsciousness are vitally connected both (1) as they exist at any given\\nmoment, and (2) as they occur in succession in the mental stream.\\n\\nTHE NEURAL BASIS OF ASSOCIATION.--The association of thoughts--ideas,\\nimages, memory--or of a situation with its response, rests primarily on\\na neural basis. Association is the result of habit working in neurone\\ngroups. Its fundamental law is stated by James as follows: \"When two\\nelementary brain-processes have been active together or in immediate\\nsuccession, one of them, on recurring, tends to propagate its excitement\\ninto the other.\" This is but a technical statement of the simple fact\\nthat nerve currents flow most easily over the neurone connections that\\nthey have already used.\\n\\nIt is hard to teach an old dog new tricks, because the old tricks employ\\nfamiliar, much-used neural paths, while new tricks require the\\nconnecting up of groups of neurones not in the habit of working\\ntogether; and the flow of nerve energy is more easily accomplished in\\nthe neurones accustomed to working together. One who learns to speak a\\nforeign language late in life never attains the facility and ease that\\nmight have been reached at an earlier age. This is because the neural\\npaths for speech are already set for his mother-tongue, and, with the\\nlessened plasticity of age, the new paths are hard to establish.\\n\\nThe connections between the various brain areas, or groups of neurones,\\nare, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, accomplished by means of\\n_association fibers_. This function requires millions of neurones, which\\nunite every part of the cortex with every other part, thus making it\\npossible for a neural activity going on in any particular center to\\nextend to any other center whatsoever. In the relatively unripe brain of\\nthe child, the association fibers have not yet set up most of their\\nconnections. The age at which memory begins is determined chiefly by\\nthe development of a sufficient number of association fibers to bring\\nabout recall. The more complex reasoning, which requires many different\\nassociative connections, is impossible prior to the existence of\\nadequate neural development. It is this fact that makes it futile to\\nattempt to teach young children the more complicated processes of\\narithmetic, grammar, or other subjects. They are not yet equipped with\\nthe requisite brain machinery to grasp the necessary associations.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Diagrammatic scheme of association, in which V\\nstands for the visual, A for the auditory, G for the gustatory, M for\\nthe motor, and T for the thought and feeling centers of the cortex.]\\n\\nASSOCIATION THE BASIS OF MEMORY.--Without the machinery and processes of\\nassociation we could have no memory. Let us see in a simple illustration\\nhow association works in recall. Suppose you are passing an orchard and\\nsee a tree loaded with tempting apples. You hesitate, then climb the\\nfence, pick an apple and eat it, hearing the owner\\'s dog bark as you\\nleave the place. The accompanying diagram will illustrate roughly the\\ncenters of the cortex which were involved in the act, and the\\nassociation fibers which connect them. (See Fig. 18.) Now let us see\\nhow you may afterward remember the circumstance through association. Let\\nus suppose that a week later you are seated at your dining table, and\\nthat you begin to eat an apple whose flavor reminds you of the one which\\nyou plucked from the tree. From this start how may the entire\\ncircumstance be recalled? Remember that the cortical centers connected\\nwith the sight of the apple tree, with our thoughts about it, with our\\nmovements in getting the apple, and with hearing the dog bark, were all\\nactive together with the taste center, and hence tend to be thrown into\\nactivity again from its activity. It is easy to see that we may (1) get\\na visual image of the apple tree and its fruit from a current over the\\ngustatory-visual association fibers; (2) the thoughts, emotions, or\\ndeliberations which we had on the former occasion may again recur to us\\nfrom a current over the gustatory-thought neurones; (3) we may get an\\nimage of our movements in climbing the fence and picking the apple from\\na current over the gustatory-motor fibers; or (4) we may get an auditory\\nimage of the barking of the dog from a current over the\\ngustatory-auditory fibers. Indeed, we are _sure_ to get some one or more\\nof these unless the paths are blocked in some way, or our attention\\nleads off in some other direction.\\n\\nFACTORS DETERMINING DIRECTION OF RECALL.--_Which_ of these we get first,\\nwhich of the images the taste percept calls to take its place as it\\ndrops out of consciousness, will depend, other things being equal, on\\nwhich center was most keenly active in the original situation, and is at\\nthe moment most permeable. If, at the time we were eating the stolen\\nfruit, our thoughts were keenly self-accusing for taking the apples\\nwithout permission, then the current will probably discharge through\\nthe path gustatory-thought, and we shall recall these thoughts and their\\naccompanying feelings. But if it chances that the barking of the dog\\nfrightened us badly, then more likely the discharge from the taste\\ncenter will be along the path gustatory-auditory, and we shall get the\\nauditory image of the dog\\'s barking, which in turn may call up a visual\\nimage of his savage appearance over the auditory-visual fibers. It is\\nclear, however, that, given any one of the elements of the entire\\nsituation back, the rest are potentially possible to us, and any one may\\nserve as a \"cue\" to call up all the rest. Whether, given the starting\\npoint, we get them all, depends solely on whether the paths are\\nsufficiently open between them for the current to discharge between\\nthem, granting that the first experience made sufficient impression to\\nbe retained.\\n\\nSince this simple illustration may be made infinitely complex by means\\nof the millions of fibers which connect every center in the cortex with\\nevery other center, and since, in passing from one experience to another\\nin the round of our daily activities, these various areas are all\\ninvolved in an endless chain of activities so intimately related that\\neach one can finally lead to all the others, we have here the machinery\\nboth of retention and of recall--the mechanism by which our past may be\\nmade to serve the present through being reproduced in the form of memory\\nimages or ideas. Through this machinery we are unable to escape our\\npast, whether it be good or bad; for both the good and the bad alike are\\nbrought back to us through its operations.\\n\\nWhen the repetition of a series of acts has rendered habit secure, the\\nassociation is relatively certain. If I recite to you A-B-C-D, your\\nthought at once runs on to E, F, G. If I repeat, \"Tell me not in\\nmournful numbers,\" association leads you to follow with \"Life is but an\\nempty dream.\" Your neurone groups are accustomed to act in this way, so\\nthe sequence follows. Memorizing anything from the multiplication table\\nto the most beautiful gems of poetic fervor consists, therefore, in the\\nsetting up of the right associative connections in the brain.\\n\\nASSOCIATION IN THINKING.--All thinking proceeds by the discovery or\\nrecognition of relations between the terms or objects of our thought.\\nThe science of mathematics rests on the relations found to exist between\\nnumbers and quantities. The principles and laws of natural science are\\nbased on the relations established among the different forms of matter\\nand the energy that operates in this field. So also in the realm of\\nhistory, art, ethics, or any other field of human experience. Each fact\\nor event must be linked to other facts or events before it possesses\\nsignificance. Association therefore lies at the foundation of all\\nthinking, whether that of the original thinker who is creating our\\nsciences, planning and executing the events of history, evolving a\\nsystem of ethics, or whether one is only learning these fields as they\\nalready exist by means of study. Other things being equal, he is the\\nbest thinker who has his knowledge related part to part so that the\\nwhole forms a unified and usable system.\\n\\nASSOCIATION AND ACTION.--Association plays an equally important part in\\nall our motor responses, the acts by which we carry on our daily lives,\\ndo our work and our play, or whatever else may be necessary in meeting\\nand adapting ourselves to our environment. Some sensations are often\\nrepeated, and demand practically the same response each time. In such\\ncases the associations soon become fixed, and the response certain and\\nautomatic. For example, we sit at the table, and the response of eating\\nfollows, with all its complex acts, as a matter of course. We lie down\\nin bed, and the response of sleep comes. We take our place at the piano,\\nand our fingers produce the accustomed music.\\n\\nIt is of course obvious that the influence of association extends to\\nmoral action as well. In general, our conduct follows the trend of\\nestablished associations. We are likely to do in great moral crises\\nabout as we are in the habit of doing in small ones.\\n\\n\\n2. THE TYPES OF ASSOCIATION\\n\\nFUNDAMENTAL LAW OF ASSOCIATION.--Stated on the physiological side, the\\nlaw of habit as set forth in the definition of association in the\\npreceding section includes all the laws of association. In different\\nphrasing we may say: (1) Neurone groups accustomed to acting together\\nhave the tendency to work in unison. (2) The more frequently such groups\\nact together the stronger will be the tendency for one to throw the\\nother into action. Also, (3) the more intense the excitement or tension\\nunder which they act together the stronger will be the tendency for\\nactivity in one to bring about activity in the other.\\n\\nThe corresponding facts may be expressed in psychological terms as\\nfollows: (1) Facts accustomed to being associated together in the mind\\nhave a tendency to reappear together. (2) The more frequently these\\nfacts appear together the stronger the tendency for the presence of one\\nto insure the presence of the other. (3) The greater the tension,\\nexcitement or concentration when these facts appear in conjunction with\\neach other, the more certain the presence of one is to cause the\\npresence of the other.\\n\\nSeveral different types of association have been differentiated by\\npsychologists from Aristotle down. It is to be kept in mind, however,\\nthat all association types _go back to the elementary law of\\nhabit-connections among the neurones_ for their explanation.\\n\\nASSOCIATION BY CONTIGUITY.--The recurrence in our minds of many of the\\nelements from our past experience is due to the fact that at some time,\\npossibly at many times, the recurring facts were contiguous in\\nconsciousness with some other element or fact which happens now to be\\nagain present. All have had the experience of meeting some person whom\\nwe had not seen for several months or years, and having a whole series\\nof supposedly forgotten incidents or events connected with our former\\nassociations flood into the mind. Things we did, topics we discussed,\\ntrips we took, games we played, now recur at the renewal of our\\nacquaintance. For these are the things that were contiguous in our\\nconsciousness with our sense of the personality and appearance of our\\nfriend. And who has not in similar fashion had a whiff of perfume or the\\nstrains of a song recall to him his childhood days! Contiguity is again\\nthe explanation.\\n\\nAT THE MERCY OF OUR ASSOCIATIONS.--Through the law thus operating we are\\nin a sense at the mercy of our associations, which may be bad as well as\\ngood. We may form certain lines of interest to guide our thought, and\\nattention may in some degree direct it, but one\\'s mental make-up is,\\nafter all, largely dependent on the character of his associations. Evil\\nthoughts, evil memories, evil imaginations--these all come about through\\nthe association of unworthy or impure images along with the good in our\\nstream of thought. We may try to forget the base deed and banish it\\nforever from our thinking, but lo! in an unguarded moment the nerve\\ncurrent shoots into the old path, and the impure thought flashes into\\nthe mind, unsought and unwelcomed. Every young man who thinks he must\\nindulge in a little sowing of wild oats before he settles down to a\\ncorrect life, and so deals in unworthy thoughts and deeds, is putting a\\nmortgage on his future; for he will find the inexorable machinery of his\\nnervous system grinding the hated images of such things back into his\\nmind as surely as the mill returns to the sack of the miller what he\\nfeeds into the hopper. He may refuse to harbor these thoughts, but he\\ncan no more hinder their seeking admission to his mind than he can\\nprevent the tramp from knocking at his door. He may drive such images\\nfrom his mind the moment they are discovered, and indeed is guilty if he\\ndoes not; but not taking offense at this rebuff, the unwelcome thought\\nagain seeks admission.\\n\\nThe only protection against the return of the undesirable associations\\nis to choose lines of thought as little related to them as possible. But\\neven then, do the best we may, an occasional \"connection\" will be set\\nup, we know not how, and the unwelcome image stands staring us in the\\nface, as the corpse of Eugene Aram\\'s victim confronted him at every\\nturn, though he thought it safely buried. A minister of my acquaintance\\ntells me that in the holiest moments of his most exalted thought, images\\nrise in his mind which he loathes, and from which he recoils in horror.\\nNot only does he drive them away at once, but he seeks to lock and bar\\nthe door against them by firmly resolving that he will never think of\\nthem again. But alas! that is beyond his control. The tares have been\\nsown among the wheat, and will persist along with it until the end. In\\nhis boyhood these images were given into the keeping of his brain cells,\\nand they are only being faithful to their trust.\\n\\nASSOCIATION BY SIMILARITY AND CONTRAST.--All are familiar with the fact\\nthat like tends to suggest like. One friend reminds us of another friend\\nwhen he manifests similar traits of character, shows the same tricks of\\nmanner, or has the same peculiarities of speech or gesture. The telling\\nof a ghost or burglar story in a company will at once suggest a similar\\nstory to every person of the group, and before we know it the\\nconversation has settled down to ghosts or burglars. One boastful boy is\\nenough to start the gang to recounting their real or imaginary exploits.\\nGood and beautiful thoughts tend to call up other good and beautiful\\nthoughts, while evil thoughts are likely to produce after their own\\nkind; like produces like.\\n\\nAnother form of relationship is, however, quite as common as similars in\\nour thinking. In certain directions we naturally think in _opposites_.\\nBlack suggests white, good suggests bad, fat suggests lean, wealth\\nsuggests poverty, happiness suggests sorrow, and so on.\\n\\nThe tendency of our thought thus to group in similars and opposites is\\nclear when we go back to the fundamental law of association. The fact is\\nthat we more frequently assemble our thoughts in these ways than in\\nhaphazard relations. We habitually group similars together, or compare\\nopposites in our thinking; hence these are the terms between which\\nassociative bonds are formed.\\n\\nPARTIAL, OR SELECTIVE, ASSOCIATION.--The past is never wholly reinstated\\nin present consciousness. Many elements, because they had formed fewer\\nassociations, or because they find some obstacle to recall, are\\npermanently dropped out and forgotten. In other words, association is\\nalways _selective_, favoring now this item of experience, now that,\\nabove the rest.\\n\\nIt is well that this is so; for to be unable to escape from the great\\nmass of minutiæ and unimportant detail in one\\'s past would be\\nintolerable, and would so cumber the mind with useless rubbish as to\\ndestroy its usefulness. We have surely all had some experience with the\\ntype of persons whose associations are so complete and impartial that\\nall their conversation teems with unessential and irrelevant details.\\nThey cannot recount the simplest incident in its essential points but,\\nslaves to literalness, make themselves insufferable bores by entering\\nupon every lane and by-path of circumstance that leads nowhere and\\nmatters not the least in their story. Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot,\\nShakespeare, and many other writers have seized upon such characters and\\nmade use of them for their comic effect. James, in illustrating this\\nmental type, has quoted the following from Miss Austen\\'s \"Emma\":\\n\\n\"\\'But where could _you_ hear it?\\' cried Miss Bates. \\'Where could you\\npossibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\\nreceived Mrs. Cole\\'s note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at least\\nten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out--I\\nwas only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane was\\nstanding in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was so\\nafraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would\\ngo down and see, and Jane said: \"Shall I go down instead? for I think\\nyou have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.\" \"Oh, my\\ndear,\" said I--well, and just then came the note.\\'\"\\n\\nTHE REMEDY.--The remedy for such wearisome and fruitless methods of\\nassociation is, as a matter of theory, simple and easy. It is to\\nemphasize, intensify, and dwell upon the _significant and essential_ in\\nour thinking. The person who listens to a story, who studies a lesson,\\nor who is a participant in any event must apply a _sense of value_,\\nrecognizing and fixing the important and relegating the trivial and\\nunimportant to their proper level. Not to train one\\'s self to think in\\nthis discriminating way is much like learning to play a piano by\\nstriking each key with equal force!\\n\\n\\n3. TRAINING IN ASSOCIATION\\n\\nSince association is at bottom nothing but habit at work in the mental\\nprocesses, it follows that it, like other forms of habit, can be\\nencouraged or suppressed by training. Certainly, no part of one\\'s\\neducation is of greater importance than the character of his\\nassociations. For upon these will largely depend not alone the _content_\\nof his mental stream, the stuff of his thinking, but also its\\n_organization_, or the use made of the thought material at hand. In\\nfact, the whole science of education rests on the laws and principles\\ninvolved in setting up right systems of associative connections in the\\nindividual.\\n\\nTHE PLEASURE-PAIN MOTIVE IN ASSOCIATION.--A general law seems to obtain\\nthroughout the animal world that associative responses accompanied by\\npleasure tend to persist and grow stronger, while those accompanied by\\npain tend to weaken and fall away. The little child of two years may not\\nunderstand the gravity of the offense in tearing the leaves out of\\nbooks, but if its hands are sharply spatted whenever they tear a book,\\nthe association between the sight of books and tearing them will soon\\ncease. In fact, all punishment should have for its object the use of\\npain in the breaking of associative bonds between certain situations and\\nwrong responses to them.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the dog that is being trained to perform his tricks\\nis rewarded with a tidbit or a pat when the right response has been\\nmade. In this way the bond for this particular act is strengthened\\nthrough the use of pleasure. All matter studied and learned under the\\nstimulus of good feeling, enthusiasm, or a pleasurable sense of victory\\nand achievement not only tends to set up more permanent and valuable\\nassociations than if learned under opposite conditions, but it also\\nexerts a stronger appeal to our interest and appreciation.\\n\\nThe influence of mental attitude on the matter we study raises a\\nquestion as to the wisdom of assigning the committing of poetry, or\\nBible verses, or the reading of so many pages of a literary masterpiece\\nas a punishment for some offense. How many of us have carried away\\nassociations of dislike and bitterness toward some gem of verse or prose\\nor Scripture because of having our learning of it linked up with the\\nthought of an imposed task set as penance for wrong-doing! One person\\ntells me that to this day she hates the sight of Tennyson because this\\nwas the volume from which she was assigned many pages to commit in\\natonement for her youthful delinquencies.\\n\\nINTEREST AS A BASIS FOR ASSOCIATION.--Associations established under the\\nstimulus of strong interest are relatively broad and permanent, while\\nthose formed with interest flagging are more narrow and of doubtful\\npermanence. This statement is, of course, but a particular application\\nof the law of attention. Interest brings the whole self into action.\\nUnder its urging the mind is active and alert. The new facts learned are\\ncompletely registered, and are assimilated to other facts to which they\\nare related. Many associative connections are formed, hence the new\\nmatter is more certain of recall, and possesses more significance and\\nmeaning.\\n\\nASSOCIATION AND METHODS OF LEARNING.--The number and quality of our\\nassociations depends in no small degree on our methods of learning. We\\nmay be satisfied merely to impress what we learn on our memory,\\ncommitting it uncritically as so many facts to be stored away as a part\\nof our education. We may go a step beyond this and grasp the simplest\\nand most obvious meanings, but not seek for the deeper and more\\nfundamental relations. We may learn separate sections or divisions of a\\nsubject, accepting each as a more or less complete unit, without\\nconnecting these sections and divisions into a logical whole.\\n\\nBut all such methods are a mistake. They do not provide for the\\nassociative bonds between the various facts or groups of facts in our\\nknowledge, without which our facts are in danger of becoming but so much\\nlumber in the mind. Meanings, relations, definitely recognized\\nassociations, should attach to all that we learn. Better far a smaller\\namount of _usable_ knowledge than any quantity of unorganized and\\nundigested information, even if the latter sometimes allows us to pass\\nexaminations and receive honor grades. In short, real mastery demands\\nthat we _think_, that is _relate_ and _associate_, instead of merely\\n_absorbing_ as we learn.\\n\\n\\n4. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Test the uncontrolled associations of a group of pupils by\\npronouncing to the class some word, as _blue_, and having the members\\nwrite down 20 words in succession as rapidly as they can, taking in each\\ninstance the first word that occurs to them. The difference in the\\nscope, or range, of associations, can easily be studied by applying this\\ntest to, say, a fourth grade and an eighth grade and then comparing\\nresults.\\n\\n2. Have you ever been puzzled by the appearance in your mind of some\\nfact or incident not thought of before for years? Were you able to trace\\nout the associative connection that caused the fact to appear? Why are\\nwe sometimes unable to recall, when we need them, facts that we\\nperfectly well know?\\n\\n3. You have observed that it is possible to be able to spell certain\\nwords when they occur in a spelling lesson, but to miss them when\\nemploying them in composition. It is possible to learn a conjugation or\\na declension in tabular form, and then not be able to use the correct\\nforms of words in speech or writing. Relate these facts to the laws of\\nassociation, and recommend a method of instruction that will remove the\\ndiscrepancy.\\n\\n4. To test the quickness of association in a class of children, copy the\\nfollowing words clearly in a vertical column on a chart; have your class\\nall ready at a given signal; then display the chart before them for\\nsixty seconds, asking them to write down on paper the exact _opposite_\\nof as many words as possible in one minute. Be sure that all know just\\nwhat they are expected to do.\\n\\n     Bad, inside, slow, short, little, soft, black, dark, sad, true,\\n     dislike, poor, well, sorry, thick, full, peace, few, below, enemy.\\n\\n     Count the number of correct opposites got by each pupil.\\n\\n5. Can you think of garrulous persons among your acquaintance the\\nexplanation of whose tiresomeness is that their association is of the\\n_complete_ instead of the _selective_ type? Watch for such illustrations\\nin conversation and in literature (e.g., Juliet\\'s nurse).\\n\\n6. Observe children in the schoolroom for good and poor training in\\nassociation. Have you ever had anything that you otherwise presumably\\nwould enjoy rendered distasteful because of unpleasant associations?\\nPass your own methods of learning in review, and also inquire into the\\nmethods used by children in study, to determine whether they are\\nresulting in the best possible use of association.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nMEMORY\\n\\n\\nEvery hour of our lives we call upon memory to supply us with some fact\\nor detail from out our past. Let memory wholly fail us, and we find\\nourselves helpless and out of joint in a world we fail to understand. A\\npoor memory handicaps one in the pursuit of education, hampers him in\\nbusiness or professional success, and puts him at a disadvantage in\\nevery relation of life. On the other hand, a good memory is an asset on\\nwhich the owner realizes anew each succeeding day.\\n\\n\\n1. THE NATURE OF MEMORY\\n\\nNow that you come to think of it, you can recall perfectly well that\\nColumbus discovered America in 1492; that your house is painted white;\\nthat it rained a week ago today. But where were these once-known facts,\\nnow remembered so easily, while they were out of your mind? Where did\\nthey stay while you were not thinking of them? The common answer is,\\n\"Stored away in my memory.\" Yet no one believes that the memory is a\\nwarehouse of facts which we pack away there when we for a time have no\\nuse for them, as we store away our old furniture.\\n\\nWHAT IS RETAINED.--The truth is that the simple question I asked you is\\nby no means an easy one, and I will answer it myself by asking you an\\neasier one: As we sit with the sunlight streaming into our room, where\\nis the darkness which filled it last night? And where will all this\\nlight be at midnight tonight? Answer these questions, and the ones I\\nasked about your remembered facts will be answered. While it is true\\nthat, regardless of the conditions in our little room, darkness still\\nexists wherever there is no light, and light still exists wherever there\\nis no darkness, yet for this particular room _there is no darkness when\\nthe sun shines in_, and _there is no light when the room is filled with\\ndarkness_. So in the case of a remembered fact. Although the fact that\\nColumbus discovered America some four hundred years ago, that your house\\nis of a white color, that it rained a week ago today, exists as a fact\\nregardless of whether your minds think of these things at all, yet the\\ntruth remains as before: for the particular mind which remembers these\\nthings, _the facts did not exist while they were out of the mind_.\\n\\n_It is not the remembered fact which is retained_, BUT THE POWER TO\\nREPRODUCE THE FACT WHEN WE REQUIRE IT.\\n\\nTHE PHYSICAL BASIS OF MEMORY.--The power to reproduce a once-known fact\\ndepends ultimately on the brain. This is not hard to understand if we go\\nback a little and consider that brain activity was concerned in every\\nperception we have ever had, and in every fact we have ever known.\\nIndeed, it was through a certain neural activity of the cortex that you\\nwere able originally to know that Columbus discovered America, that your\\nhouse is white, and that it rained on a day in the past. Without this\\ncortical activity, these facts would have existed just as truly, but\\n_you_ would never have known them. Without this neural activity in the\\nbrain there is no consciousness, and to it we must look for the\\nrecurrence in consciousness of remembered facts, as well as for those\\nwhich appear for the first time.\\n\\nHOW WE REMEMBER.--Now, if we are to have a once-known fact repeated in\\nconsciousness, or in other words _remembered_, what we must do on the\\nphysiological side is to provide for a repetition of the neural activity\\nwhich was at first responsible for the fact\\'s appearing in\\nconsciousness. The mental accompaniment of the repeated activity _is the\\nmemory_. Thus, as _memory is the approximate repetition of\\nonce-experienced mental states or facts, together with the recognition\\nof their belonging to our past, so it is accomplished by an approximate\\nrepetition of the once-performed neural process in the cortex which\\noriginally accompanied these states or facts_.\\n\\nThe part played by the brain in memory makes it easy to understand why\\nwe find it so impossible to memorize or to recall when the brain is\\nfatigued from long hours of work or lack of sleep. It also explains the\\nderangement in memory that often comes from an injury to the brain, or\\nfrom the toxins of alcohol, drugs or disease.\\n\\nDEPENDENCE OF MEMORY ON BRAIN QUALITY.--Differences in memory ability,\\nwhile depending in part on the training memory receives, rest ultimately\\non the memory-quality of the brain. James tells us that four distinct\\ntypes of brains may be distinguished, and he describes them as follows:\\n\\nBrains that are:\\n\\n    (1) Like _marble_ to receive and like _marble_ to retain.\\n    (2) Like _wax_ to receive and like _wax_ to retain.\\n    (3) Like _marble_ to receive and like _wax_ to retain.\\n    (4) Like _wax_ to receive and like _marble_ to retain.\\n\\nThe first type gives us those who memorize slowly and with much heroic\\neffort, but who keep well what they have committed. The second type\\nrepresents the ones who learn in a flash, who can cram up a lesson in a\\nfew minutes, but who forget as easily and as quickly as they learn. The\\nthird type characterizes the unfortunates who must labor hard and long\\nfor what they memorize, only to see it quickly slipping from their\\ngrasp. The fourth type is a rare boon to its possessor, enabling him\\neasily to stock his memory with valuable material, which is readily\\navailable to him upon demand.\\n\\nThe particular type of brain we possess is given us through heredity,\\nand we can do little or nothing to change the type. Whatever our type of\\nbrain, however, we can do much to improve our memory by obeying the laws\\nupon which all good memory depends.\\n\\n\\n2. THE FOUR FACTORS INVOLVED IN MEMORY\\n\\nNothing is more obvious than that memory cannot return to us what has\\nnever been given into its keeping, what has not been retained, or what\\nfor any reason cannot be recalled. Further, if the facts given back by\\nmemory are not recognized as belonging to our past, memory would be\\nincomplete. Memory, therefore, involves the following four factors: (1)\\n_registration_, (2) _retention_, (3) _recall_, (4) _recognition_.\\n\\nREGISTRATION.--By registration we mean the learning or committing of the\\nmatter to be remembered. On the brain side this involves producing in\\nthe appropriate neurones the activities which, when repeated again\\nlater, cause the fact to be recalled. It is this process that\\nconstitutes what we call \"impressing the facts upon the brain.\"\\n\\nNothing is more fatal to good memory than partial or faulty\\nregistration. A thing but half learned is sure to be forgotten. We\\noften stop in the mastery of a lesson just short of the full impression\\nneeded for permanent retention and sure recall. We sometimes say to our\\nteachers, \"I cannot remember,\" when, as a matter of fact, we have never\\nlearned the thing we seek to recall.\\n\\nRETENTION.--Retention, as we have already seen, resides primarily in the\\nbrain. It is accomplished through the law of habit working in the\\nneurones of the cortex. Here, as elsewhere, habit makes an activity once\\nperformed more easy of performance each succeeding time. Through this\\nlaw a neural activity once performed tends to be repeated; or, in other\\nwords, a fact once known in consciousness tends to be remembered. That\\nso large a part of our past is lost in oblivion, and out of the reach of\\nour memory, is probably much more largely due to a failure to _recall_\\nthan to _retain_. We say that we have forgotten a fact or a name which\\nwe cannot recall, try as hard as we may; yet surely all have had the\\nexperience of a long-striven-for fact suddenly appearing in our memory\\nwhen we had given it up and no longer had use for it. It was retained\\nall the time, else it never could have come back at all.\\n\\nAn aged man of my acquaintance lay on his deathbed. In his childhood he\\nhad first learned to speak German; but, moving with his family when he\\nwas eight or nine years of age to an English-speaking community, he had\\nlost his ability to speak German, and had been unable for a third of a\\ncentury to carry on a conversation in his mother tongue. Yet during the\\nlast days of his sickness he lost almost wholly the power to use the\\nEnglish language, and spoke fluently in German. During all these years\\nhis brain paths had retained the power to reproduce the forgotten words,\\neven though for so long a time the words could not be recalled. James\\nquotes a still more striking case of an aged woman who was seized with a\\nfever and, during her delirious ravings, was heard talking in Latin,\\nHebrew and Greek. She herself could neither read nor write, and the\\npriests said she was possessed of a devil. But a physician unraveled the\\nmystery. When the girl was nine years of age, a pastor, who was a noted\\nscholar, had taken her into his home as a servant, and she had remained\\nthere until his death. During this time she had daily heard him read\\naloud from his books in these languages. Her brain had indelibly\\nretained the record made upon it, although for years she could not have\\nrecalled a sentence, if, indeed, she had ever been able to do so.\\n\\nRECALL.--Recall depends entirely on association. There is no way to\\narrive at a certain fact or name that is eluding us except by means of\\nsome other facts, names, or what-not so related to the missing term as\\nto be able to bring it into the fold. Memory arrives at any desired fact\\nonly over a bridge of associations. It therefore follows that the more\\nassociations set up between the fact to be remembered and related facts\\nalready in the mind, the more certain the recall. Historical dates and\\nevents should when learned be associated with important central dates\\nand events to which they naturally attach. Geographical names, places or\\nother information should be connected with related material already in\\nthe mind. Scientific knowledge should form a coherent and related whole.\\nIn short, everything that is given over to the memory for its keeping\\nshould be linked as closely as possible to material of the same sort.\\nThis is all to say that we should not expect our memory to retain and\\nreproduce isolated, unrelated facts, but should give it the advantage\\nof as many logical and well grounded associations as possible.\\n\\nRECOGNITION.--A fact reproduced by memory but not recognized as\\nbelonging to our past experience would impress us as a new fact. This\\nwould mean that memory would fail to link the present to the past. Often\\nwe are puzzled to know whether we have before met a certain person, or\\non a former occasion told a certain story, or previously experienced a\\ncertain present state of mind which seems half familiar. Such baffling\\nmental states are usually but instances of partial and incomplete\\nrecognition. Recognition no longer applies to much of our knowledge; for\\nexample, we say we remember that four times six is twenty-four, but\\nprobably none of us can recall when and where we learned this fact--we\\ncannot _recognize_ it as belonging to our past experience. So with ten\\nthousand other things, which we _know_ rather than remember in the\\nstrict sense.\\n\\n\\n3. THE STUFF OF MEMORY\\n\\nWhat are the forms in which memory presents the past to us? What are the\\nelements with which it deals? What is the stuff of which it consists?\\n\\nIMAGES AS THE MATERIAL OF MEMORY.--In the light of our discussion upon\\nmental imagery, and with the aid of a little introspection, the answer\\nis easy. I ask you to remember your home, and at once a visual image of\\nthe familiar house, with its well-known rooms and their characteristic\\nfurnishings, comes to your mind. I ask you to remember the last concert\\nyou attended, or the chorus of birds you heard recently in the woods;\\nand there comes a flood of images, partly visual, but largely auditory,\\nfrom the melodies you heard. Or I ask you to remember the feast of\\nwhich you partook yesterday, and gustatory and olfactory images are\\nprominent among the others which appear. And so I might keep on until I\\nhad covered the whole range of your memory; and, whether I ask you for\\nthe simple trivial experiences of your past, for the tragic or crucial\\nexperiences, or for the most abstruse and abstract facts which you know\\nand can recall, the case is the same: much of what memory presents to\\nyou comes in the form of _images_ or of _ideas_ of your past.\\n\\nIMAGES VARY AS TO TYPE.--We do not all remember what we call the same\\nfact in like images or ideas. When you remembered that Columbus\\ndiscovered America in 1492, some of you had an image of Columbus the\\nmariner standing on the deck of his ship, as the old picture shows him;\\nand accompanying this image was an idea of \"long agoness.\" Others, in\\nrecalling the same fact, had an image of the coast on which he landed,\\nand perchance felt the rocking of the boat and heard it scraping on the\\nsand as it neared the shore. And still others saw on the printed page\\nthe words stating that Columbus discovered America in 1492. And so in an\\ninfinite variety of images or ideas we may remember what we call the\\nsame fact, though of course the fact is not really the same fact to any\\ntwo of us, nor to any one of us when it comes to us on different\\noccasions in different images.\\n\\nOTHER MEMORY MATERIAL.--But sensory images are not the only material\\nwith which memory has to deal. We may also recall the bare fact that it\\nrained a week ago today without having images of the rain. We may recall\\nthat Columbus discovered America in 1492 without visual or other images\\nof the event. As a matter of fact we do constantly recall many facts of\\nabstract nature, such as mathematical or scientific formulæ with no\\nimagery other than that of the words or symbols, if indeed these be\\npresent. Memory may therefore use as its stuff not only images, but also\\na wide range of facts, ideas and meanings of all sorts.\\n\\n\\n4. LAWS UNDERLYING MEMORY\\n\\nThe development of a good memory depends in no small degree on the\\ncloseness with which we follow certain well-demonstrated laws.\\n\\nTHE LAW OF ASSOCIATION.--The law of association, as we have already\\nseen, is fundamental. Upon it the whole structure of memory depends.\\nStating this law in neural terms we may say: Brain areas which are\\n_active together at the same time tend to establish associative paths_,\\nso that when one of them is again active the other is also brought into\\nactivity. Expressing the same truth in mental terms: If two facts or\\nexperiences _occur together in consciousness_, and one of them is later\\nrecalled, it tends to cause the other to appear also.\\n\\nTHE LAW OF REPETITION.--The law of repetition is but a restatement of\\nthe law of habit, and may be formulated as follows: The _more\\nfrequently_ a certain cortical activity occurs, the more easily is its\\nrepetition brought about. Stating this law in mental terms we may say:\\nThe more often a fact is recalled in consciousness the easier and more\\ncertain the recall becomes. It is upon the law of repetition that\\nreviews and drills to fix things in the memory are based.\\n\\nTHE LAW OF RECENCY.--We may state the law of recency in physiological\\nterms as follows: The _more recently_ brain centers have been employed\\nin a certain activity, the more easily are they thrown into the same\\nactivity. This, on the mental side, means: The more recently any facts\\nhave been present in consciousness the more easily are they recalled. It\\nis in obedience to this law that we want to rehearse a difficult lesson\\njust before the recitation hour, or cram immediately before an\\nexamination. The working of this law also explains the tendency of all\\nmemories to fade out as the years pass by.\\n\\nTHE LAW OF VIVIDNESS.--The law of vividness is of primary importance in\\nmemorizing. On the physical side it may be expressed as follows: The\\n_higher the tension_ or the more intense the activity of neural centers\\nthe more easily the activity is repeated. The counterpart of this law in\\nmental terms is: _The higher the degree of attention_ or concentration\\nwhen the fact is registered the more certain it is of recall. Better far\\none impression of a high degree of vividness than several repetitions\\nwith the attention wandering or the brain too fatigued to respond. Not\\ndrill alone, but drill with concentration, is necessary to sure\\nmemory,--in proof of which witness the futile results on the part of the\\nsmall boy who \"studies his spelling lesson over fifteen times,\" the\\nwhile he is at the same time counting his marbles.\\n\\n\\n5. RULES FOR USING THE MEMORY\\n\\nMuch careful and fruitful experimentation in the field of memory has\\ntaken place in recent years. The scientists are now able to give us\\ncertain simple rules which we can employ in using our memories, even if\\nwe lack the time or opportunity to follow all their technical\\ndiscussions.\\n\\nWHOLES VERSUS PARTS.--Probably most people in setting to work to commit\\nto memory a poem, oration, or other such material, have a tendency to\\nlearn it first by stanzas or sections and then put the parts together to\\nform the whole. Many tests, however, have shown this to be a less\\neffective method than to go over the whole poem or oration time after\\ntime, finally giving special attention to any particularly difficult\\nplaces. The only exception to this rule would seem to be in the case of\\nvery long productions, which may be broken up into sections of\\nreasonable length. The method of committing by wholes instead of parts\\nnot only economizes time and effort in the learning, but also gives a\\nbetter sense of unity and meaning to the matter memorized.\\n\\nRATE OF FORGETTING.--The rate of forgetting is found to be very much\\nmore rapid immediately following the learning than after a longer time\\nhas elapsed. This is to say that of what one is going to forget of\\nmatter committed to memory approximately one-half will fall away within\\nthe first twenty-four hours and three-fourths within the first three\\ndays. Since it is always economy to fix afresh matter that is fading out\\nbefore it has been wholly forgotten, it will manifestly pay to review\\nimportant memory material within the first day or two after it has once\\nbeen memorized.\\n\\nDIVIDED PRACTICE.--If to commit a certain piece of material we must go\\nover it, say, ten different times, the results are found to be much\\nbetter when the entire number of repetitions are not had in immediate\\nsuccession, but with reasonable intervals between. This is due, no\\ndoubt, to the well-known fact that associations tend to take form and\\ngrow more secure even after we have ceased to think specifically of the\\nmatter in hand. The intervals allow time for the associations to form\\ntheir connections. It is in this sense that James says we \"learn to swim\\nduring the winter and to skate during the summer.\"\\n\\nFORCING THE MEMORY TO ACT.--In committing matter by reading it, the\\nmemory should be forced into activity just as fast as it is able to\\ncarry part of the material. If, after reading a poem over once, parts of\\nit can be repeated without reference to the text, the memory should be\\ncompelled to reproduce these parts. So with all other material.\\nRe-reading should be applied only at such points as the memory has not\\nyet grasped.\\n\\nNOT A MEMORY, BUT MEMORIES.--Professor James has emphasized the fact,\\nwhich has often been demonstrated by experimental tests, that we do not\\npossess a memory, but a collection of memories. Our memory may be very\\ngood in one line and poor in another. Nor can we \"train our memory\" in\\nthe sense of practicing it in one line and having the improvement extend\\nequally to other lines. Committing poetry may have little or no effect\\nin strengthening the memory for historical or scientific data. In\\ngeneral, the memory must be trained in the specific lines in which it is\\nto excel. General training will not serve except as it may lead to\\nbetter modes of learning what is to be memorized.\\n\\n\\n6. WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD MEMORY\\n\\nLet us next inquire what are the qualities which enter into what we call\\na good memory. The merchant or politician will say, \"Ability to remember\\nwell people\\'s faces and names\"; the teacher of history, \"The ability to\\nrecall readily dates and events\"; the teacher of mathematics, \"The power\\nto recall mathematical formulæ\"; the hotel waiter, \"The ability to keep\\nin mind half-a-dozen orders at a time\"; the manager of a corporation,\\n\"The ability to recall all the necessary details connected with the\\nrunning of the concern.\" While these answers are very divergent, yet\\nthey may all be true for the particular person testifying; for out of\\nthem all there emerges this common truth, that _the best memory is the\\none which best serves its possessor_. That is, one\\'s memory not only\\nmust be ready and exact, but must produce the right kind of material; it\\nmust bring to us what we need in our thinking. A very easy corollary at\\nonce grows out of this fact; namely, that in order to have the memory\\nreturn to us the right kind of matter, we must store it with the right\\nkind of images and ideas, for the memory cannot give back to us anything\\nwhich we have not first given into its keeping.\\n\\nA GOOD MEMORY SELECTS ITS MATERIAL.--The best memory is not necessarily\\nthe one which impartially repeats the largest number of facts of past\\nexperience. Everyone has many experiences which he never needs to have\\nreproduced in memory; useful enough they may have been at the time, but\\nwholly useless and irrelevant later. They have served their purpose, and\\nshould henceforth slumber in oblivion. They would be but so much rubbish\\nand lumber if they could be recalled. Everyone has surely met that\\nparticular type of bore whose memory is so faithful to details that no\\nincident in the story he tells, no matter however trivial, is ever\\nomitted in the recounting. His associations work in such a tireless\\nround of minute succession, without ever being able to take a jump or a\\nshort cut, that he is powerless to separate the wheat from the chaff; so\\nhe dumps the whole indiscriminate mass into our long-suffering ears.\\n\\nDr. Carpenter tells of a member of Parliament who could repeat long\\nlegal documents and acts of Parliament after one reading. When he was\\ncongratulated on his remarkable gift, he replied that, instead of being\\nan advantage to him, it was often a source of great inconvenience,\\nbecause when he wished to recollect anything in a document he had read,\\nhe could do it only by repeating the whole from the beginning up to the\\npoint which he wished to recall. Maudsley says that the kind of memory\\nwhich enables a person \"to read a photographic copy of former\\nimpressions with his mind\\'s eye is not, indeed, commonly associated with\\nhigh intellectual power,\" and gives as a reason that such a mind is\\nhindered by the very wealth of material furnished by the memory from\\ndiscerning the relations between separate facts upon which judgment and\\nreasoning depend. It is likewise a common source of surprise among\\nteachers that many of the pupils who could outstrip their classmates in\\nlearning and memory do not turn out to be able men. But this, says\\nWhately, \"is as reasonable as to wonder that a cistern if filled should\\nnot be a perpetual fountain.\" It is possible for one to be so lost in a\\ntangle of trees that he cannot see the woods.\\n\\nA GOOD MEMORY REQUIRES GOOD THINKING.--It is not, then, mere\\nre-presentation of facts that constitutes a good memory. The pupil who\\ncan reproduce a history lesson by the page has not necessarily as good a\\nmemory as the one who remembers fewer facts, but sees the relations\\nbetween those remembered, and hence is _able to choose what he will\\nremember_. Memory must be _discriminative_. It must fasten on that which\\nis important and keep that for us. Therefore we can agree that \"_the art\\nof remembering is the art of thinking_.\" Discrimination must select the\\nimportant out of our mental stream, and these images must be associated\\nwith as many others as possible which are already well fixed in memory,\\nand hence are sure of recall when needed. In this way the old will\\nalways serve as a cue to call up the new.\\n\\nMEMORY MUST BE SPECIALIZED.--And not only must memory, if it is to be a\\ngood memory, omit the generally worthless, or trivial, or irrelevant,\\nand supply the generally useful, significant, and relevant, but it must\\nin some degree be a _specialized memory_. It must minister to the\\nparticular needs and requirements of its owner. Small consolation to you\\nif you are a Latin teacher, and are able to call up the binomial theorem\\nor the date of the fall of Constantinople when you are in dire need of a\\nconjugation or a declension which eludes you. It is much better for the\\nmerchant and politician to have a good memory for names and faces than\\nto be able to repeat the succession of English monarchs from Alfred the\\nGreat to Edward VII and not be able to tell John Smith from Tom Brown.\\nIt is much more desirable for the lawyer to be able to remember the\\nnecessary details of his case than to be able to recall all the various\\nathletic records of the year; and so on.\\n\\nIn order to be a good memory for _us_, our memory must be faithful in\\ndealing with the material which constitutes the needs of our vocations.\\nOur memory may, and should, bring to us many things outside of our\\nimmediate vocations, else our lives will be narrow; but its chief\\nconcern and most accurate work must be along the path of our everyday\\nrequirements at its hands. And this works out well in connection with\\nthe physiological laws which were stated a little while since, providing\\nthat our vocations are along the line of our interests. For the things\\nwith which we work daily, and in which we are interested, will be often\\nthought of together, and hence will become well associated. They will be\\nfrequently recalled, and hence more easily remembered; they will be\\nvividly experienced as the inevitable result of interest, and this goes\\nfar to insure recall.\\n\\n\\n7. MEMORY DEVICES\\n\\nMany devices have been invented for training or using the memory, and\\nnot a few worthless \"systems\" have been imposed by conscienceless fakers\\nupon uninformed people. All memorizing finally must go back to the\\nfundamental laws of brain activity and the rules growing out of these\\nlaws. There is no \"royal road\" to a good memory.\\n\\nTHE EFFECTS OF CRAMMING.--Not a few students depend on cramming for much\\nof their learning. If this method of study would yield as valuable\\npermanent results, it would be by far the most sensible and economical\\nmethod to use; for under the stress of necessity we often are able to\\naccomplish results much faster than when no pressure is resting upon us.\\nThe difficulty is, however, that the results are not permanent; the\\nfacts learned do not have time to seek out and link themselves to\\nwell-established associates; learned in an hour, their retention is as\\nephemeral as the application which gave them to us.\\n\\nFacts which are needed but temporarily and which cannot become a part of\\nour body of permanent knowledge may profitably be learned by cramming.\\nThe lawyer needs many details for the case he is trying, which not only\\nare valueless to him as soon as the case is decided, but would\\npositively be in his way. He may profitably cram such facts. But those\\nfacts which are to become a permanent part of his mental equipment, such\\nas the fundamental principles of law, he cannot cram. These he must have\\nin a logical chain which will not leave their recall dependent upon a\\nchance cue. Crammed facts may serve us during a recitation or an\\nexamination, but they never really become a part of us. Nothing can take\\nthe place of the logical placing of facts if they are to be remembered\\nwith facility, and be usable in thinking when recalled.\\n\\nREMEMBERING ISOLATED FACTS.--But after all this is taken into\\nconsideration there still remain a large number of facts which refuse to\\nfit into any connected or logical system. Or, if they do belong with\\nsome system, their connection is not very close, and we have more need\\nfor the few individual facts than for the system as a whole. Hence we\\nmust have some means of remembering such facts other than by connecting\\nthem with their logical associations. Such facts as may be typified by\\nthe multiplication table, certain dates, events, names, numbers,\\nerrands, and engagements of various kinds--all these need to be\\nremembered accurately and quickly when the occasion for them arises. We\\nmust be able to recall them with facility, so that the occasion will not\\nhave passed by before we can secure them and we have failed to do our\\npart because of the lapse.\\n\\nWith facts of this type the means of securing a good memory are the same\\nas in the case of logical memory, except that we must of necessity\\nforego the linking to naturally related associates. We can, however,\\ntake advantage of the three laws which have been given. If these methods\\nare used faithfully, then we have done what we can in the way of\\ninsuring the recall of facts of this type, unless we associate them with\\nsome artificial cue, such as tying a thread around our finger to\\nremember an errand, or learning the multiplication table by singing it.\\nWe are not to be too ready to excuse ourselves, however, if we have\\nforgotten to mail the letter or deliver the message; for our attention\\nmay have been very lax when we recorded the direction in the first\\nplace, and we may never have taken the trouble to think of the matter\\nbetween the time it was given into our keeping and the time we were to\\nperform the errand.\\n\\nMNEMONIC DEVICES.--Many ingenious devices have been invented to assist\\nthe memory. No doubt each one of you has some way of your own of\\nremembering certain things committed to you, or some much-needed fact\\nwhich has a tendency to elude you. You may not tie the traditional\\nstring around your finger or place your watch in the wrong pocket; but\\nif not, you have invented some method which suits your convenience\\nbetter. While many books have been written, and many lectures given\\nexploiting mnemonic systems, they are, however, all founded upon the\\nsame general principle: namely, that of _association of ideas_ in the\\nmind. They all make use of the same basis for memory that any of us use\\nevery time we remember anything, from the commonest event which occurred\\nlast hour to the most abstruse bit of philosophy which we may have in\\nour minds. They all tie the fact to be remembered to some other fact\\nwhich is sure of recall, and then trust the old fact to bring the new\\nalong with it when it again comes into the mind.\\n\\nArtificial devices may be permissible in remembering the class of facts\\nwhich have no logical associates in which we can relate them; but even\\nthen I cannot help feeling that if we should use the same care and\\ningenuity in carefully recording the seemingly unrelated facts that we\\ndo in working out the device and making the association in it, we should\\ndiscover hidden relations for most of the facts we wish to remember, and\\nwe should be able to insure their recall as certainly and in a better\\nway than through the device. Then, also, we should not be in danger of\\nhanding over to the device various facts for which we should discover\\nrelations, thus placing them in the logical body of our usable\\nknowledge where they belong.\\n\\n\\n8. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Carefully consider your own powers of memory and see whether you can\\ndecide which of the four types of brain you have. Apply similar tests to\\nyour classmates or a group of school children whom you have a chance to\\nobserve. Be sure to take into account the effects of past training or\\nhabits of memory.\\n\\n2. Watch in your own memorizing and also that of school children for\\nfailures in recall caused by lack of proper associations. Why is it\\nparticularly hard to commit what one does not understand?\\n\\n3. Observe a class in a recitation or an examination and seek to\\ndiscover whether any defects of memory revealed are to be explained by\\nlack of (1) repetition, (2) recency, (3) vividness in learning.\\n\\n4. Make a study of your own class and also of a group of children in\\nschool to discover their methods of memorizing. Have in mind the rules\\nfor memorizing given in section 5 of this chapter.\\n\\n5. Observe by introspection your method of recall of historical events\\nyou have studied, and note whether _images_ form an important part of\\nyour memory material; or does your recall consist chiefly of bare\\n_facts_? In how far does this depend on your method of _learning_ the\\nfacts in the first place?\\n\\n6. Carefully consider your experience from cramming your lessons. Does\\nthe material learned in this way stay with you? Do you _understand_ it\\nand find yourself able to _use_ it as well as stuff learned during a\\nlonger interval and with more time for associations to form?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nTHINKING\\n\\n\\nNo word is more constantly on our lips than the word _think_. A hundred\\ntimes a day we tell what we think about this thing or that. Any\\nexceptional power of thought classes us among the efficient of our\\ngeneration. It is in their ability to think that men stand preëminently\\nabove the animals.\\n\\n\\n1. DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINKING\\n\\nThe term _think_, or _thinking_, is employed in so many different senses\\nthat it will be well first of all to come to an understanding as to its\\nvarious uses. Four different types of thinking which we shall note\\nare:[5] (1) _chance_, or idle, thinking; (2) thinking in the form of\\n_uncritical belief_; (3) _assimilative_ thinking; and (4) _deliberative_\\nthinking.\\n\\nCHANCE OR IDLE THINKING.--Our thinking is of the chance or idle kind\\nwhen we think to no conscious end. No particular problem is up for\\nsolution, and the stream of thought drifts along in idleness. In such\\nthinking, immediate interest, some idle fancy, the impulse of the\\nmoment, or the suggestions from our environment determine the train of\\nassociations and give direction to our thought. In a sense, we surrender\\nour mental bark to the winds of circumstance to drive it whithersoever\\nthey will without let or hindrance from us. Since no results are sought\\nfrom our thinking, none are obtained. The best of us spend more time in\\nthese idle trains of thought than we would like to admit, while inferior\\nand untrained minds seldom rise above this barren thought level. Not\\ninfrequently even when we are studying a lesson which demands our best\\nthought power we find that an idle chain of associations has supplanted\\nthe more rigid type of thinking and appropriated the field.\\n\\nUNCRITICAL BELIEF.--We often say that we think a certain thing is true\\nor false when we have, as a matter of fact, done little or no thinking\\nabout it. We only _believe_, or uncritically accept, the common point of\\nview as to the truth or untruth of the matter concerned. The ancients\\nbelieved that the earth was flat, and the savages that eclipses were\\ncaused by animals eating up the moon. Not a few people today believe\\nthat potatoes and other vegetables should be planted at a certain phase\\nof the moon, that sickness is a visitation of Providence, and that\\nvarious \"charms\" are potent to bring good fortune or ward off disaster.\\nProbably not one in a thousand of those who accept such beliefs could\\ngive, or have ever tried to give, any rational reason for their point of\\nview.\\n\\nBut we must not be too harsh toward such crude illustrations of\\nuncritical thinking. It is entirely possible that not all of us who\\npride ourselves on our trained powers of thought could give good reasons\\ndiscovered by our own thinking why we think our political party, our\\nchurch, or our social organization is better than some other one. How\\nfew of us, after all, really _discover_ our creed, _join_ a church, or\\n_choose_ a political party! We adopt the points of view of our nation or\\nour group much as we adopt their customs and dress--not because we are\\nconvinced by thinking that they are best, but because they are less\\ntrouble.\\n\\nASSIMILATIVE THINKING.--It is this type of thinking that occupies us\\nwhen we seek to appropriate new facts or ideas and understand them; that\\nis, relate them to knowledge already on hand. We think after this\\nfashion in much of our study in schools and textbooks. The problem for\\nour thought is not so much one of invention or discovery as of grasp and\\nassimilation. Our thinking is to apprehend meanings and relations, and\\nso unify and give coherence to our knowledge.\\n\\nIn the absence of this type of thinking one may commit to memory many\\nfacts that he does not understand, gather much information that contains\\nlittle meaning to him, and even achieve very creditable scholastic\\ngrades that stand for a small amount of education or development. For\\nall information, to become vital and usable, must be thought into\\nrelation to our present active, functioning body of knowledge; therefore\\nassimilative thinking is fundamental to true mastery and learning.\\n\\nDELIBERATIVE THINKING.--Deliberative thinking constitutes the highest\\ntype of thought process. In order to do deliberative thinking there is\\nnecessary, first of all, what Dewey calls a \"split-road\" situation. A\\ntraveler going along a well-beaten highway, says Dr. Dewey, does not\\ndeliberate; he simply keeps on going. But let the highway split into two\\nroads at a fork, only one of which leads to the desired destination, and\\nnow a problem confronts him; he must take one road or the other, but\\n_which_? The intelligent traveler will at once go to _seeking for\\nevidence_ as to which road he should choose. He will balance this fact\\nagainst that fact, and this probability against that probability, in an\\neffort to arrive at a solution of his problem.\\n\\nBefore we can engage in deliberative thinking we must be confronted by\\nsome problem, some such \"_split-road_\" situation in our mental\\nstream--we must have something to think about. It is this fact that\\nmakes one writer say that the great purpose of one\\'s education is not to\\nsolve all his problems for him. It is rather to help him (1) to\\n_discover_ problems, or \"_split-road_\" situations, (2) to assist him in\\ngathering the facts necessary for their solution, and (3) to train him\\nin the weighing of his facts or evidence, that is, in deliberative\\nthinking. Only as we learn to recognize the true problems that confront\\nus in our own lives and in society about us can we become thinkers in\\nthe best sense. Our own plans and projects, the questions of right and\\nwrong that are constantly arising, the social, political and religious\\nproblems awaiting solution, all afford the opportunity and the necessity\\nfor deliberative thinking. And unhappy is the pupil whose school work\\ndoes not set the problems and employ the methods which will insure\\ntraining in this as well as in the assimilative type of thinking. Every\\nschool subject, besides supplying certain information to be \"learned,\"\\nshould present its problems requiring true deliberative thinking within\\nthe range of development and ability of the pupil, and no\\nsubject--literature, history, science, language--is without many such\\nproblems.\\n\\n\\n2. THE FUNCTION OF THINKING\\n\\nAll true thinking is for the purpose of discovering relations between\\nthe things we think about. Imagine a world in which nothing is related\\nto anything else; in which every object perceived, remembered, or\\nimagined, stands absolutely by itself, independent and self-sufficient!\\nWhat a chaos it would be! We might perceive, remember, and imagine all\\nthe various objects we please, but without the power to think them\\ntogether, they would all be totally unrelated, and hence have no\\nmeaning.\\n\\nMEANING DEPENDS ON RELATIONS.--To have a rational meaning for us, things\\nmust always be defined in terms of other things, or in terms of their\\nuses. _Fuel_ is that which feeds _fire_. _Food_ is what is eaten for\\n_nourishment_. A _locomotive_ is a machine for _drawing a train_.\\n_Books_ are to _read_, _pianos_ to _play_, _balls_ to _throw_, _schools_\\nto _instruct_, _friends_ to _enjoy_, and so on through the whole list of\\nobjects which we know or can define. Everything depends for its meaning\\non its relation to other things; and the more of these relations we can\\ndiscover, the more fully do we see the meaning. Thus balls may have\\nother uses than to throw, schools other functions than to instruct, and\\nfriends mean much more to us than mere enjoyment. And just in the degree\\nin which we have realized these different relations, have we defined the\\nobject, or, in other words, have we seen its meaning.\\n\\nTHE FUNCTION OF THINKING IS TO DISCOVER RELATIONS.--Now it is by\\n_thinking_ that these relations are discovered. This is the function of\\nthinking. Thinking takes the various separate items of our experience\\nand discovers to us the relations existing among them, and builds them\\ntogether into a unified, related, and usable body of knowledge,\\nthreading each little bit on the string of relationship which runs\\nthrough the whole. It was, no doubt, this thought which Tennyson had in\\nmind when he wrote:\\n\\n    Flower in the crannied wall,\\n    I pluck you out of the crannies,\\n    I hold you here, root and all, in my hand,\\n    Little flower--but if I could understand\\n    What you are, root and all, and all in all,\\n    I should know what God and man is.\\n\\nStarting in with even so simple a thing as a little flower, if he could\\ndiscover all the relations which every part bears to every other part\\nand to all other things besides, he would finally reach the meaning of\\nGod and man. For each separate thing, be it large or small, forms a link\\nin an unbroken chain of relationships which binds the universe into an\\nordered whole.\\n\\nNEAR AND REMOTE RELATIONS.--The relations discovered through our\\nthinking may be very close and simple ones, as when a child sees the\\nrelation between his bottle and his dinner; or they may be very remote\\nones, as when Newton saw the relation between the falling of an apple\\nand the motion of the planets in their orbits. But whether simple or\\nremote, the seeing of the relationships is in both cases alike thinking;\\nfor thinking is nothing, in its last analysis, but the discovering of\\nthe relationships which exist between the various objects in our mental\\nstream.\\n\\nThinking passes through all grades of complexity, from the first faint\\ndawnings in the mind of the babe when it sees the relation between the\\nmother and its feeding, on to the mighty grasp of the sage who is able\\nto \"think God\\'s thoughts after Him.\" But it all comes to the same end\\nfinally--the bringing to light of new meanings through the discovery of\\nnew relations. And whatever does this is thinking.\\n\\nCHILD AND ADULT THINKING.--What constitutes the difference in the\\nthinking of the child and that of the sage? Let us see whether we can\\ndiscover this difference. In the first place the relations seen by the\\nchild are _immediate_ relations: they exist between simple percepts or\\nimages; the remote and the general are beyond his reach. He has not had\\nsufficient experience to enable him to discover remote relations. He\\ncannot think things which are absent from him, or which he has never\\nknown. The child could by no possibility have seen in the falling apple\\nwhat Newton saw; for the child knew nothing of the planets in their\\norbits, and hence could not see relations in which these formed one of\\nthe terms. The sage, on the other hand, is not limited to his immediate\\npercepts or their images. He can see remote relations. He can go beyond\\nindividuals, and think in classes. The falling apple is not a mere\\nfalling apple to him, but one of a _class of falling bodies_. Besides a\\nrich experience full of valuable facts, the trained thinker has acquired\\nalso the habit of looking out for relations; he has learned that this is\\nthe method _par excellence_ of increasing his store of knowledge and of\\nrendering effective the knowledge he has. He has learned how to think.\\n\\nThe chief business of the child is the collection of the materials of\\nthought, seeing only the more necessary and obvious relations as he\\nproceeds; his chief business when older grown is to seek out the network\\nof relations which unites this mass of material, and through this\\nprocess to systematize and give new meanings to the whole.\\n\\n\\n3. THE MECHANISM OF THINKING\\n\\nIt is evident from the foregoing discussion that we may include under\\nthe term thinking all sorts of mental processes by which relations are\\napprehended between different objects of thought. Thus young children\\nthink as soon as they begin to understand something of the meaning of\\nthe objects of their environment. Even animals think by means of simple\\nand direct associations. Thinking may therefore go on in terms of the\\nsimplest and most immediate, or the most complex and distant\\nrelationships.\\n\\nSENSATIONS AND PERCEPTS AS ELEMENTS IN THINKING.--Relations seen between\\nsensations would mean something, but not much; relations seen between\\n_objects_ immediately present to the senses would mean much more; but\\nour thinking must go far beyond the present, and likewise far beyond\\nindividual objects. It must be able to annihilate both time and space,\\nand to deal with millions of individuals together in one group or class.\\nOnly in this way can our thinking go beyond that of the lower animals;\\nfor a wise rat, even, may come to see the relation between a trap and\\ndanger, or a horse the relation between pulling with his teeth at the\\npiece of string on the gate latch, and securing his liberty.\\n\\nBut it takes the farther-reaching mind of man to _invent_ the trap and\\nthe latch. Perception alone does not go far enough. It is limited to\\nimmediately present objects and their most obvious relations. The\\nperceptual image is likewise subject to similar limitations. While it\\nenables us to dispense with the immediate presence of the object, yet it\\ndeals with separate individuals; and the world is too full of individual\\nobjects for us to deal with them separately. It is in _conception_,\\n_judgment_, and _reasoning_ that true thinking takes place. Our next\\npurpose will therefore be to study these somewhat more closely, and see\\nhow they combine in our thinking.\\n\\n\\n4. THE CONCEPT\\n\\nFortunately for our thinking, the great external world, with its\\nmillions upon millions of individual objects, is so ordered that these\\nobjects can be grouped into comparatively few great classes; and for\\nmany purposes we can deal with the class as a whole instead of with the\\nseparate individuals of the class. Thus there are an infinite number of\\nindividual objects in the world which are composed of _matter_. Yet all\\nthese myriads of individuals may be classed under the two great heads of\\n_inanimate_ and _animate_. Taking one of these again: all animate forms\\nmay be classed as either _plants_ or _animals_. And these classes may\\nagain be subdivided indefinitely. Animals include mammals, birds,\\nreptiles, insects, mollusks, and many other classes besides, each class\\nof which may be still further separated into its _orders_, _families_,\\n_genera_, _species_, and _individuals_. This arrangement economizes our\\nthinking by allowing us to think in large terms.\\n\\nTHE CONCEPTS SERVE TO GROUP AND CLASSIFY.--But the somewhat complicated\\nform of classification just described did not come to man ready-made.\\nSomeone had to _see_ the relationship existing among the myriads of\\nanimals of a certain class, and group these together under the general\\nterm _mammals_. Likewise with birds, reptiles, insects, and all the\\nrest. In order to accomplish this, many individuals of each class had to\\nbe observed, the qualities common to all members of the class\\ndiscriminated from those not common, and the common qualities retained\\nas the measure by which to test the admission of other individuals into\\nthis class. The process of classification is made possible by what the\\npsychologist calls the _concept_. The concept enables us to think\\n_birds_ as well as bluebirds, robins, and wrens; it enables us to think\\n_men_ as well as Tom, Dick, and Harry. In other words, _the concept lies\\nat the bottom of all thinking which rises above the seeing of the\\nsimplest relations between immediately present objects_.\\n\\nGROWTH OF A CONCEPT.--We can perhaps best understand the nature of the\\nconcept if we watch its growth in the thinking of a child. Let us see\\nhow the child forms the concept _dog_, under which he is able finally to\\nclass the several hundred or the several thousand different dogs with\\nwhich his thinking requires him to deal. The child\\'s first acquaintance\\nwith a dog is, let us suppose, with a pet poodle, white in color, and\\nnamed _Gyp_. At this stage in the child\\'s experience, _dog_ and _Gyp_\\nare entirely synonymous, including Gyp\\'s color, size, and all other\\nqualities which the child has discovered. But now let him see another\\npet poodle which is like Gyp except that it is black in color. Here\\ncomes the first cleavage between _Gyp_ and _dog_ as synonyms: _dog_ no\\nlonger means white, but may mean _black_. Next let the child see a brown\\nspaniel. Not only will white and black now no longer answer to _dog_,\\nbut the roly-poly poodle form also has been lost; for the spaniel is\\nmore slender. Let the child go on from this until he has seen many\\ndifferent dogs of all varieties: poodles, bulldogs, setters, shepherds,\\ncockers, and a host of others. What has happened to his _dog_, which at\\nthe beginning meant the one particular little individual with which he\\nplayed?\\n\\n_Dog_ is no longer white or black or brown or gray: _color_ is not an\\nessential quality, so it has dropped out; _size_ is no longer essential\\nexcept within very broad limits; _shagginess_ or _smoothness_ of coat is\\na very inconstant quality, so this is dropped; _form_ varies so much\\nfrom the fat pug to the slender hound that it is discarded, except\\nwithin broad limits; _good nature_, _playfulness_, _friendliness_, and a\\ndozen other qualities are likewise found not to belong in common to\\n_all_ dogs, and so have had to go; and all that is left to his _dog_ is\\n_four-footedness_, and a certain general _form_, and a few other dog\\nqualities of habit of life and disposition. As the term _dog_ has been\\ngaining in _extent_, that is, as more individuals have been observed and\\nclassed under it, it has correspondingly been losing in _content_, or it\\nhas been losing in the specific qualities which belong to it. Yet it\\nmust not be thought that the process is altogether one of elimination;\\nfor new qualities which are present in all the individuals of a class,\\nbut at first overlooked, are continually being discovered as experience\\ngrows, and built into the developing concept.\\n\\nDEFINITION OF CONCEPT.--A concept, then, is _our general idea or notion\\nof a class of individual objects_. Its function is to enable us to\\nclassify our knowledge, and thus deal with classes or universals in our\\nthinking. Often the basis of a concept consists of an _image_, as when\\nyou get a hazy visual image of a mass of people when I suggest _mankind_\\nto you. Yet the core, or the vital, functioning part of a concept is its\\n_meaning_. Whether this meaning attaches to an image or a word or stands\\nrelatively or completely independent of either, does not so much matter;\\nbut our meanings must be right, else all our thinking is wrong.\\n\\nLANGUAGE AND THE CONCEPT.--We think in words. None has failed to watch\\nthe flow of his thought as it is carried along by words like so many\\nlittle boats moving along the mental stream, each with its freight of\\nmeaning. And no one has escaped the temporary balking of his thought by\\nfailure to find a suitable word to convey the intended meaning. What\\nthe grammarian calls the _common nouns_ of our language are the words by\\nwhich we name our concepts and are able to speak of them to others. We\\ndefine a common noun as \"the name of a class,\" and we define a concept\\nas the meaning or idea we have of a class. It is easy to see that when\\nwe have named these class _ideas_ we have our list of common nouns. The\\nstudy of the language of a people may therefore reveal much of their\\ntype of thought.\\n\\nTHE NECESSITY FOR GROWING CONCEPTS.--The development of our concepts\\nconstitutes a large part of our education. For it is evident that, since\\nthinking rests so fundamentally on concepts, progress in our mental life\\nmust depend on a constant growth in the number and character of our\\nconcepts. Not only must we keep on adding new concepts, but the old must\\nnot remain static. When our concepts stop growing, our minds have ceased\\nto grow--we no longer learn. This arrest of development is often seen in\\npersons who have settled into a life of narrow routine, where the\\ndemands are few and of a simple nature. Unless they rise above their\\nroutine, they early become \"old fogies.\" Their concepts petrify from\\nlack of use and the constant reconstruction which growth necessitates.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the person who has upon him the constant demand to\\nmeet new situations or do better in old ones will keep on enriching his\\nold concepts and forming new ones, or else, unable to do this, he will\\nfail in his position. And the person who keeps on steadily enriching his\\nconcepts has discovered the secret of perpetual youth so far as his\\nmental life is concerned. For him there is no old age; his thought will\\nbe always fresh, his experience always accumulating, and his knowledge\\ngrowing more valuable and usable.\\n\\n\\n5. JUDGMENT\\n\\nBut in the building up of percepts and concepts, as well as in making\\nuse of them after they are formed, another process of thinking enters;\\nnamely, the process of _judging_.\\n\\nNATURE OF JUDGMENT.--Judging enters more or less into all our thinking,\\nfrom the simplest to the most complex. The babe lies staring at his\\nbottle, and finally it dawns on his sluggish mind that this is the\\nobject from which he gets his dinner. He has performed a judgment. That\\nis, he has alternately directed his attention to the object before him\\nand to his image of former nursing, discovered the relation existing\\nbetween the two, and affirmed to himself, \"This is what gives me my\\ndinner.\" \"Bottle\" and \"what-gives-me-my-dinner\" are essentially\\nidentical to the child. _Judgment is, then, the affirmation of the\\nessential identity of meaning of two objects of thought._ Even if the\\nproposition in which we state our judgment has in it a negative, the\\ndefinition will still hold, for the mental process is the same in either\\ncase. It is as much a judgment if we say, \"The day is not-cold,\" as if\\nwe say, \"The day is cold.\"\\n\\nJUDGMENT USED IN PERCEPTS AND CONCEPTS.--How judgment enters into the\\nforming of our percepts may be seen from the illustration just given.\\nThe act by which the child perceived his bottle had in it a large\\nelement of judging. He had to compare two objects of thought--the one\\nfrom past experience in the form of images, and the other from the\\npresent object, in the form of sensations from the bottle--and then\\naffirm their essential identity. Of course it is not meant that what I\\nhave described _consciously_ takes place in the mind of the child; but\\nsome such process lies at the bottom of every perception, whether of\\nthe child or anyone else.\\n\\nLikewise it may be seen that the forming of concepts depends on\\njudgment. Every time that we meet a new object which has to be assigned\\nits place in our classification, judgment is required. Suppose the\\nchild, with his immature concept _dog_, sees for the first time a\\ngreyhound. He must compare this new specimen with his concept _dog_, and\\ndecide that this is or is not a dog. If he discovers the identity of\\nmeaning in the essentials of the two objects of thought, his judgment\\nwill be affirmative, and his concept will be modified in whatever extent\\n_greyhound_ will affect it.\\n\\nJUDGMENT LEADS TO GENERAL TRUTHS.--But judgment goes much farther than\\nto assist in building percepts and concepts. It takes our concepts after\\nthey are formed and discovers and affirms relations between them, thus\\nenabling us finally to relate classes as well as individuals. It carries\\nour thinking over into the realm of the universal, where we are not\\nhampered by particulars. Let us see how this is done. Suppose we have\\nthe concept _man_ and the concept _animal_, and that we think of these\\ntwo concepts in their relation to each other. The mind analyzes each\\ninto its elements, compares them, and finds the essential identity of\\nmeaning in a sufficient number to warrant the judgment, _man is an\\nanimal_. This judgment has given a new bit of knowledge, in that it has\\ndiscovered to us a new relation between two great classes, and hence\\ngiven both, in so far, a new meaning and a wider definition. And as this\\nnew relation does not pertain to any particular man or any particular\\nanimal, but includes all individuals in each class, it has carried us\\nover into universals, so that we have a _general_ truth and will not\\nhave to test each individual man henceforth to see whether he fits into\\nthis relation.\\n\\nJudgments also, as we will see later, constitute the material for our\\nreasoning. Hence upon their validity will depend the validity of our\\nreasoning.\\n\\nTHE VALIDITY OF JUDGMENTS.--Now, since every judgment is made up of an\\naffirmation of relation existing between two terms, it is evident that\\nthe validity of the judgment will depend on the thoroughness of our\\nknowledge of the terms compared. If we know but few of the attributes of\\neither term of the judgment, the judgment is clearly unsafe. Imperfect\\nconcepts lie at the basis of many of our wrong judgments. A young man\\ncomplained because his friend had been expelled from college for alleged\\nmisbehavior. He said, \"Mr. A---- was the best boy in the institution.\"\\nIt is very evident that someone had made a mistake in judgment. Surely\\nno college would want to expel the best boy in the institution. Either\\nmy complainant or the authorities of the college had failed to\\nunderstand one of the terms in the judgment. Either \"Mr. A----\" or \"the\\nbest boy in the institution\" had been wrongly interpreted by someone.\\nLikewise, one person will say, \"Jones is a good man,\" while another will\\nsay, \"Jones is a rascal.\" Such a discrepancy in judgment must come from\\na lack of acquaintance with Jones or a lack of knowledge of what\\nconstitutes a good man or a rascal.\\n\\nNo doubt most of us are prone to make judgments with too little\\nknowledge of the terms we are comparing, and it is usually those who\\nhave the least reason for confidence in their judgments who are the most\\ncertain that they cannot be mistaken. The remedy for faulty judgments\\nis, of course, in making ourselves more certain of the terms involved,\\nand this in turn sends us back for a review of our concepts or the\\nexperience upon which the terms depend. It is evident that no two\\npersons can have just the same concepts, for all have not had the same\\nexperience out of which their concepts came. The concepts may be named\\nthe same, and may be nearly enough alike so that we can usually\\nunderstand each other; but, after all, I have mine and you have yours,\\nand if we could each see the other\\'s in their true light, no doubt we\\nshould save many misunderstandings and quarrels.\\n\\n\\n6. REASONING\\n\\nAll the mental processes which we have so far described find their\\nculmination and highest utility in _reasoning_. Not that reasoning comes\\nlast in the list of mental activities, and cannot take place until all\\nthe others have been completed, for reasoning is in some degree present\\nalmost from the dawn of consciousness. The difference between the\\nreasoning of the child and that of the adult is largely one of\\ndegree--of reach. Reasoning goes farther than any of the other processes\\nof cognition, for it takes the relations expressed in judgments and out\\nof these relations evolves still other and more ultimate relations.\\n\\nNATURE OF REASONING.--It is hard to define reasoning so as to describe\\nthe precise process which occurs; for it is so intermingled with\\nperception, conception, and judgment, that one can hardly separate them\\neven for purposes of analysis, much less to separate them functionally.\\nWe may, however, define reasoning provisionally as _thinking by means of\\na series of judgments with the purpose of arriving at some definite end\\nor conclusion_. What does this mean? Professor Angell has stated the\\nmatter so clearly that I will quote his illustration of the case:\\n\\n\"Suppose that we are about to make a long journey which necessitates\\nthe choice from among a number of possible routes. This is a case of the\\ngenuinely problematic kind. It requires reflection, a weighing of the\\n_pros_ and _cons_, and giving of the final decision in favor of one or\\nother of several alternatives. In such a case the procedure of most of\\nus is after this order. We think of one route as being picturesque and\\nwholly novel, but also as being expensive. We think of another as less\\ninteresting, but also as less expensive. A third is, we discover, the\\nmost expedient, but also the most costly of the three. We find ourselves\\nconfronted, then, with the necessity of choosing with regard to the\\nrelative merits of cheapness, beauty, and speed. We proceed to consider\\nthese points in the light of all our interests, and the decision more or\\nless makes itself. We find, for instance, that we must, under the\\ncircumstances, select the cheapest route.\"\\n\\nHOW JUDGMENTS FUNCTION IN REASONING.--Such a line of thinking is very\\ncommon to everyone, and one that we carry out in one form or another a\\nthousand times every day we live. When we come to look closely at the\\nsteps involved in arriving at a conclusion, we detect a series of\\njudgments--often not very logically arranged, to be sure, but yet so\\nrelated that the result is safely reached in the end. We compare our\\nconcept of, say, the first route and our concept of picturesqueness,\\ndecide they agree, and affirm the judgment, \"This route is picturesque.\"\\nLikewise we arrive at the judgment, \"This route is also expensive, it is\\ninteresting, etc.\" Then we take the other routes and form our judgments\\nconcerning them. These judgments are all related to each other in some\\nway, some of them being more intimately related than others. Which\\njudgments remain as the significant ones, the ones which are used to\\nsolve the problem finally, depends on which concepts are the most vital\\nfor us with reference to the ultimate end in view. If time is the chief\\nelement, then the form of our reasoning would be something like this:\\n\"Two of the routes require more than three days: hence I must take the\\nthird route.\" If economy is the important end, the solution would be as\\nfollows: \"Two routes cost more than $1,000; I cannot afford to pay more\\nthan $800; I therefore must patronize the third route.\"\\n\\nIn both cases it is evident that the conclusion is reached through a\\ncomparison of two or more judgments. This is the essential difference\\nbetween judgment and reasoning. Whereas judgment discovers relations\\nbetween concepts, _reasoning discovers relations between judgments, and\\nfrom this evolves a new judgment which is the conclusion sought_. The\\nexample given well illustrates the ordinary method by which we reason to\\nconclusions.\\n\\nDEDUCTION AND THE SYLLOGISM.--Logic may take the conclusion, with the\\ntwo judgments on which it is based, and form the three into what is\\ncalled a _syllogism_, of which the following is a classical type:\\n\\n    All men are mortal;\\n    Socrates is a man,\\n    Therefore\\n    Socrates is mortal.\\n\\nThe first judgment is in the form of a proposition which is called the\\n_major premise_, because it is general in its nature, including all men.\\nThe second is the _minor premise_, since it deals with a particular man.\\nThe third is the _conclusion_, in which a new relation is discovered\\nbetween Socrates and mortality.\\n\\nThis form of reasoning is _deductive_, that is, it proceeds from the\\ngeneral to the particular. Much of our reasoning is an abbreviated form\\nof the syllogism, and will readily expand into it. For instance, we say,\\n\"It will rain tonight, for there is lightning in the west.\" Expanded\\ninto the syllogism form it would be, \"Lightning in the west is a sure\\nsign of rain; there is lightning in the west this evening; therefore, it\\nwill rain tonight.\" While we do not commonly think in complete\\nsyllogisms, it is often convenient to cast our reasoning in this form to\\ntest its validity. For example, a fallacy lurks in the generalization,\\n\"Lightning in the west is a sure sign of rain.\" Hence the conclusion is\\nof doubtful validity.\\n\\nINDUCTION.--Deduction is a valuable form of reasoning, but a moment\\'s\\nreflection will show that something must precede the syllogism in our\\nreasoning. The _major premise must be accounted for_. How are we able to\\nsay that all men are mortal, and that lightning in the west is a sure\\nsign of rain? How was this general truth arrived at? There is only one\\nway, namely, through the observation of a large number of particular\\ninstances, or through _induction_.\\n\\nInduction is the method of proceeding from the particular to the\\ngeneral. Many men are observed, and it is found that all who have been\\nobserved have died under a certain age. It is true that not all men have\\nbeen observed to die, since many are now living, and many more will no\\ndoubt come and live in the world whom _we_ cannot observe, since\\nmortality will have overtaken us before their advent. To this it may be\\nanswered that the men now living have not yet lived up to the limit of\\ntheir time, and, besides, they have within them the causes working whose\\ninevitable effect has always been and always will be death; likewise\\nwith the men yet unborn, they will possess the same organism as we,\\nwhose very nature necessitates mortality. In the case of the\\npremonitions of rain, the generalization is not so safe, for there have\\nbeen exceptions. Lightning in the west at night is not always followed\\nby rain, nor can we find inherent causes as in the other case which\\nnecessitates rain as an effect.\\n\\nTHE NECESSITY FOR BROAD INDUCTION.--Thus it is seen that our\\ngeneralizations, or major premises, are of all degrees of validity. In\\nthe case of some, as the mortality of man, millions of cases have been\\nobserved and no exceptions found, but on the contrary, causes discovered\\nwhose operation renders the result inevitable. In others, as, for\\ninstance, in the generalization once made, \"All cloven-footed animals\\nchew their cud,\" not only had the examination of individual cases not\\nbeen carried so far as in the former case when the generalization was\\nmade, but there were found no inherent causes residing in cloven-footed\\nanimals which make it necessary for them to chew their cud. That is,\\ncloven feet and cud-chewing do not of necessity go together, and the\\ncase of the pig disproves the generalization.\\n\\nIn practically no instance, however, is it possible for us to examine\\nevery case upon which a generalization is based; after examining a\\nsufficient number of cases, and particularly if there are supporting\\ncauses, we are warranted in making the \"inductive leap,\" or in\\nproceeding at once to state our generalization as a working hypothesis.\\nOf course it is easy to see that if we have a wrong generalization, if\\nour major premise is invalid, all that follows in our chain of reasoning\\nwill be worthless. This fact should render us careful in making\\ngeneralizations on too narrow a basis of induction. We may have observed\\nthat certain red-haired people of our acquaintance are quick-tempered,\\nbut we are not justified from this in making the general statement that\\nall red-haired people are quick-tempered. Not only have we not examined\\na sufficient number of cases to warrant such a conclusion, but we have\\nfound in the red hair not even a cause of quick temper, but only an\\noccasional concomitant.\\n\\nTHE INTERRELATION OF INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION.--Induction and deduction\\nmust go hand in hand in building up our world of knowledge. Induction\\ngives us the particular facts out of which our system of knowledge is\\nbuilt, furnishes us with the data out of which general truths are\\nformed; deduction allows us to start with the generalization furnished\\nus by induction, and from this vantage ground to organize and\\nsystematize our knowledge and, through the discovery of its relations,\\nto unify it and make it usable. Deduction starts with a general truth\\nand asks the question, \"What new relations are made necessary among\\nparticular facts by this truth?\" Induction starts with particulars, and\\nasks the question, \"To what general truth do these separate facts lead?\"\\nEach method of reasoning needs the other. Deduction must have induction\\nto furnish the facts for its premises; induction must have deduction to\\norganize these separate facts into a unified body of knowledge. \"He only\\nsees well who sees the whole in the parts, and the parts in the whole.\"\\n\\n\\n7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Watch your own thinking for examples of each of the four types\\ndescribed. Observe a class of children in a recitation or at study and\\ntry to decide which type is being employed by each child. What\\nproportion of the time supposedly given to study is given over to\\n_chance_ or idle thinking? To _assimilative_ thinking? To _deliberative_\\nthinking?\\n\\n2. Observe children at work in school with the purpose of determining\\nwhether they are being taught to _think_, or only to memorize certain\\nfacts. Do you find that definitions whose meaning is not clear are often\\nrequired of children? Which should come first, the definition or the\\nmeaning and application of it?\\n\\n3. It is of course evident from the relation of induction and deduction\\nthat the child\\'s natural mode of learning a subject is by induction.\\nObserve the teaching of children to determine whether inductive methods\\nare commonly used. Outline an inductive lesson in arithmetic,\\nphysiology, geography, civics, etc.\\n\\n4. What concepts have you now which you are aware are very meager? What\\nis your concept of _mountain?_ How many have you seen? Have you any\\nconcepts which you are working very hard to enrich?\\n\\n5. Recall some judgment which you have made and which proved to be\\nfalse, and see whether you can now discover what was wrong with it. Do\\nyou find the trouble to be an inadequate concept? What constitutes \"good\\njudgment\"? \"poor judgment\"? Did you ever make a mistake in an example\\nin, say, percentage, by saying \"This is the base,\" when it proved not to\\nbe? What was the cause of the error?\\n\\n6. Can you recall any instance in which you made too hasty a\\ngeneralization when you had observed but few cases upon which to base\\nyour premise? What of your reasoning which followed?\\n\\n7. See whether you can show that validity of reasoning rests ultimately\\non correct perceptions. What are you doing at present to increase your\\npower of thinking?\\n\\n8. How ought this chapter to help one in making a better teacher? A\\nbetter student?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nINSTINCT\\n\\n\\nNothing is more wonderful than nature\\'s method of endowing each\\nindividual at the beginning with all the impulses, tendencies and\\ncapacities that are to control and determine the outcome of the life.\\nThe acorn has the perfect oak tree in its heart; the complete butterfly\\nexists in the grub; and man at his highest powers is present in the babe\\nat birth. Education _adds_ nothing to what heredity supplies, but only\\ndevelops what is present from the first.\\n\\nWe are a part of a great unbroken procession of life, which began at the\\nbeginning and will go on till the end. Each generation receives, through\\nheredity, the products of the long experience through which the race has\\npassed. The generation receiving the gift today lives its own brief\\nlife, makes its own little contribution to the sum total and then passes\\non as millions have done before. Through heredity, the achievements, the\\npassions, the fears, and the tragedies of generations long since\\nmoldered to dust stir our blood and tone our nerves for the conflict of\\ntoday.\\n\\n\\n1. THE NATURE OF INSTINCT\\n\\nEvery child born into the world has resting upon him an unseen hand\\nreaching out from the past, pushing him out to meet his environment, and\\nguiding him in the start upon his journey. This impelling and guiding\\npower from the past we call _instinct_. In the words of Mosso: \"Instinct\\nis the voice of past generations reverberating like a distant echo in\\nthe cells of the nervous system. We feel the breath, the advice, the\\nexperience of all men, from those who lived on acorns and struggled like\\nwild beasts, dying naked in the forests, down to the virtue and toil of\\nour father, the fear and love of our mother.\"\\n\\nTHE BABE\\'S DEPENDENCE ON INSTINCT.--The child is born ignorant and\\nhelpless. It has no memory, no reason, no imagination. It has never\\nperformed a conscious act, and does not know how to begin. It must get\\nstarted, but how? It has no experience to direct it, and is unable to\\nunderstand or imitate others of its kind. It is at this point that\\ninstinct comes to the rescue. The race has not given the child a mind\\nready made--that must develop; but it has given him a ready-made nervous\\nsystem, ready to respond with the proper movements when it receives the\\ntouch of its environment through the senses.\\n\\nAnd this nervous system has been so trained during a limitless past that\\nits responses are the ones which are necessary for the welfare of its\\nowner. It can do a hundred things without having to wait to learn them.\\nBurdette says of the new-born child, \"Nobody told him what to do. Nobody\\ntaught him. He knew. Placed suddenly on the guest list of this old\\ncaravansary, he knew his way at once to two places in it--his bedroom\\nand the dining-room.\" A thousand generations of babies had done the same\\nthing in the same way, and each had made it a little easier for this\\nparticular baby to do his part without learning how.\\n\\nDEFINITION OF INSTINCT.--_Instincts are the tendency to act in certain\\ndefinite ways, without previous education and without a conscious end in\\nview._ They are a tendency to _act_; for some movement, or motor\\nadjustment, is the response to an instinct. They do not require previous\\n_education_, for none is possible with many instinctive acts: the duck\\ndoes not have to be taught to swim or the baby to suck. They have no\\nconscious _end_ in view, though the result may be highly desirable.\\n\\nSays James: \"The cat runs after the mouse, runs or shows fight before\\nthe dog, avoids falling from walls and trees, shuns fire and water,\\netc., not because he has any notion either of life or death, or of self,\\nor of preservation. He has probably attained to no one of these\\nconceptions in such a way as to react definitely upon it. He acts in\\neach case separately, and simply because he cannot help it; being so\\nframed that when that particular running thing called a mouse appears in\\nhis field of vision he _must_ pursue; that when that particular barking\\nand obstreperous thing called a dog appears he _must_ retire, if at a\\ndistance, and scratch if close by; that he _must_ withdraw his feet from\\nwater and his face from flame, etc. His nervous system is to a great\\nextent a pre-organized bundle of such reactions. They are as fatal as\\nsneezing, and exactly correlated to their special excitants as it to its\\nown.\"[6]\\n\\nYou ask, Why does the lark rise on the flash of a sunbeam from his\\nmeadow to the morning sky, leaving a trail of melody to mark his flight?\\nWhy does the beaver build his dam, and the oriole hang her nest? Why are\\nmyriads of animal forms on the earth today doing what they were\\ncountless generations ago? Why does the lover seek the maid, and the\\nmother cherish her young? _Because the voice of the past speaks to the\\npresent, and the present has no choice but to obey._\\n\\nINSTINCTS ARE RACIAL HABITS.--Instincts are the habits of the race which\\nit bequeaths to the individual; the individual takes these for his\\nstart, and then modifies them through education, and thus adapts himself\\nto his environment. Through his instincts, the individual is enabled to\\nshort-cut racial experience, and begin at once on life activities which\\nthe race has been ages in acquiring. Instinct preserves to us what the\\nrace has achieved in experience, and so starts us out where the race\\nleft off.\\n\\nUNMODIFIED INSTINCT IS BLIND.--Many of the lower animal forms act on\\ninstinct blindly, unable to use past experience to guide their acts,\\nincapable of education. Some of them carry out seemingly marvelous\\nactivities, yet their acts are as automatic as those of a machine and as\\ndevoid of foresight. A species of mud wasp carefully selects clay of\\njust the right consistency, finds a somewhat sheltered nook under the\\neaves, and builds its nest, leaving one open door. Then it seeks a\\ncertain kind of spider, and having stung it so as to benumb without\\nkilling, carries it into the new-made nest, lays its eggs on the body of\\nthe spider so that the young wasps may have food immediately upon\\nhatching out, then goes out and plasters the door over carefully to\\nexclude all intruders. Wonderful intelligence? Not intelligence at all.\\nIts acts were dictated not by plans for the future, but by pressure from\\nthe past. Let the supply of clay fail, or the race of spiders become\\nextinct, and the wasp is helpless and its species will perish. Likewise\\nthe _race_ of bees and ants have done wonderful things, but _individual_\\nbees and ants are very stupid and helpless when confronted by any novel\\nconditions to which their race has not been accustomed.\\n\\nMan starts in as blindly as the lower animals; but, thanks to his higher\\nmental powers, this blindness soon gives way to foresight, and he is\\nable to formulate purposeful ends and adapt his activities to their\\naccomplishment. Possessing a larger number of instincts than the lower\\nanimals have, man finds possible a greater number of responses to a more\\ncomplex environment than do they. This advantage, coupled with his\\nability to reconstruct his experience in such a way that he secures\\nconstantly increasing control over his environment, easily makes man the\\nsuperior of all the animals, and enables him to exploit them for his own\\nfurther advancement.\\n\\n\\n2. LAW OF THE APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF INSTINCTS\\n\\nNo child is born with all its instincts ripe and ready for action. Yet\\neach individual contains within his own inner nature the law which\\ndetermines the order and time of their development.\\n\\nINSTINCTS APPEAR IN SUCCESSION AS REQUIRED.--It is not well that we\\nshould be started on too many different lines of activity at once, hence\\nour instincts do not all appear at the same time. Only as fast as we\\nneed additional activities do they ripen. Our very earliest activities\\nare concerned chiefly with feeding, hence we first have the instincts\\nwhich prompt us to take our food and to cry for it when we are hungry.\\nAlso we find useful such abbreviated instincts, called _reflexes_, as\\nsneezing, snuffling, gagging, vomiting, starting, etc.; hence we have\\nthe instincts enabling us to do these things. Soon comes the time for\\nteething, and, to help the matter along, the instinct of biting enters,\\nand the rubber ring is in demand. The time approaches when we are to\\nfeed ourselves, so the instinct arises to carry everything to the mouth.\\nNow we have grown strong and must assume an erect attitude, hence the\\ninstinct to sit up and then to stand. Locomotion comes next, and with it\\nthe instinct to creep and walk. Also a language must be learned, and we\\nmust take part in the busy life about us and do as other people do; so\\nthe instinct to imitate arises that we may learn things quickly and\\neasily.\\n\\nWe need a spur to keep us up to our best effort, so the instinct of\\nemulation emerges. We must defend ourselves, so the instinct of\\npugnacity is born. We need to be cautious, hence the instinct of fear.\\nWe need to be investigative, hence the instinct of curiosity. Much\\nself-directed activity is necessary for our development, hence the play\\ninstinct. It is best that we should come to know and serve others, so\\nthe instincts of sociability and sympathy arise. We need to select a\\nmate and care for offspring, hence the instinct of love for the other\\nsex, and the parental instinct. This is far from a complete list of our\\ninstincts, and I have not tried to follow the order of their\\ndevelopment, but I have given enough to show the origin of many of our\\nlife\\'s most important activities.\\n\\nMANY INSTINCTS ARE TRANSITORY.--Not only do instincts ripen by degrees,\\nentering our experience one by one as they are needed, but they drop out\\nwhen their work is done. Some, like the instinct of self-preservation,\\nare needed our lifetime through, hence they remain to the end. Others,\\nlike the play instinct, serve their purpose and disappear or are\\nmodified into new forms in a few years, or a few months. The life of the\\ninstinct is always as transitory as is the necessity for the activity\\nto which it gives rise. No instinct remains wholly unaltered in man, for\\nit is constantly being made over in the light of each new experience.\\nThe instinct of self-preservation is modified by knowledge and\\nexperience, so that the defense of the man against threatened danger\\nwould be very different from that of the child; yet the instinct to\\nprotect oneself in _some_ way remains. On the other hand, the instinct\\nto romp and play is less permanent. It may last into adult life, but few\\nmiddle-aged or old people care to race about as do children. Their\\nactivities are occupied in other lines, and they require less physical\\nexertion.\\n\\nContrast with these two examples such instincts as sucking, creeping,\\nand crying, which are much more fleeting than the play instinct, even.\\nWith dentition comes another mode of eating, and sucking is no more\\nserviceable. Walking is a better mode of locomotion than creeping, so\\nthe instinct to creep soon dies. Speech is found a better way than\\ncrying to attract attention to distress, so this instinct drops out.\\nMany of our instincts not only would fail to be serviceable in our later\\nlives, but would be positively in the way. Each serves its day, and then\\npasses over into so modified a form as not to be recognized, or else\\ndrops out of sight altogether.\\n\\nSEEMINGLY USELESS INSTINCTS.--Indeed it is difficult to see that some\\ninstincts serve a useful purpose at any time. The pugnacity and\\ngreediness of childhood, its foolish fears, the bashfulness of\\nyouth--these seem to be either useless or detrimental to development.\\nIn order to understand the workings of instinct, however, we must\\nremember that it looks in two directions; into the future for its\\napplication, and into the past for its explanation. We should not be\\nsurprised if the experiences of a long past have left behind some\\ntendencies which are not very useful under the vastly different\\nconditions of today.\\n\\nNor should we be too sure that an activity whose precise function in\\nrelation to development we cannot discover has no use at all. Each\\ninstinct must be considered not alone in the light of what it means to\\nits possessor today, but of what it means to all his future development.\\nThe tail of a polliwog seems a very useless appendage so far as the\\nadult frog is concerned, yet if the polliwog\\'s tail is cut off a perfect\\nfrog never develops.\\n\\nINSTINCTS TO BE UTILIZED WHEN THEY APPEAR.--A man may set the stream to\\nturning his mill wheels today or wait for twenty years--the power is\\nthere ready for him when he wants it. Instincts must be utilized when\\nthey present themselves, else they disappear--never, in most cases, to\\nreturn. Birds kept caged past the flying time never learn to fly well.\\nThe hunter must train his setter when the time is ripe, or the dog can\\nnever be depended upon. Ducks kept away from the water until full grown\\nhave almost as little inclination for it as chickens.\\n\\nThe child whom the pressure of circumstances or unwise authority of\\nparents keeps from mingling with playmates and participating in their\\nplays and games when the social instinct is strong upon him, will in\\nlater life find himself a hopeless recluse to whom social duties are a\\nbore. The boy who does not hunt and fish and race and climb at the\\nproper time for these things, will find his taste for them fade away,\\nand he will become wedded to a sedentary life. The youth and maiden must\\nbe permitted to \"dress up\" when the impulse comes to them, or they are\\nlikely ever after to be careless in their attire.\\n\\nINSTINCTS AS STARTING POINTS.--Most of our habits have their rise in\\ninstincts, and all desirable instincts should be seized upon and\\ntransformed into habits before they fade away. Says James in his\\nremarkable chapter on Instinct: \"In all pedagogy the great thing is to\\nstrike while the iron is hot, and to seize the wave of the pupils\\'\\ninterest in each successive subject before its ebb has come, so that\\nknowledge may be got and a habit of skill acquired--a headway of\\ninterest, in short, secured, on which afterwards the individual may\\nfloat. There is a happy moment for fixing skill in drawing, for making\\nboys collectors in natural history, and presently dissectors and\\nbotanists; then for initiating them into the harmonies of mechanics and\\nthe wonders of physical and chemical law. Later, introspective\\npsychology and the metaphysical and religious mysteries take their turn;\\nand, last of all, the drama of human affairs and worldly wisdom in the\\nwidest sense of the term. In each of us a saturation point is soon\\nreached in all these things; the impetus of our purely intellectual zeal\\nexpires, and unless the topic is associated with some urgent personal\\nneed that keeps our wits constantly whetted about it, we settle into an\\nequilibrium, and live on what we learned when our interest was fresh and\\ninstinctive, without adding to the store.\"\\n\\n    There is a tide in the affairs of men\\n    Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\\n    Omitted, all the voyage of their life\\n    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.\\n\\nTHE MORE IMPORTANT HUMAN INSTINCTS.--It will be impossible in this brief\\nstatement to give a complete catalogue of the human instincts, much\\nless to discuss each in detail. We must content ourselves therefore with\\nnaming the more important instincts, and finally discussing a few of\\nthem: _Sucking_, _biting_, _chewing_, _clasping objects with the\\nfingers_, _carrying to the mouth_, _crying_, _smiling_, _sitting up_,\\n_standing_, _locomotion_, _vocalization_, _imitation_, _emulation_,\\n_pugnacity_, _resentment_, _anger_, _sympathy_, _hunting and fighting_,\\n_fear_, _acquisitiveness_, _play_, _curiosity_, _sociability_,\\n_modesty_, _secretiveness_, _shame_, _love_, _and jealousy_ may be said\\nto head the list of our instincts. It will be impossible in our brief\\nspace to discuss all of this list. Only a few of the more important will\\nbe noticed.\\n\\n\\n3. THE INSTINCT OF IMITATION\\n\\nNo individual enters the world with a large enough stock of instincts to\\nstart him doing all the things necessary for his welfare. Instinct\\nprompts him to eat when he is hungry, but does not tell him to use a\\nknife and fork and spoon; it prompts him to use vocal speech, but does\\nnot say whether he shall use English, French, or German; it prompts him\\nto be social in his nature, but does not specify that he shall say\\nplease and thank you, and take off his hat to ladies. The race did not\\nfind the specific _modes_ in which these and many other things are to be\\ndone of sufficient importance to crystallize them in instincts, hence\\nthe individual must learn them as he needs them. The simplest way of\\naccomplishing this is for each generation to copy the ways of doing\\nthings which are followed by the older generation among whom they are\\nborn. This is done largely through _imitation_.\\n\\nNATURE OF IMITATION.--_Imitation is the instinct to respond to a\\nsuggestion from another by repeating his act._ The instinct of\\nimitation is active in the year-old child, it requires another year or\\ntwo to reach its height, then it gradually grows less marked, but\\ncontinues in some degree throughout life. The young child is practically\\nhelpless in the matter of imitation. Instinct demands that he shall\\nimitate, and he has no choice but to obey. His environment furnishes the\\nmodels which he must imitate, whether they are good or bad. Before he is\\nold enough for intelligent choice, he has imitated a multitude of acts\\nabout him; and habit has seized upon these acts and is weaving them into\\nconduct and character. Older grown we may choose what we will imitate,\\nbut in our earlier years we are at the mercy of the models which are\\nplaced before us.\\n\\nIf our mother tongue is the first we hear spoken, that will be our\\nlanguage; but if we first hear Chinese, we will learn that with almost\\nequal facility. If whatever speech we hear is well spoken, correct, and\\nbeautiful, so will our language be; if it is vulgar, or incorrect, or\\nslangy, our speech will be of this kind. If the first manners which\\nserve us as models are coarse and boorish, ours will resemble them; if\\nthey are cultivated and refined, ours will be like them. If our models\\nof conduct and morals are questionable, our conduct and morals will be\\nof like type. Our manner of walking, of dressing, of thinking, of saying\\nour prayers, even, originates in imitation. By imitation we adopt\\nready-made our social standards, our political faith, and our religious\\ncreeds. Our views of life and the values we set on its attainments are\\nlargely a matter of imitation.\\n\\nINDIVIDUALITY IN IMITATION.--Yet, given the same model, no two of us\\nwill imitate precisely alike. Your acts will be yours, and mine will be\\nmine. This is because no two of us have just the same heredity, and\\nhence cannot have precisely similar instincts. There reside in our\\ndifferent personalities different powers of invention and originality,\\nand these determine by how much the product of imitation will vary from\\nthe model. Some remain imitators all their lives, while others use\\nimitation as a means to the invention of better types than the original\\nmodels. The person who is an imitator only, lacks individuality and\\ninitiative; the nation which is an imitator only is stagnant and\\nunprogressive. While imitation must be blind in both cases at first, it\\nshould be increasingly intelligent as the individual or the nation\\nprogresses.\\n\\nCONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS IMITATION.--The much-quoted dictum that \"all\\nconsciousness is motor\" has a direct application to imitation. It only\\nmeans that _we have a tendency to act on whatever idea occupies the\\nmind_. Think of yawning or clearing the throat, and the tendency is\\nstrong to do these things. We naturally respond to smile with smile and\\nto frown with frown. And even the impressions coming to us from our\\nmaterial environment have their influence on our acts. Our response to\\nthese ideas may be a conscious one, as when a boy purposely stutters in\\norder to mimic an unfortunate companion; or it may be unconscious, as\\nwhen the boy unknowingly falls into the habit of stammering from hearing\\nthis kind of speech. The child may consciously seek to keep himself neat\\nand clean so as to harmonize with a pleasant and well-kept home, or he\\nmay unconsciously become slovenly and cross-tempered from living in an\\nill-kept home where constant bickering is the rule.\\n\\nOften we deliberately imitate what seems to us desirable in other\\npeople, but probably far the greater proportion of the suggestions to\\nwhich we respond are received and acted upon unconsciously. In\\nconscious imitation we can select what models we shall imitate, and\\ntherefore protect ourselves in so far as our judgment of good and bad\\nmodels is valid. In unconscious imitation, however, we are constantly\\nresponding to a stream of suggestions pouring in upon us hour after hour\\nand day after day, with no protection but the leadings of our interests\\nas they direct our attention now to this phase of our environment, and\\nnow to that.\\n\\nINFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT.--No small part of the influences which mold\\nour lives comes from our material environment. Good clothes, artistic\\nhomes, beautiful pictures and decoration, attractive parks and lawns,\\nwell-kept streets, well-bound books--all these have a direct moral and\\neducative value; on the other hand, squalor, disorder, and ugliness are\\nan incentive to ignorance and crime.\\n\\nHawthorne tells in \"The Great Stone Face\" of the boy Ernest, listening\\nto the tradition of a coming Wise Man who one day is to rule over the\\nValley. The story sinks deep into the boy\\'s heart, and he thinks and\\ndreams of the great and good man; and as he thinks and dreams, he spends\\nhis boyhood days gazing across the valley at a distant mountain side\\nwhose rocks and cliffs nature had formed into the outlines of a human\\nface remarkable for the nobleness and benignity of its expression. He\\ncomes to love this Face and looks upon it as the prototype of the coming\\nWise Man, until lo! as he dwells upon it and dreams about it, the\\nbeautiful character which its expression typifies grows into his own\\nlife, and he himself becomes the long-looked-for Wise Man.\\n\\nTHE INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY.--More powerful than the influence of\\nmaterial environment, however, is that of other personalities upon\\nus--the touch of life upon life. A living personality contains a power\\nwhich grips hold of us, electrifies us, inspires us, and compels us to\\nnew endeavor, or else degrades and debases us. None has failed to feel\\nat some time this life-touch, and to bless or curse the day when its\\ninfluence came upon him. Either consciously or unconsciously such a\\npersonality becomes our ideal and model; we idolize it, idealize it, and\\nimitate it, until it becomes a part of us. Not only do we find these\\ngreat personalities living in the flesh, but we find them also in books,\\nfrom whose pages they speak to us, and to whose influence we respond.\\n\\nAnd not in the _great_ personalities alone does the power to influence\\nreside. From _every life_ which touches ours, a stream of influence\\ngreat or small is entering our life and helping to mold it. Nor are we\\nto forget that this influence is reciprocal, and that we are reacting\\nupon others up to the measure of the powers that are in us.\\n\\n\\n4. THE INSTINCT OF PLAY\\n\\nSmall use to be a child unless one can play. Says Karl Groos: \"Perhaps\\nthe very existence of youth is due in part to the necessity for play;\\nthe animal does not play because he is young, but he is young because he\\nmust play.\" Play is a constant factor in all grades of animal life. The\\nswarming insects, the playful kitten, the frisking lambs, the racing\\ncolt, the darting swallows, the maddening aggregation of\\nblackbirds--these are but illustrations of the common impulse of all the\\nanimal world to play. Wherever freedom and happiness reside, there play\\nis found; wherever play is lacking, there the curse has fallen and\\nsadness and oppression reign. Play is the natural rôle in the paradise\\nof youth; it is childhood\\'s chief occupation. To toil without play,\\nplaces man on a level with the beasts of burden.\\n\\nTHE NECESSITY FOR PLAY.--But why is play so necessary? Why is this\\nimpulse so deep-rooted in our natures? Why not compel our young to\\nexpend their boundless energy on productive labor? Why all this waste?\\nWhy have our child labor laws? Why not shut recesses from our schools,\\nand so save time for work? Is it true that all work and no play makes\\nJack a dull boy? Too true. For proof we need but gaze at the dull and\\nlifeless faces of the prematurely old children as they pour out of the\\nfactories where child labor is employed. We need but follow the\\nchildren, who have had a playless childhood, into a narrow and barren\\nmanhood. We need but to trace back the history of the dull and brutish\\nmen of today, and find that they were the playless children of\\nyesterday. Play is as necessary to the child as food, as vital as\\nsunshine, as indispensable as air.\\n\\nThe keynote of play is _freedom_, freedom of physical activity, and\\nmental initiative. In play the child makes his own plans, his\\nimagination has free rein, originality is in demand, and constructive\\nability is placed under tribute. Here are developed a thousand\\ntendencies which would never find expression in the narrow treadmill of\\nlabor alone. The child needs to learn to work; but along with his work\\nmust be the opportunity for free and unrestricted activity, which can\\ncome only through play. The boy needs a chance to be a barbarian, a\\nhero, an Indian. He needs to ride his broomstick on a dangerous raid,\\nand to charge with lath sword the redoubts of a stubborn enemy. He needs\\nto be a leader as well as a follower. In short, without in the least\\nbeing aware of it, he needs to develop himself through his own\\nactivity--he needs freedom to play. If the child be a girl, there is no\\ndifference except in the character of the activities employed.\\n\\nPLAY IN DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION.--And it is precisely out of these\\nplay activities that the later and more serious activities of life\\nemerge. Play is the gateway by which we best enter the various fields of\\nthe world\\'s work, whether our particular sphere be that of pupil or\\nteacher in the schoolroom, of man in the busy marts of trade or in the\\nprofessions, or of farmer or mechanic. Play brings the _whole self_ into\\nthe activity; it trains to habits of independence and individual\\ninitiative, to strenuous and sustained effort, to endurance of hardship\\nand fatigue, to social participation and the acceptance of victory and\\ndefeat. And these are the qualities needed by the man of success in his\\nvocation.\\n\\nThese facts make the play instinct one of the most important in\\neducation. Froebel was the first to recognize the importance of play,\\nand the kindergarten was an attempt to utilize its activities in the\\nschool. The introduction of this new factor into education has been\\nattended, as might be expected, by many mistakes. Some have thought to\\nrecast the entire process of education into the form of games and plays,\\nand thus to lead the child to possess the \"Promised Land\" through\\naimlessly chasing butterflies in the pleasant fields of knowledge. It is\\nneedless to say that they have not succeeded. Others have mistaken the\\nshadow for the substance, and introduced games and plays into the\\nschoolroom which lack the very first element of play; namely, _freedom\\nof initiative and action_ on the part of the child. Educational\\ntheorists and teachers have invented games and occupations and taught\\nthem to the children, who go through with them much as they would with\\nany other task, enjoying the activity but missing the development which\\nwould come through a larger measure of self-direction.\\n\\nWORK AND PLAY ARE COMPLEMENTS.--Work cannot take the place of play,\\nneither can play be substituted for work. Nor are the two antagonistic,\\nbut each is the complement of the other; for the activities of work grow\\nimmediately out of those of play, and each lends zest to the other.\\nThose who have never learned to work and those who have never learned to\\nplay are equally lacking in their development. Further, it is not the\\nname or character of an activity which determines whether it is play for\\nthe participant, but _his attitude toward the activity_. If the activity\\nis performed for its own sake and not for some ulterior end, if it grows\\nout of the interest of the child and involves the free and independent\\nuse of his powers of body and mind, if it is _his_, and not someone\\'s\\nelse--then the activity possesses the chief characteristics of play.\\nLacking these, it cannot be play, whatever else it may be.\\n\\nPlay, like other instincts, besides serving the present, looks in two\\ndirections, into the past and into the future. From the past come the\\nshadowy interests which, taking form from the touch of our environment,\\ndetermine the character of the play activities. From the future come the\\npremonitions of the activities that are to be. The boy adjusting himself\\nto the requirements of the game, seeking control over his companions or\\ngiving in to them, is practicing in miniature the larger game which he\\nwill play in business or profession a little later. The girl in her\\nplayhouse, surrounded by a nondescript family of dolls and pets, is\\nunconsciously looking forward to a more perfect life when the\\nresponsibilities shall be a little more real. So let us not grudge our\\nchildren the play day of youth.\\n\\n\\n5. OTHER USEFUL INSTINCTS\\n\\nMany other instincts ripen during the stage of youth and play their part\\nin the development of the individual.\\n\\nCURIOSITY.--It is inherent in every normal person to want to investigate\\nand _know_. The child looks out with wonder and fascination on a world\\nhe does not understand, and at once begins to ask questions and try\\nexperiments. Every new object is approached in a spirit of inquiry.\\nInterest is omnivorous, feeding upon every phase of environment. Nothing\\nis too simple or too complex to demand attention and exploration, so\\nthat it vitally touches the child\\'s activities and experience.\\n\\nThe momentum given the individual by curiosity toward learning and\\nmastering his world is incalculable. Imagine the impossible task of\\nteaching children what they had no desire or inclination to know! Think\\nof trying to lead them to investigate matters concerning which they felt\\nonly a supreme indifference! Indeed one of the greatest problems of\\neducation is to keep curiosity alive and fresh so that its compelling\\ninfluence may promote effort and action. One of the greatest secrets of\\neternal youth is also found in retaining the spontaneous curiosity of\\nyouth after the youthful years are past.\\n\\nMANIPULATION.--This is the rather unsatisfactory name for the universal\\ntendency to _handle_, _do_ or _make_ something. The young child builds\\nwith its blocks, constructs fences and pens and caves and houses, and a\\nscore of other objects. The older child, supplied with implements and\\ntools, enters upon more ambitious projects and revels in the joy of\\ncreation as he makes boats and boxes, soldiers and swords, kites,\\nplay-houses and what-not. Even as adults we are moved by a desire to\\nexpress ourselves through making or creating that which will represent\\nour ingenuity and skill. The tendency of children to destroy is not from\\nwantonness, but rather from a desire to manipulate.\\n\\nEducation has but recently begun to make serious use of this important\\nimpulse. The success of all laboratory methods of teaching, and of such\\nsubjects as manual training and domestic science, is abundant proof of\\nthe adage that we learn by doing. We would rather construct or\\nmanipulate an object than merely learn its verbal description. Our\\ndeepest impulses lead to creation rather than simple mental\\nappropriation of facts and descriptions.\\n\\nTHE COLLECTING INSTINCT.--The words _my_ and _mine_ enter the child\\'s\\nvocabulary at a very early age. The sense of property ownership and the\\nimpulse to make collections of various kinds go hand in hand. Probably\\nthere are few of us who have not at one time or another made collections\\nof autographs, postage stamps, coins, bugs, or some other thing of as\\nlittle intrinsic value. And most of us, if we have left youth behind,\\nare busy even now in seeking to collect fortunes, works of art, rare\\nvolumes or other objects on which we have set our hearts.\\n\\nThe collecting instinct and the impulse to ownership can be made\\nimportant agents in the school. The child who, in nature study,\\ngeography or agriculture, is making a collection of the leaves, plants,\\nsoils, fruits, or insects used in the lessons has an incentive to\\nobservation and investigation impossible from book instruction alone.\\nOne who, in manual training or domestic science, is allowed to own the\\narticle made will give more effort and skill to its construction than if\\nthe work be done as a mere school task.\\n\\nTHE DRAMATIC INSTINCT.--Every person is, at one stage of his\\ndevelopment, something of an actor. All children like to \"dress up\" and\\nimpersonate someone else--in proof of which, witness the many play\\nscenes in which the character of nurse, doctor, pirate, teacher,\\nmerchant or explorer is taken by children who, under the stimulus of\\ntheir spontaneous imagery and as yet untrammeled by self-consciousness,\\nfreely enter into the character they portray. The dramatic impulse never\\nwholly dies out. When we no longer aspire to do the acting ourselves we\\nhave others do it for us in the theaters or the movies.\\n\\nEducation finds in the dramatic instinct a valuable aid. Progressive\\nteachers are using it freely, especially in the teaching of literature\\nand history. Its application to these fields may be greatly increased,\\nand also extended more generally to include religion, morals, and art.\\n\\nTHE IMPULSE TO FORM GANGS AND CLUBS.--Few boys and girls grow up without\\nbelonging at some time to a secret gang, club or society. Usually this\\nimpulse grows out of two different instincts, the _social_ and the\\n_adventurous_. It is fundamental in our natures to wish to be with our\\nkind--not only our human kind, but those of the same age, interests and\\nambitions. The love of secrecy and adventure is also deep seated in us.\\nSo we are clannish; and we love to do the unusual, to break away from\\nthe commonplace and routine of our lives. There is often a thrill of\\nsatisfaction--even if it be later followed by remorse--in doing the\\nforbidden or the unconventional.\\n\\nThe problem here as in the case of many other instincts is one of\\nguidance rather than of repression. Out of the gang impulse we may\\ndevelop our athletic teams, our debating and dramatic clubs, our\\ntramping clubs, and a score of other recreational, benevolent, or\\nsocial organizations. Not repression, but proper expression should be\\nour ideal.\\n\\n\\n6. FEAR\\n\\nProbably in no instinct more than in that of fear can we find the\\nreflections of all the past ages of life in the world with its manifold\\nchanges, its dangers, its tragedies, its sufferings, and its deaths.\\n\\nFEAR HEREDITY.--The fears of childhood \"are remembered at every step,\"\\nand so are the fears through which the race has passed. Says\\nChamberlain: \"Every ugly thing told to the child, every shock, every\\nfright given him, will remain like splinters in the flesh, to torture\\nhim all his life long. The bravest old soldier, the most daring young\\nreprobate, is incapable of forgetting them all--the masks, the bogies,\\nogres, hobgoblins, witches, and wizards, the things that bite and\\nscratch, that nip and tear, that pinch and crunch, the thousand and one\\nimaginary monsters of the mother, the nurse, or the servant, have had\\ntheir effect; and hundreds of generations have worked to denaturalize\\nthe brains of children. Perhaps no animal, not even those most\\nsusceptible to fright, has behind it the fear heredity of the child.\"\\n\\nPresident Hall calls attention to the fact that night is now the safest\\ntime of the twenty-four hours; serpents are no longer our most deadly\\nenemies; strangers are not to be feared; neither are big eyes or teeth;\\nthere is no adequate reason why the wind, or thunder, or lightning\\nshould make children frantic as they do. But \"the past of man forever\\nseems to linger in his present\"; and the child, in being afraid of these\\nthings, is only summing up the fear experiences of the race and\\nsuffering all too many of them in his short childhood.\\n\\nFEAR OF THE DARK.--Most children are afraid in the dark. Who does not\\nremember the terror of a dark room through which he had to pass, or,\\nworse still, in which he had to go to bed alone, and there lie in cold\\nperspiration induced by a mortal agony of fright! The unused doors which\\nwould not lock, and through which he expected to see the goblin come\\nforth to get him! The dark shadows back under the bed where he was\\nafraid to look for the hidden monster which he was sure was hiding there\\nand yet dare not face! The lonely lane through which the cows were to be\\ndriven late at night, while every fence corner bristled with shapeless\\nmonsters lying in wait for boys!\\n\\nAnd that hated dark closet where he was shut up \"until he could learn to\\nbe good!\" And the useless trapdoor in the ceiling. How often have we\\nlain in the dim light at night and seen the lid lift just a peep for\\nogre eyes to peer out, and, when the terror was growing beyond\\nendurance, close down, only to lift once and again, until from sheer\\nweariness and exhaustion we fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed of\\nthe hideous monster which inhabited the unused garret! Tell me that the\\nold trapdoor never bent its hinges in response to either man or monster\\nfor twenty years? I know it is true, and yet I am not convinced. My\\nchildish fears have left a stronger impression than proof of mere facts\\ncan ever overrule.\\n\\nFEAR OF BEING LEFT ALONE.--And the fear of being left alone. How big and\\ndreadful the house seemed with the folks all gone! How we suddenly made\\nclose friends with the dog or the cat, even, in order that this bit of\\nlife might be near us! Or, failing in this, we have gone out to the barn\\namong the chickens and the pigs and the cows, and deserted the empty\\nhouse with its torture of loneliness. What was there so terrible in\\nbeing alone? I do not know. I know only that to many children it is a\\ntorture more exquisite than the adult organism is fitted to experience.\\n\\nBut why multiply the recollections? They bring a tremor to the strongest\\nof us today. Who of us would choose to live through those childish fears\\nagain? Dream fears, fears of animals, fears of furry things, fears of\\nghosts and of death, dread of fatal diseases, fears of fire and of\\nwater, of strange persons, of storms, fears of things unknown and even\\nunimagined, but all the more fearful! Would you all like to relive your\\nchildhood for its pleasures if you had to take along with them its\\nsufferings? Would the race choose to live its evolution over again? I do\\nnot know. But, for my own part, I should very much hesitate to turn the\\nhands of time backward in either case. Would that the adults at life\\'s\\nnoonday, in remembering the childish fears of life\\'s morning, might feel\\na sympathy for the children of today, who are not yet escaped from the\\nbonds of the fear instinct. Would that all might seek to quiet every\\nfoolish childish fear, instead of laughing at it or enhancing it!\\n\\n\\n7. OTHER UNDESIRABLE INSTINCTS\\n\\nWe are all provided by nature with some instincts which, while they may\\nserve a good purpose in our development, need to be suppressed or at\\nleast modified when they have done their work.\\n\\nSELFISHNESS.--All children, and perhaps all adults, are selfish. The\\nlittle child will appropriate all the candy, and give none to his\\nplaymate. He will grow angry and fight rather than allow brother or\\nsister to use a favorite plaything. He will demand the mother\\'s\\nattention and care even when told that she is tired or ill, and not\\nable to minister to him. But all of this is true to nature and, though\\nit needs to be changed to generosity and unselfishness, is, after all, a\\nvital factor in our natures. For it is better in the long run that each\\none _should_ look out for himself, rather than to be so careless of his\\nown interests and needs as to require help from others. The problem in\\neducation is so to balance selfishness and greed with unselfishness and\\ngenerosity that each serves as a check and a balance to the other. Not\\nelimination but equilibrium is to be our watchword.\\n\\nPUGNACITY, OR THE FIGHTING IMPULSE.--Almost every normal child is a\\nnatural fighter, just as every adult should possess the spirit of\\nconquest. The long history of conflict through which our race has come\\nhas left its mark in our love of combat. The pugnacity of children,\\nespecially of boys, is not so much to be deprecated and suppressed as\\nguided into right lines and rendered subject to right ideals. The boy\\nwho picks a quarrel has been done a kindness when given a drubbing that\\nwill check this tendency. On the other hand, one who risks battle in\\ndefense of a weaker comrade does no ignoble thing. Children need very\\nearly to be taught the baseness of fighting for the sake of conflict,\\nand the glory of going down to defeat fighting in a righteous cause. The\\nworld could well stand more of this spirit among adults!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nLet us then hear the conclusion of the whole matter. The undesirable\\ninstincts do not need encouragement. It is better to let them fade away\\nfrom disuse, or in some cases even by attaching punishment to their\\nexpression. They are echoes from a distant past, and not serviceable in\\nthis better present. _The desirable instincts we are to seize upon and\\nutilize as starting points for the development of useful interests,\\ngood habits, and the higher emotional life. We should take them as they\\ncome, for their appearance is a sure sign that the organism is ready for\\nand needs the activity they foreshadow; and, furthermore, if they are\\nnot used when they present themselves, they disappear, never to return._\\n\\n\\n8. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. What instincts have you noticed developing in children? What ones\\nhave you observed to fade away? Can you fix the age in both cases? Apply\\nthese questions to your own development as you remember it or can get it\\nby tradition from your elders.\\n\\n2. What use of imitation may be made in teaching (1) literature, (2)\\ncomposition, (3) music, (4) good manners, (5) morals?\\n\\n3. Should children be _taught_ to play? Make a list of the games you\\nthink all children should know and be able to play. It has been said\\nthat it is as important for a people to be able to use their leisure\\ntime wisely as to use their work time profitably. Why should this be\\ntrue?\\n\\n4. Observe the instruction of children to discover the extent to which\\nuse is made of the _constructive_ instinct. The _collecting_ instinct.\\nThe _dramatic_ instinct. Describe a plan by which each of these\\ninstincts can be successfully used in some branch of study.\\n\\n5. What examples can you recount from your own experience of conscious\\nimitation? of unconscious imitation? of the influence of environment?\\nWhat is the application of the preceding question to the esthetic\\nquality of our school buildings?\\n\\n6. Have you ever observed that children under a dozen years of age\\nusually cannot be depended upon for \"team work\" in their games? How do\\nyou explain this fact?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nFEELING AND ITS FUNCTIONS\\n\\n\\nIn the psychical world as well as the physical we must meet and overcome\\ninertia. Our lives must be compelled by motive forces strong enough to\\novercome this natural inertia, and enable us besides to make headway\\nagainst many obstacles. _The motive power that drives us consists\\nchiefly of our feelings and emotions._ Knowledge, cognition, supplies\\nthe rudder that guides our ship, but feeling and emotion supply the\\npower.\\n\\nTo convince one\\'s head is, therefore, not enough; his feelings must be\\nstirred if you would be sure of moving him to action. Often have we\\n_known_ that a certain line of action was right, but failed to follow it\\nbecause feeling led in a different direction. When decision has been\\nhanging in the balance we have piled on one side obligation, duty, sense\\nof right, and a dozen other reasons for action, only to have them all\\noutweighed by the one single: _It is disagreeable._ Judgment, reason,\\nand experience may unite to tell us that a contemplated course is\\nunwise, and imagination may reveal to us its disastrous consequences,\\nand yet its pleasures so appeal to us that we yield. Our feelings often\\nprove a stronger motive than knowledge and will combined; they are a\\nfactor constantly to be reckoned with among our motives.\\n\\n\\n1. THE NATURE OF FEELING\\n\\nIt will be our purpose in the next few chapters to study the _affective_\\ncontent of consciousness--the feelings and emotions. The present chapter\\nwill be devoted to the feelings and the one that follows to the\\nemotions.\\n\\nTHE DIFFERENT FEELING QUALITIES.--At least six (some writers say even\\nmore) distinct and qualitatively different feeling states are easily\\ndistinguished. These are: _pleasure_, _pain_; _desire_, _repugnance_;\\n_interest_, _apathy._ Pleasure and pain, and desire and repugnance, are\\ndirectly opposite or antagonistic feelings. Interest and apathy are not\\nopposites in a similar way, since apathy is but the absence of interest,\\nand not its antagonist. In place of the terms pleasure and pain, the\\n_pleasant_ and the _unpleasant_, or the _agreeable_ and the\\n_disagreeable_, are often used. _Aversion_ is frequently employed as a\\nsynonym for repugnance.\\n\\nIt is somewhat hard to believe on first thought that feeling comprises\\nbut the classes given. For have we not often felt the pain from a\\ntoothache, from not being able to take a long-planned trip, from the\\nloss of a dear friend? Surely these are very different classes of\\nfeelings! Likewise we have been happy from the very joy of living, from\\nbeing praised for some well-doing, or from the presence of friend or\\nlover. And here again we seem to have widely different classes of\\nfeelings.\\n\\nWe must remember, however, that feeling is always based on something\\n_known_. It never appears alone in consciousness as _mere_ pleasures or\\npains. The mind must have something about which to feel. The \"what\" must\\nprecede the \"how.\" What we commonly call a feeling _is a complex state\\nof consciousness in which feeling predominates_, but which has,\\nnevertheless, _a basis of sensation, or memory, or some other cognitive\\nprocess_. And what so greatly varies in the different cases of the\\nillustrations just given is precisely this knowledge element, and not\\nthe feeling element. A feeling of unpleasantness is a feeling of\\nunpleasantness whether it comes from an aching tooth or from the loss of\\na friend. It may differ in degree, and the entire mental states of which\\nthe feeling is a part may differ vastly, but the simple feeling itself\\nis of the same quality.\\n\\nFEELING ALWAYS PRESENT IN MENTAL CONTENT.--No phase of our mental life\\nis without the feeling element. We look at the rainbow with its\\nbeautiful and harmonious blending of colors, and a feeling of pleasure\\naccompanies the sensation; then we turn and gaze at the glaring sun, and\\na disagreeable feeling is the result. A strong feeling of pleasantness\\naccompanies the experience of the voluptuous warmth of a cozy bed on a\\ncold morning, but the plunge between the icy sheets on the preceding\\nevening was accompanied by the opposite feeling. The touch of a hand may\\noccasion a thrill of ecstatic pleasure, or it may be accompanied by a\\nfeeling equally disagreeable. And so on through the whole range of\\nsensation; we not only _know_ the various objects about us through\\nsensation and perception, but we also _feel_ while we know. Cognition,\\nor the knowing processes, gives us our \"whats\"; and feeling, or the\\naffective processes, gives us our \"hows.\" What is yonder object? A\\nbouquet. How does it affect you? Pleasurably.\\n\\nIf, instead of the simpler sensory processes which we have just\\nconsidered, we take the more complex processes, such as memory,\\nimagination, and thinking, the case is no different. Who has not reveled\\nin the pleasure accompanying the memories of past joys? On the other\\nhand, who is free from all unpleasant memories--from regrets, from pangs\\nof remorse? Who has not dreamed away an hour in pleasant anticipation of\\nsome desired object, or spent a miserable hour in dreading some calamity\\nwhich imagination pictured to him? Feeling also accompanies our thought\\nprocesses. Everyone has experienced the feeling of the pleasure of\\nintellectual victory over some difficult problem which had baffled the\\nreason, or over some doubtful case in which our judgment proved correct.\\nAnd likewise none has escaped the feeling of unpleasantness which\\naccompanies intellectual defeat. Whatever the contents of our mental\\nstream, \"we find in them, everywhere present, a certain color of passing\\nestimate, an immediate sense that they are worth something to us at any\\ngiven moment, or that they then have an interest to us.\"\\n\\nTHE SEEMING NEUTRAL FEELING ZONE.--It is probable that there is so\\nlittle feeling connected with many of the humdrum and habitual\\nexperiences of our everyday lives, that we are but slightly, if at all,\\naware of a feeling state in connection with them. Yet a state of\\nconsciousness with absolutely no feeling side to it is as unthinkable as\\nthe obverse side of a coin without the reverse. Some sort of feeling\\ntone or mood is always present. The width of the affective neutral\\nzone--that is, of a feeling state so little marked as not to be\\ndiscriminated as either pleasure or pain, desire or aversion--varies\\nwith different persons, and with the same person at different times. It\\nis conditioned largely by the amount of attention given in the direction\\nof feeling, and also on the fineness of the power of feeling\\ndiscrimination. It is safe to say that the zero range is usually so\\nsmall as to be negligible.\\n\\n\\n2. MOOD AND DISPOSITION\\n\\nThe sum total of all the feeling accompanying the various sensory and\\nthought processes at any given time results in what we may call our\\n_feeling tone_, _or mood._\\n\\nHOW MOOD IS PRODUCED.--During most of our waking hours, and, indeed,\\nduring our sleeping hours as well, a multitude of sensory currents are\\npouring into the cortical centers. At the present moment we can hear the\\nrumble of a wagon, the chirp of a cricket, the chatter of distant\\nvoices, and a hundred other sounds besides. At the same time the eye is\\nappealed to by an infinite variety of stimuli in light, color, and\\nobjects; the skin responds to many contacts and temperatures; and every\\nother type of end-organ of the body is acting as a \"sender\" to telegraph\\na message in to the brain. Add to these the powerful currents which are\\nconstantly being sent to the cortex from the visceral organs--those of\\nrespiration, of circulation, of digestion and assimilation. And then\\nfinally add the central processes which accompany the flight of images\\nthrough our minds--our meditations, memories, and imaginations, our\\ncogitations and volitions.\\n\\nThus we see what a complex our feelings must be, and how impossible to\\nhave any moment in which some feeling is not present as a part of our\\nmental stream. It is this complex, now made up chiefly on the basis of\\nthe sensory currents coming in from the end-organs or the visceral\\norgans, and now on the basis of those in the cortex connected with our\\nthought life, which constitutes the entire feeling tone, or _mood_.\\n\\nMOOD COLORS ALL OUR THINKING.--Mood depends on the character of the\\naggregate of nerve currents entering the cortex, and changes as the\\ncharacter of the current varies. If the currents run on much the same\\nfrom hour to hour, then our mood is correspondingly constant; if the\\ncurrents are variable, our mood also will be variable. Not only is mood\\ndependent on our sensations and thoughts for its quality, but it in turn\\ncolors our entire mental life. It serves as a background or setting\\nwhose hue is reflected over all our thinking. Let the mood be somber and\\ndark, and all the world looks gloomy; on the other hand, let the mood be\\nbright and cheerful, and the world puts on a smile.\\n\\nIt is told of one of the early circuit riders among the New England\\nministry, that he made the following entries in his diary, thus well\\nillustrating the point: \"Wed. Eve. Arrived at the home of Bro. Brown\\nlate this evening, hungry and tired after a long day in the saddle. Had\\na bountiful supper of cold pork and beans, warm bread, bacon and eggs,\\ncoffee, and rich pastry. I go to rest feeling that my witness is clear;\\nthe future is bright; I feel called to a great and glorious work in this\\nplace. Bro. Brown\\'s family are godly people.\" The next entry was as\\nfollows: \"Thur. Morn. Awakened late this morning after a troubled night.\\nI am very much depressed in soul; the way looks dark; far from feeling\\ncalled to work among this people, I am beginning to doubt the safety of\\nmy own soul. I am afraid the desires of Bro. Brown and his family are\\nset too much on carnal things.\" A dyspeptic is usually a pessimist, and\\nan optimist always keeps a bright mood.\\n\\nMOOD INFLUENCES OUR JUDGMENTS AND DECISIONS.--The prattle of children\\nmay be grateful music to our ears when we are in one mood, and\\nexcruciatingly discordant noise when we are in another. What appeals to\\nus as a good practical joke one day, may seem a piece of unwarranted\\nimpertinence on another. A proposition which looks entirely plausible\\nunder the sanguine mood induced by a persuasive orator, may appear\\nwholly untenable a few hours later. Decisions which seemed warranted\\nwhen we were in an angry mood, often appear unwise or unjust when we\\nhave become more calm. Motives which easily impel us to action when the\\nworld looks bright, fail to move us when the mood is somber. The\\nfeelings of impending peril and calamity which are an inevitable\\naccompaniment of the \"blues,\" are speedily dissipated when the sun\\nbreaks through the clouds and we are ourselves again.\\n\\nMOOD INFLUENCES EFFORT.--A bright and hopeful mood quickens every power\\nand enhances every effort, while a hopeless mood limits power and\\ncripples effort. The football team which goes into the game discouraged\\nnever plays to the limit. The student who attacks his lesson under the\\nconviction of defeat can hardly hope to succeed, while the one who\\nenters upon his work confident of his power to master it has the battle\\nalready half won. The world\\'s best work is done not by those who live in\\nthe shadow of discouragement and doubt, but by those in whose breast\\nhope springs eternal. The optimist is a benefactor of the race if for no\\nother reason than the sheer contagion of his hopeful spirit; the\\npessimist contributes neither to the world\\'s welfare nor its happiness.\\nYouth\\'s proverbial enthusiasm and dauntless energy rest upon the supreme\\nhopefulness which characterizes the mood of the young. For these\\nreasons, if for no other, the mood of the schoolroom should be one of\\nhappiness and good cheer.\\n\\nDISPOSITION A RESULTANT OF MOODS.--The sum total of our moods gives us\\nour _disposition_. Whether these are pleasant or unpleasant, cheerful or\\ngloomy, will depend on the predominating character of the moods which\\nenter into them. As well expect to gather grapes of thorns or figs of\\nthistles, as to secure a desirable disposition out of undesirable moods.\\nA sunny disposition never comes from gloomy moods, nor a hopeful one out\\nof the \"blues.\" And it is our disposition, more than the power of our\\nreason, which, after all, determines our desirability as friends and\\ncompanions.\\n\\nThe person of surly disposition can hardly make a desirable companion,\\nno matter what his intellectual qualities may be. We may live very\\nhappily with one who cannot follow the reasoning of a Newton, but it is\\nhard to live with a person chronically subject to \"black moods.\" Nor can\\nwe put the responsibility for our disposition off on our ancestors. It\\nis not an inheritance, but a growth. Slowly, day by day, and mood by\\nmood, we build up our disposition until finally it comes to characterize\\nus.\\n\\nTEMPERAMENT.--Some are, however, more predisposed to certain types of\\nmood than are others. The organization of our nervous system which we\\nget through heredity undoubtedly has much to do with the feeling tone\\ninto which we most easily fall. We call this predisposition\\n_temperament_. On the effects of temperament, our ancestors must divide\\nthe responsibility with us. I say _divide_ the responsibility, for even\\nif we find ourselves predisposed toward a certain undesirable type of\\nmoods, there is no reason why we should give up to them. Even in spite\\nof hereditary predispositions, we can still largely determine for\\nourselves what our moods are to be.\\n\\nIf we have a tendency toward cheerful, quiet, and optimistic moods, the\\npsychologist names our temperament the _sanguine_; if we are tense,\\neasily excited and irritable, with a tendency toward sullen or angry\\nmoods, the _choleric_; if we are given to frequent fits of the \"blues,\"\\nif we usually look on the dark side of things and have a tendency toward\\nmoods of discouragement and the \"dumps,\" the _melancholic_; if hard to\\nrouse, and given to indolent and indifferent moods, the _phlegmatic_.\\nWhatever be our temperament, it is one of the most important factors in\\nour character.\\n\\n\\n3. PERMANENT FEELING ATTITUDES, OR SENTIMENTS\\n\\nBesides the more or less transitory feeling states which we have called\\nmoods, there exists also a class of feeling attitudes, which contain\\nmore of the complex intellectual element, are withal of rather a higher\\nnature, and much more permanent than our moods. We may call these our\\n_sentiments_, or _attitudes_. Our sentiments comprise the somewhat\\nconstant level of feeling combined with cognition, which we name\\n_sympathy_, _friendship_, _love_, _patriotism_, _religious faith_,\\n_selfishness_, _pride_, _vanity, etc._ Like our dispositions, our\\nsentiments are a growth of months and years. Unlike our dispositions,\\nhowever, our sentiments are relatively independent of the physiological\\nundertone, and depend more largely upon long-continued experience and\\nintellectual elements as a basis. A sluggish liver might throw us into\\nan irritable mood and, if the condition were long continued, might\\nresult in a surly disposition; but it would hardly permanently destroy\\none\\'s patriotism and make him turn traitor to his country. One\\'s feeling\\nattitude on such matters is too deep seated to be modified by changing\\nwhims.\\n\\nHOW SENTIMENTS DEVELOP.--Sentiments have their beginning in concrete\\nexperiences in which feeling is a predominant element, and grow through\\nthe multiplication of these experiences much as the concept is\\ndeveloped through many percepts. There is a residual element left\\nbehind each separate experience in both cases. In the case of the\\nconcept the residual element is intellectual, and in the case of the\\nsentiment it is a complex in which the feeling element is predominant.\\n\\nHow this comes about is easily seen by means of an illustration or two.\\nThe mother feeds her child when he is hungry, and an agreeable feeling\\nis produced; she puts him into the bath and snuggles him in her arms,\\nand the experiences are pleasant. The child comes to look upon the\\nmother as one whose especial function is to make things pleasant for\\nhim, so he comes to be happy in her presence, and long for her in her\\nabsence. He finally grows to love his mother not alone for the countless\\ntimes she has given him pleasure, but for what she herself is. The\\nfeelings connected at first wholly with pleasant experiences coming\\nthrough the ministrations of the mother, strengthened no doubt by\\ninstinctive tendencies toward affection, and later enhanced by a fuller\\nrealization of what a mother\\'s care and sacrifice mean, grow at last\\ninto a deep, forceful, abiding sentiment of love for the mother.\\n\\nTHE EFFECT OF EXPERIENCE.--Likewise with the sentiment of patriotism. In\\nso far as our patriotism is a true patriotism and not a noisy clamor, it\\nhad its rise in feelings of gratitude and love when we contemplated the\\ndeeds of heroism and sacrifice for the flag, and the blessings which\\ncome to us from our relations as citizens to our country. If we have had\\nconcrete cases brought to our experience, as, for example, our property\\nsaved from destruction at the hands of a mob or our lives saved from a\\nhostile foreign foe, the patriotic sentiment will be all the stronger.\\n\\nSo we may carry the illustration into all the sentiments. Our religious\\nsentiments of adoration, love, and faith have their origin in our belief\\nin the care, love, and support from a higher Being typified to us as\\nchildren by the care, love, and support of our parents. Pride arises\\nfrom the appreciation or over-appreciation of oneself, his attainments,\\nor his belongings. Selfishness has its genesis in the many instances in\\nwhich pleasure results from ministering to self. In all these cases it\\nis seen that our sentiments develop out of our experiences: they are the\\npermanent but ever-growing results which we have to show for experiences\\nwhich are somewhat long continued, and in which a certain feeling\\nquality is a strong accompaniment of the cognitive part of the\\nexperience.\\n\\nTHE INFLUENCE OF SENTIMENT.--Our sentiments, like our dispositions, are\\nnot only a natural growth from the experiences upon which they are fed,\\nbut they in turn have large influence in determining the direction of\\nour further development. Our sentiments furnish the soil which is either\\nfavorable or hostile to the growth of new experiences. One in whom the\\nsentiment of true patriotism is deep-rooted will find it much harder to\\nrespond to a suggestion to betray his country\\'s honor on battlefield, in\\nlegislative hall, or in private life, than one lacking in this\\nsentiment. The boy who has a strong sentiment of love for his mother\\nwill find this a restraining influence in the face of temptation to\\ncommit deeds which would wound her feelings. A deep and abiding faith in\\nGod is fatal to the growth of pessimism, distrust, and a self-centered\\nlife. One\\'s sentiments are a safe gauge of his character. Let us know a\\nman\\'s attitude or sentiments on religion, morality, friendship, honesty,\\nand the other great questions of life, and little remains to be known.\\nIf he is right on these, he may well be trusted in other things; if he\\nis wrong on these, there is little to build upon.\\n\\nLiterature has drawn its best inspiration and choicest themes from the\\nfield of our sentiments. The sentiment of friendship has given us our\\nDavid and Jonathan, our Damon and Pythias, and our Tennyson and Hallam.\\nThe sentiment of love has inspired countless masterpieces; without its\\naid most of our fiction would lose its plot, and most of our poetry its\\ncharm. Religious sentiment inspired Milton to write the world\\'s greatest\\nepic, \"Paradise Lost.\" The sentiment of patriotism has furnished an\\ninexhaustible theme for the writer and the orator. Likewise if we go\\ninto the field of music and art, we find that the best efforts of the\\nmasters are clustered around some human sentiment which has appealed to\\nthem, and which they have immortalized by expressing it on canvas or in\\nmarble, that it may appeal to others and cause the sentiment to grow in\\nus.\\n\\nSENTIMENTS AS MOTIVES.--The sentiments furnish the deepest, the most\\nconstant, and the most powerful motives which control our lives. Such\\nsentiments as patriotism, liberty, and religion have called a thousand\\narmies to struggle and die on ten thousand battlefields, and have given\\nmartyrs courage to suffer in the fires of persecution. Sentiments of\\nfriendship and love have prompted countless deeds of self-sacrifice and\\nloving devotion. Sentiments of envy, pride, and jealousy have changed\\nthe boundary lines of nations, and have prompted the committing of ten\\nthousand unnamable crimes. Slowly day by day from the cradle to the\\ngrave we are weaving into our lives the threads of sentiment, which at\\nlast become so many cables to bind us to good or evil.\\n\\n\\n4. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Are you subject to the \"blues,\" or other forms of depressed feeling?\\nAre your moods very changeable, or rather constant? What kind of a\\ndisposition do you think you have? How did you come by it; that is, in\\nhow far is it due to hereditary temperament, and in how far to your\\ndaily moods?\\n\\n2. Can you recall an instance in which some undesirable mood was caused\\nby your physical condition? By some disturbing mental condition? What is\\nyour characteristic mood in the morning after sleeping in an\\nill-ventilated room? After sitting for half a day in an ill-ventilated\\nschoolroom? After eating indigestible food before going to bed?\\n\\n3. Observe a number of children or your classmates closely and see\\nwhether you can determine the characteristic mood of each. Observe\\nseveral different schools and see whether you can note a characteristic\\nmood for each room. Try to determine the causes producing the\\ndifferences noted. (Physical conditions in the room, personality of the\\nteacher, methods of governing, teaching, etc.)\\n\\n4. When can you do your best work, when you are happy, or unhappy?\\nCheerful, or \"blue\"? Confident and hopeful, or discouraged? In a spirit\\nof harmony and coöperation with your teacher, or antagonistic? Now\\nrelate your conclusions to the type of atmosphere that should prevail in\\nthe schoolroom or the home. Formulate a statement as to why the \"spirit\"\\nof the school is all-important. (Effect on effort, growth, disposition,\\nsentiments, character, etc.)\\n\\n5. Can you measure more or less accurately the extent to which your\\nfeelings serve as _motives_ in your life? Are feelings alone a safe\\nguide to action? Make a list of the important sentiments that should be\\ncultivated in youth. Now show how the work of the school may be used to\\nstrengthen worthy sentiments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nTHE EMOTIONS\\n\\n\\nFeeling and emotion are not to be looked upon as two different _kinds_\\nof mental processes. In fact, emotion is but _a feeling state of a high\\ndegree of intensity and complexity_. Emotion transcends the simpler\\nfeeling states whenever the exciting cause is sufficient to throw us out\\nof our regular routine of affective experience. The distinction between\\nemotion and feeling is a purely arbitrary one, since the difference is\\nonly one of complexity and degree, and many feelings may rise to the\\nintensity of emotions. A feeling of sadness on hearing of a number of\\nfatalities in a railway accident may suddenly become an emotion of grief\\nif we learn that a member of our family is among those killed. A feeling\\nof gladness may develop into an emotion of joy, or a feeling of\\nresentment be kindled into an emotion of rage.\\n\\n\\n1. THE PRODUCING AND EXPRESSING OF EMOTION\\n\\nNowhere more than in connection with our emotions are the close\\ninter-relations of mind and body seen. All are familiar with the fact\\nthat the emotion of anger tends to find expression in the blow, love in\\nthe caress, fear in flight, and so on. But just how our organism acts in\\n_producing_ an emotion is less generally understood. Professor James and\\nProfessor Lange have shown us that emotion not only tends to produce\\nsome characteristic form of response, but that _the emotion is itself\\ncaused by certain deep-seated physiological reactions_. Let us seek to\\nunderstand this statement a little more fully.\\n\\nPHYSIOLOGICAL EXPLANATION OF EMOTION.--We must remember first of all\\nthat _all_ changes in mental states are accompanied by corresponding\\nphysiological changes. Hard, concentrated thinking quickens the heart\\nbeat; keen attention is accompanied by muscular tension; certain sights\\nor sounds increase the rate of breathing; offensive odors produce\\nnausea, and so on. So complete and perfect is the response of our\\nphysical organism to mental changes that one psychologist declares it\\npossible, had we sufficiently delicate apparatus, to measure the\\nreactions caused throughout the body of a sleeping child by the shadow\\nfrom a passing cloud falling upon the closed eyelids.\\n\\nThe order of the entire event resulting in an emotion is as follows: (1)\\nSomething is _known_; some object enters consciousness coming either\\nfrom immediate perception or through memory or imagination. This fact,\\nor thing known, must be of such nature that it will, (2) set up\\ndeep-seated and characteristic _organic response_; (3) the feeling\\n_accompanying and caused by these physiological reactions constitutes\\nthe emotion_. For example, we may be passing along the street in a\\nperfectly calm and equable state of mind, when we come upon a teamster\\nwho is brutally beating an exhausted horse because it is unable to draw\\nan overloaded wagon up a slippery incline. The facts grasped as we take\\nin the situation constitute the _first_ element in an emotional response\\ndeveloping in our consciousness. But instantly our muscles begin to grow\\ntense, the heart beat and breath quicken, the face takes on a different\\nexpression, the hands clench--the entire organism is reacting to the\\ndisturbing situation; the _second_ factor in the rising emotion, the\\nphysiological response, thus appears. Along with our apprehension of the\\ncruelty and the organic disturbances which result we feel waves of\\nindignation and anger surging through us. This is the _third_ factor in\\nthe emotional event, or the emotion itself. In some such way as this are\\nall of our emotions aroused.\\n\\nORIGIN OF CHARACTERISTIC EMOTIONAL REACTIONS.--Why do certain facts or\\nobjects of consciousness always cause certain characteristic organic\\nresponses?\\n\\nIn order to solve this problem we shall have first to go beyond the\\nindividual and appeal to the history of the race. What the race has\\nfound serviceable, the individual repeats. But even then it is hard to\\nsee why the particular type of physical response such as shrinking,\\npallor, and trembling, which naturally follow stimuli threatening harm,\\nshould be the best. It is easy to see, however, that the feeling which\\nprompts to flight or serves to deter from harm\\'s way might be useful. It\\nis plain that there is an advantage in the tense muscle, the set teeth,\\nthe held breath, and the quickened pulse which accompany the emotion of\\nanger, and also in the feeling of anger itself, which prompts to the\\nconflict. But even if we are not able in every case to determine at this\\nday why all the instinctive responses and their correlate of feeling\\nwere the best for the life of the race, we may be sure that such was the\\ncase; for Nature is inexorable in her dictates that only that shall\\npersist which has proved serviceable in the largest number of cases.\\n\\nAn interesting question arises at this point as to why we feel emotion\\naccompanying some of our motor responses, and not others. Perceptions\\nare crowding in upon us hour after hour; memory, thought, and\\nimagination are in constant play; and a continuous motor discharge\\nresults each moment in physical expressions great or small. Yet, in\\nspite of these facts, feeling which is strong enough to rise to an\\nemotion is only an occasional thing. If emotion accompanies any form of\\nphysical expression, why not all? Let us see whether we can discover any\\nreason. One day I saw a boy leading a dog along the street. All at once\\nthe dog slipped the string over its head and ran away. The boy stood\\nlooking after the dog for a moment, and then burst into a fit of rage.\\nWhat all had happened? The moment before the dog broke away everything\\nwas running smoothly in the experience of the boy. There was no\\nobstruction to his thought or his plans. Then in an instant the\\nsituation changes. The smooth flow of experience is checked and baffled.\\nThe discharge of nerve currents which meant thought, plans, action, is\\nblocked. A crisis has arisen which requires readjustment. The nerve\\ncurrents must flow in new directions, giving new thought, new plans, new\\nactivities--the dog must be recaptured. It is in connection with this\\ndamming up of nerve currents from following their wonted channels that\\nthe emotion emerges. Or, putting it into mental terms, the emotion\\noccurs when the ordinary current of our thought is violently\\ndisturbed--when we meet with some crisis which necessitates a\\nreadjustment of our thought relations and plans, either temporarily or\\npermanently.\\n\\nTHE DURATION OF AN EMOTION.--If the required readjustment is but\\ntemporary, then the emotion is short-lived, while if the readjustment is\\nnecessarily of longer duration, the emotion also will live longer. The\\nfear which follows the thunder is relatively brief; for the shock is\\ngone in a moment, and our thought is but temporarily disturbed. If the\\nimpending danger is one that persists, however, as of some secret\\nassassin threatening our life, the fear also will persist. The grief of\\na child over the loss of someone dear to him is comparatively short,\\nbecause the current of the child\\'s life has not been so closely bound up\\nin a complexity of experiences with the lost object as in the case of an\\nolder person, and hence the readjustment is easier. The grief of an\\nadult over the loss of a very dear friend lasts long, for the object\\ngrieved over has so become a part of the bereaved one\\'s experience that\\nthe loss requires a very complete readjustment of the whole life. In\\neither case, however, as this readjustment is accomplished the emotion\\ngradually fades away.\\n\\nEMOTIONS ACCOMPANYING CRISES IN EXPERIENCE.--If our description of the\\nfeelings has been correct, it will be seen that the simpler and milder\\nfeelings are for the common run of our everyday experience; they are the\\ncommon valuers of our thought and acts from hour to hour. The emotions,\\nor more intense feeling states, are, however, the occasional high tide\\nof feeling which occurs in crises or emergencies. We are angry on some\\nparticular provocation, we fear some extraordinary factor in our\\nenvironment, we are joyful over some unusual good fortune.\\n\\n\\n2. THE CONTROL OF EMOTIONS\\n\\nDEPENDENCE ON EXPRESSION.--Since all emotions rest upon some form of\\nphysical or physiological expression primarily, and upon some thought\\nback of this secondarily, it follows that the first step in controlling\\nan emotion is to secure _the removal of the state of consciousness_\\nwhich serves as its basis. This may be done, for instance, with a child,\\neither by banishing the terrifying dog from his presence, or by\\nconvincing him that the dog is harmless. The motor response will then\\ncease, and the emotion pass away. If the thought is persistent, however,\\nthrough the continuance of its stimulus, then what remains is to seek to\\ncontrol the physical expression, and in that way suppress the emotion.\\nIf, instead of the knit brow, the tense muscles, the quickened heart\\nbeat, and all the deeper organic changes which go along with these, we\\ncan keep a smile on the face, the muscles relaxed, the heart beat\\nsteady, and a normal condition in all the other organs, we shall have no\\ncause to fear an explosion of anger. If we are afraid of mice and feel\\nan almost irresistible tendency to mount a chair every time we see a\\nmouse, we can do wonders in suppressing the fear by resolutely refusing\\nto give expression to these tendencies. Inhibition of the expression\\ninevitably means the death of the emotion.\\n\\nThis fact has its bad side as well as its good in the feeling life, for\\nit means that good emotions as well as bad will fade out if we fail to\\nallow them expression. We are all perfectly familiar with the fact in\\nour own experience that an interest which does not find means of\\nexpression soon passes away. Sympathy unexpressed ere long passes over\\ninto indifference. Even love cannot live without expression. Religious\\nemotion which does not go out in deeds of service cannot persist. The\\nnatural end and aim of our emotions is to serve as motives to activity;\\nand missing this opportunity, they have not only failed in their office,\\nbut will themselves die of inaction.\\n\\nRELIEF THROUGH EXPRESSION.--Emotional states not only have their rise\\nin organic reactions, but they also tend to result in acts. When we are\\nangry, or in love, or in fear, we have the impulse _to do something\\nabout it_. And, while it is true that emotion may be inhibited by\\nsuppressing the physical expressions on which it is founded, so may a\\nstate of emotional tension be relieved by some forms of expression. None\\nhave failed to experience the relief which comes to the overcharged\\nnervous system from a good cry. There is no sorrow so bitter as a dry\\nsorrow, when one cannot weep. A state of anger or annoyance is relieved\\nby an explosion of some kind, whether in a blow or its equivalent in\\nspeech. We often feel better when we have told a man \"what we think of\\nhim.\"\\n\\nAt first glance this all seems opposed to what we have been laying down\\nas the explanation of emotion. Yet it is not so if we look well into the\\ncase. We have already seen that emotion occurs when there is a blocking\\nof the usual pathways of discharge for the nerve currents, which must\\nthen seek new outlets, and thus result in the setting up of new motor\\nresponses. In the case of grief, for example, there is a disturbance in\\nthe whole organism; the heart beat is deranged, the blood pressure\\ndiminished, and the nerve tone lowered. What is needed is for the\\ncurrents which are finding an outlet in directions resulting in these\\nparticular responses to find a pathway of discharge which will not\\nproduce such deep-seated results. This may be found in crying. The\\nenergy thus expended is diverted from producing internal disturbances.\\nLikewise, the explosion in anger may serve to restore the equilibrium of\\ndisturbed nerve currents.\\n\\nRELIEF DOES NOT FOLLOW IF IMAGE IS HELD BEFORE THE MIND.--All this is\\ntrue, however, only when the expression does not serve to keep the idea\\nbefore the mind which was originally responsible for the emotion. A\\nperson may work himself into a passion of anger by beginning to talk\\nabout an insult and, as he grows increasingly violent, bringing the\\nsituation more and more sharply into his consciousness. The effect of\\nterrifying images is easily to be observed in the case of one\\'s starting\\nto run when he is afraid after night. There is probably no doubt that\\nthe running would relieve his fear providing he could do it and not\\npicture the threatening something as pursuing him. But, with his\\nimagination conjuring up dire images of frightful catastrophes at every\\nstep, all control is lost and fresh waves of terror surge over the\\nshrinking soul.\\n\\nGROWING TENDENCY TOWARD EMOTIONAL CONTROL.--Among civilized peoples\\nthere is a constantly growing tendency toward emotional control.\\nPrimitive races express grief, joy, fear, or anger much more freely than\\ndo civilized races. This does not mean that primitive man feels more\\ndeeply than civilized man; for, as we have already seen, the crying,\\nlaughing, or blustering is but a small part of the whole physical\\nexpression, and one\\'s entire organism may be stirred to its depths\\nwithout any of these outward manifestations. Man has found it advisable\\nas he has advanced in civilization not to reveal all he feels to those\\naround him. The face, which is the most expressive part of the body, has\\ncome to be under such perfect control that it is hard to read through it\\nthe emotional state, although the face of civilized man is capable of\\nexpressing far more than is that of the savage. The same difference is\\nobservable between the child and the adult. The child reveals each\\npassing shade of emotion through his expression, while the adult may\\nfeel much that he does not show.\\n\\n\\n3. CULTIVATION OF THE EMOTIONS\\n\\nThere is no other mental factor which has more to do with the enjoyment\\nwe get out of life than our feelings and emotions.\\n\\nTHE EMOTIONS AND ENJOYMENT.--Few of us would care to live at all, if all\\nfeeling were eliminated from human experience. True, feeling often makes\\nus suffer; but in so far as life\\'s joys triumph over its woes, do our\\nfeelings minister to our enjoyment. Without sympathy, love, and\\nappreciation, life would be barren indeed. Moreover, it is only through\\nour own emotional experience that we are able to interpret the feeling\\nside of the lives about us. Failing in this, we miss one of the most\\nsignificant phases of social experience, and are left with our own\\nsympathies undeveloped and our life by so much impoverished.\\n\\nThe interpretation of the subtler emotions of those about us is in no\\nsmall degree an art. The human face and form present a constantly\\nchanging panorama of the soul\\'s feeling states to those who can read\\ntheir signs. The ability to read the finer feelings, which reveal\\nthemselves in expression too delicate to be read by the eye of the gross\\nor unsympathetic observer, lies at the basis of all fine interpretation\\nof personality. Feelings are often too deep for outward expression, and\\nwe are slow to reveal our deepest selves to those who cannot appreciate\\nand understand them.\\n\\nHOW EMOTIONS DEVELOP.--Emotions are to be cultivated as the intellect or\\nthe muscles are to be cultivated; namely, through proper exercise. Our\\nthought is to dwell on those things to which proper emotions attach, and\\nto shun lines which would suggest emotions of an undesirable type.\\nEmotions which are to be developed must, as has already been said, find\\nexpression; we must act in response to their leadings, else they become\\nbut idle vaporings. If love prompts us to say a kind word to a suffering\\nfellow mortal, the word must be spoken or the feeling itself fades away.\\nOn the other hand, the emotions which we wish to suppress are to be\\nrefused expression. The unkind and cutting word is to be left unsaid\\nwhen we are angry, and the fear of things which are harmless left\\nunexpressed and thereby doomed to die.\\n\\nTHE EMOTIONAL FACTOR IN OUR ENVIRONMENT.--Much material for the\\ncultivation of our emotions lies in the everyday life all about us if we\\ncan but interpret it. Few indeed of those whom we meet daily but are\\nhungering for appreciation and sympathy. Lovable traits exist in every\\ncharacter, and will reveal themselves to the one who looks for them.\\nMiscarriages of justice abound on all sides, and demand our indignation\\nand wrath and the effort to right the wrong. Evil always exists to be\\nhated and suppressed, and dangers to be feared and avoided. Human life\\nand the movement of human affairs constantly appeal to the feeling side\\nof our nature if we understand at all what life and action mean.\\n\\nA certain blindness exists in many people, however, which makes our own\\nlittle joys, or sorrows, or fears the most remarkable ones in the world,\\nand keeps us from realizing that others may feel as deeply as we. Of\\ncourse this self-centered attitude of mind is fatal to any true\\ncultivation of the emotions. It leads to an emotional life which lacks\\nnot only breadth and depth, but also perspective.\\n\\nLITERATURE AND THE CULTIVATION OF THE EMOTIONS.--In order to increase\\nour facility in the interpretation of the emotions through teaching us\\nwhat to look for in life and experience, we may go to literature. Here\\nwe find life interpreted for us in the ideal by masters of\\ninterpretation; and, looking through their eyes, we see new depths and\\nbreadths of feeling which we had never before discovered. Indeed,\\nliterature deals far more in the aggregate with the feeling side than\\nwith any other aspect of human life. And it is just this which makes\\nliterature a universal language, for the language of our emotions is\\nmore easily interpreted than that of our reason. The smile, the cry, the\\nlaugh, the frown, the caress, are understood all around the world among\\nall peoples. They are universal.\\n\\nThere is always this danger to be avoided, however. We may become so\\ntaken up with the overwrought descriptions of the emotions as found in\\nliterature or on the stage that the common humdrum of everyday life\\naround us seems flat and stale. The interpretation of the writer or the\\nactor is far beyond what we are able to make for ourselves, so we take\\ntheir interpretation rather than trouble ourselves to look in our own\\nenvironment for the material which might appeal to our emotions. It is\\nnot rare to find those who easily weep over the woes of an imaginary\\nperson in a book or on the stage unable to feel sympathy for the real\\nsuffering which exists all around them. The story is told of a lady at\\nthe theater who wept over the suffering of the hero in the play; and at\\nthe moment she was shedding the unnecessary tears, her own coachman,\\nwhom she had compelled to wait for her in the street, was frozen to\\ndeath. Our seemingly prosaic environment is full of suggestions to the\\nemotional life, and books and plays should only help to develop in us\\nthe power rightly to respond to these suggestions.\\n\\nHARM IN EMOTIONAL OVEREXCITEMENT.--Danger may exist also in still\\nanother line; namely, that of emotional overexcitement. There is a great\\nnervous strain in high emotional tension. Nothing is more exhausting\\nthan a severe fit of anger; it leaves its victim weak and limp. A severe\\ncase of fright often incapacitates one for mental or physical labor for\\nhours, or it may even result in permanent injury. The whole nervous tone\\nis distinctly lowered by sorrow, and even excessive joy may be harmful.\\n\\nIn our actual, everyday life, there is little danger from emotional\\noverexcitement unless it be in the case of fear in children, as was\\nshown in the discussion on instincts, and in that of grief over the loss\\nof objects that are dear to us. Most of our childish fears we could just\\nas well avoid if our elders were wiser in the matter of guarding us\\nagainst those that are unnecessary. The griefs we cannot hope to escape,\\nalthough we can do much to control them. Long-continued emotional\\nexcitement, unless it is followed by corresponding activity, gives us\\nthose who weep over the wrongs of humanity, but never do anything to\\nright them; who are sorry to the point of death over human suffering,\\nbut cannot be induced to lend their aid to its alleviation. We could\\nvery well spare a thousand of those in the world who merely feel, for\\none who acts, James tells us.\\n\\nWe should watch, then, that our good feelings do not simply evaporate as\\nfeelings, but that they find some place to apply themselves to\\naccomplish good; that we do not, like Hamlet, rave over wrongs which\\nneed to be righted, but never bring ourselves to the point where we take\\na hand in their righting. If our emotional life is to be rich and deep\\nin its feeling and effective in its results on our acts and character,\\nit must find its outlet in deeds.\\n\\n\\n4. EMOTIONS AS MOTIVES\\n\\nEmotion is always dynamic, and our feelings constitute our strongest\\nmotives to action and achievement.\\n\\nHOW OUR EMOTIONS COMPEL US.--Love has often done in the reformation of a\\nfallen life what strength of will was not able to accomplish; it has\\ncaused dynasties to fall, and has changed the map of nations. Hatred is\\na motive hardly less strong. Fear will make savage beasts out of men who\\nfall under its sway, causing them to trample helpless women and children\\nunder feet, whom in their saner moments they would protect with their\\nlives. Anger puts out all the light of reason, and prompts peaceful and\\nwell-meaning men to commit murderous acts.\\n\\nThus feeling, from the faintest and simplest feeling of interest, the\\nvarious ranges of pleasures and pain, the sentiments which underlie all\\nour lives, and so on to the mighty emotions which grip our lives with an\\noverpowering strength, constitutes a large part of the motive power\\nwhich is constantly urging us on to do and dare. Hence it is important\\nfrom this standpoint, also, that we should have the right type of\\nfeelings and emotions well developed, and the undesirable ones\\neliminated.\\n\\nEMOTIONAL HABITS.--Emotion and feeling are partly matters of habit. That\\nis, we can form emotional as well as other habits, and they are as hard\\nto break. Anger allowed to run uncontrolled leads into habits of angry\\noutbursts, while the one who habitually controls his temper finds it\\nsubmitting to the habit of remaining within bounds. One may cultivate\\nthe habit of showing his fear on all occasions, or of discouraging its\\nexpression. He may form the habit of jealousy or of confidence. It is\\npossible even to form the habit of falling in love, or of so\\nsuppressing the tender emotions that love finds little opportunity for\\nexpression.\\n\\nAnd here, as elsewhere, habits are formed through performing the acts\\nupon which the habit rests. If there are emotional habits we are\\ndesirous of forming, what we have to do is to indulge the emotional\\nexpression of the type we desire, and the habit will follow. If we wish\\nto form the habit of living in a chronic state of the blues, then all we\\nhave to do is to be blue and act blue sufficiently, and this form of\\nemotional expression will become a part of us. If we desire to form the\\nhabit of living in a happy, cheerful state, we can accomplish this by\\nencouraging the corresponding expression.\\n\\n\\n5. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. What are the characteristic bodily expressions by which you can\\nrecognize a state of anger? Fear? Jealousy? Hatred? Love? Grief? Do you\\nknow persons who are inclined to be too expressive emotionally? Who show\\ntoo little emotional expression? How would you classify yourself in this\\nrespect?\\n\\n2. Are you naturally responsive to the emotional tone of others; that\\nis, are you sympathetic? Are you easily affected by reading emotional\\nbooks? By emotional plays or other appeals? What is the danger from\\noverexciting the emotions without giving them a proper outlet in some\\npractical activity?\\n\\n3. Have you observed a tendency among adults not to take seriously the\\nemotions of a child; for example, to look upon childish grief as\\ntrivial, or fear as something to be laughed at? Is the child\\'s emotional\\nlife as real as that of the adult? (See Ch. IX, Betts, \"Fathers and\\nMothers.\")\\n\\n4. Have you known children to repress their emotions for fear of being\\nlaughed at? Have you known parents or others to remark about childish\\nlove affairs to the children themselves in a light or joking way? Ought\\nthis ever to be done?\\n\\n5. Note certain children who give way to fits of anger; what is the\\nremedy? Note other children who cry readily; what would you suggest as a\\ncure? (Why should ridicule not be used?)\\n\\n6. Have you observed any teacher using the lesson in literature or\\nhistory to cultivate the finer emotions? What emotions have you seen\\nappealed to by a lesson in nature study? What emotions have you observed\\non the playground that needed restraint? Do you think that on the whole\\nthe emotional life of the child receives enough consideration in the\\nschool? In the home?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nINTEREST\\n\\n\\nThe feeling that we call interest is so important a motive in our lives\\nand so colors our acts and gives direction to our endeavors that we will\\ndo well to devote a chapter to its discussion.\\n\\n\\n1. THE NATURE OF INTEREST\\n\\nWe saw in an earlier chapter that personal habits have their rise in\\nrace habits or instincts. Let us now see how interest helps the\\nindividual to select from his instinctive acts those which are useful to\\nbuild into personal habits. Instinct impartially starts the child in the\\nperformance of many different activities, but does not dictate what\\nparticular acts shall be retained to serve as the basis for habits.\\nInterest comes in at this point and says, \"This act is of more value\\nthan that act; continue this act and drop that.\" Instinct prompts the\\nbabe to countless movements of body and limb. Interest picks out those\\nthat are most vitally connected with the welfare of the organism, and\\nthe child comes to prefer these rather than the others. Thus it is that\\nout of the random movements of arms and legs and head and body we\\nfinally develop the coördinated activities which are infinitely more\\nuseful than the random ones were. And these activities, originating in\\ninstincts, and selected by interest, are soon crystallized into habits.\\n\\nINTEREST A SELECTIVE AGENT.--The same truth holds for mental activities\\nas for physical. A thousand channels lie open for your stream of thought\\nat this moment, but your interest has beckoned it into the one\\nparticular channel which, for the time, at least, appears to be of the\\ngreatest subjective value; and it is now following that channel unless\\nyour will has compelled it to leave that for another. Your thinking as\\nnaturally follows your interest as the needle does the magnet, hence\\nyour thought activities are conditioned largely by your interests. This\\nis equivalent to saying that your mental habits rest back finally upon\\nyour interests.\\n\\nEveryone knows what it is to be interested; but interest, like other\\nelementary states of consciousness, cannot be rigidly defined. (1)\\nSubjectively considered, interest may be looked upon as _a feeling\\nattitude which assigns our activities their place in a subjective scale\\nof values_, and hence selects among them. (2) Objectively considered, an\\ninterest is _the object which calls forth the feeling_. (3) Functionally\\nconsidered, interest is _the dynamic phase of consciousness_.\\n\\nINTEREST SUPPLIES A SUBJECTIVE SCALE OF VALUES.--If you are interested\\nin driving a horse rather than in riding a bicycle, it is because the\\nformer has a greater subjective value to you than the latter. If you are\\ninterested in reading these words instead of thinking about the next\\nsocial function or the last picnic party, it is because at this moment\\nthe thought suggested appeals to you as of more value than the other\\nlines of thought. From this it follows that your standards of values are\\nrevealed in the character of your interests. The young man who is\\ninterested in the race track, in gaming, and in low resorts confesses by\\nthe fact that these things occupy a high place among the things which\\nappeal to him as subjectively valuable. The mother whose interests are\\nchiefly in clubs and other social organizations places these higher in\\nher scale of values than her home. The reader who can become interested\\nonly in light, trashy literature must admit that matter of this type\\nranks higher in his subjective scale of values than the works of the\\nmasters. Teachers and students whose strongest interest is in grade\\nmarks value these more highly than true attainment. For, whatever may be\\nour claims or assertions, interest is finally an infallible barometer of\\nthe values we assign to our activities.\\n\\nIn the case of some of our feelings it is not always possible to ascribe\\nan objective side to them. A feeling of ennui, of impending evil, or of\\nbounding vivacity, may be produced by an unanalyzable complex of causes.\\nBut interest, while it is related primarily to the activities of the\\nself, is carried over from the activity to the object which occasions\\nthe activity. That is, interest has both an objective and a subjective\\nside. On the subjective side a certain activity connected with\\nself-expression is worth so much; on the objective side a certain object\\nis worth so much as related to this self-expression. Thus we say, I have\\nan interest in books or in business; my daily activities, my\\nself-expression, are governed with reference to these objects. They are\\nmy interests.\\n\\nINTEREST DYNAMIC.--Many of our milder feelings terminate within\\nourselves, never attaining sufficient force as motives to impel us to\\naction. Not so with interest. Its very nature is dynamic. Whatever it\\nseizes upon becomes _ipso facto_ an object for some activity, for some\\nform of expression of the self. Are we interested in a new book, we must\\nread it; in a new invention, we must see it, handle it, test it; in some\\nvocation or avocation, we must pursue it. Interest is impulsive. It\\ngives its possessor no opportunity for lethargic rest and quiet, but\\nconstantly urges him to action. Grown ardent, interest becomes\\nenthusiasm, \"without which,\" says Emerson, \"nothing great was ever\\naccomplished.\" Are we an Edison, with a strong interest centered in\\nmechanical invention, it will drive us day and night in a ceaseless\\nactivity which scarcely gives us time for food and sleep. Are we a\\nLincoln, with an undying interest in the Union, this motive will make\\npossible superhuman efforts for the accomplishment of our end. Are we\\nman or woman anywhere, in any walk of life, so we are dominated by\\nmighty interests grown into enthusiasm for some object, we shall find\\ngreat purposes growing within us, and our life will be one of activity\\nand achievement. On the contrary, a life which has developed no great\\ninterest lacks motive power. Of necessity such a life must be devoid of\\npurpose and hence barren of results, counting little while it is being\\nlived, and little missed by the world when it is gone.\\n\\nHABIT ANTAGONISTIC TO INTEREST.--While, as we have seen, interest is\\nnecessary to the formation of habits, yet habits once formed are\\nantagonistic to interest. That is, acts which are so habitually\\nperformed that they \"do themselves\" are accompanied by a minimum of\\ninterest. They come to be done without attentive consciousness, hence\\ninterest cannot attach to their performance. Many of the activities\\nwhich make up the daily round of our lives are of this kind. As long as\\nhabit is being modified in some degree, as long as we are improving in\\nour ways of doing things, interest will still cling to the process; but\\nlet us once settle into an unmodified rut, and interest quickly fades\\naway. We then have the conditions present which make of us either a\\nmachine or a drudge.\\n\\n\\n2. DIRECT AND INDIRECT INTEREST\\n\\nWe may have an interest either (1) in the doing of an act, or (2) in the\\nend sought through the doing. In the first instance we call the interest\\n_immediate_ or _direct_; in the second instance, _mediate_ or\\n_indirect_.\\n\\nINTEREST IN THE END VERSUS INTEREST IN THE ACTIVITY.--If we do not find\\nan interest in the doing of our work, or if it has become positively\\ndisagreeable so that we loathe its performance, then there must be some\\nultimate end for which the task is being performed, and in which there\\nis a strong interest, else the whole process will be the veriest\\ndrudgery. If the end is sufficiently interesting it may serve to throw a\\nhalo of interest over the whole process connected with it. The following\\ninstance illustrates this fact:\\n\\nA twelve-year-old boy was told by his father that if he would make the\\nbody of an automobile at his bench in the manual training school, the\\nfather would purchase the running gear for it and give the machine to\\nthe boy. In order to secure the coveted prize, the boy had to master the\\narithmetic necessary for making the calculations, and the drawing\\nnecessary for making the plans to scale before the teacher in manual\\ntraining would allow him to take up the work of construction. The boy\\nhad always lacked interest in both arithmetic and drawing, and\\nconsequently was dull in them. Under the new incentive, however, he took\\nhold of them with such avidity that he soon surpassed all the remainder\\nof the class, and was able to make his calculations and drawings within\\na term. He secured his automobile a few months later, and still retained\\nhis interest in arithmetic and drawing.\\n\\nINDIRECT INTEREST AS A MOTIVE.--Interest of the indirect type, which\\ndoes not attach to the process, but comes from some more or less\\ndistant end, most of us find much less potent than interest which is\\nimmediate. This is especially true unless the end be one of intense\\ndesire and not too distant. The assurance to a boy that he must get his\\nlessons well because he will need to be an educated man ten years hence\\nwhen he goes into business for himself does not compensate for the lack\\nof interest in the lessons of today.\\n\\nYet it is necessary in the economy of life that both children and adults\\nshould learn to work under the incitement of indirect interests. Much of\\nthe work we do is for an end which is more desirable than the work\\nitself. It will always be necessary to sacrifice present pleasure for\\nfuture good. Ability to work cheerfully for a somewhat distant end saves\\nmuch of our work from becoming drudgery. If interest is removed from\\nboth the process and the end, no inducement is left to work except\\ncompulsion; and this, if continued, results in the lowest type of\\neffort. It puts a man on a level with the beast of burden, which\\nconstantly shirks its work.\\n\\nINDIRECT INTEREST ALONE INSUFFICIENT.--Interest coming from an end\\ninstead of inhering in the process may finally lead to an interest in\\nthe work itself; but if it does not, the worker is in danger of being\\nleft a drudge at last. To be more than a slave to his work one must\\nultimately find the work worth doing for its own sake. The man who\\nperforms his work solely because he has a wife and babies at home will\\nnever be an artist in his trade or profession; the student who masters a\\nsubject only because he must know it for an examination is not\\ndeveloping the traits of a scholar. The question of interest in the\\nprocess makes the difference between the one who works because he loves\\nto work and the one who toils because he must--it makes the difference\\nbetween the artist and the drudge. The drudge does only what he must\\nwhen he works, the artist all he can. The drudge longs for the end of\\nlabor, the artist for it to begin. The drudge studies how he may escape\\nhis labor, the artist how he may better his and ennoble it.\\n\\nTo labor when there is joy in the work is elevating, to labor under the\\nlash of compulsion is degrading. It matters not so much what a man\\'s\\noccupation as how it is performed. A coachman driving his team down the\\ncrowded street better than anyone else could do it, and glorying in that\\nfact, may be a true artist in his occupation, and be ennobled through\\nhis work. A statesman molding the affairs of a nation as no one else\\ncould do it, or a scholar leading the thought of his generation is\\nsubject to the same law; in order to give the best grade of service of\\nwhich he is capable, man must find a joy in the performance of the work\\nas well as in the end sought through its performance. No matter how high\\nthe position or how refined the work, the worker becomes a slave to his\\nlabor unless interest in its performance saves him.\\n\\n\\n3. TRANSITORINESS OF CERTAIN INTERESTS\\n\\nSince our interests are always connected with our activities it follows\\nthat many interests will have their birth, grow to full strength, and\\nthen fade away as the corresponding instincts which are responsible for\\nthe activities pass through these same stages. This only means that\\ninterest in play develops at the time when the play activities are\\nseeking expression; that interest in the opposite sex becomes strong\\nwhen instinctive tendencies are directing the attention to the choice of\\na mate; and that interest in abstract studies comes when the\\ndevelopment of the brain enables us to carry on logical trains of\\nthought. All of us can recall many interests which were once strong, and\\nare now weak or else have altogether passed away. Hide-and-seek,\\nPussy-wants-a-corner, excursions to the little fishing pond, securing\\nthe colored chromo at school, the care of pets, reading\\nblood-and-thunder stories or sentimental ones--interest in these things\\nbelongs to our past, or has left but a faint shadow. Other interests\\nhave come, and these in turn will also disappear and other new ones yet\\nappear as long as we keep on acquiring new experience.\\n\\nINTERESTS MUST BE UTILIZED WHEN THEY APPEAR.--This means that we must\\ntake advantage of interests when they appear if we wish to utilize and\\ndevelop them. How many people there are who at one time felt an interest\\nimpelling them to cultivate their taste for music, art, or literature\\nand said they would do this at some convenient season, and finally found\\nthemselves without a taste for these things! How many of us have felt an\\ninterest in some benevolent work, but at last discovered that our\\ninclination had died before we found time to help the cause! How many of\\nus, young as we are, do not at this moment lament the passing of some\\ninterest from our lives, or are now watching the dying of some interest\\nwhich we had fondly supposed was as stable as Gibraltar? The drawings of\\nevery interest which appeals to us is a voice crying, \"Now is the\\nappointed time!\" What impulse urges us today to become or to do, we must\\nbegin at once to be or perform, if we would attain to the coveted end.\\n\\nTHE VALUE OF A STRONG INTEREST.--Nor are we to look upon these\\ntransitory interests as useless. They come to us not only as a race\\nheritage, but they impel us to activities which are immediately useful,\\nor else prepare us for the later battles of life. But even aside from\\nthis important fact it is worth everything just to be interested. For it\\nis only through the impulsion of interest that we first learn to put\\nforth effort in any true sense of the word, and interest furnishes the\\nfinal foundation upon which volition rests. Without interest the\\ngreatest powers may slumber in us unawakened, and abilities capable of\\nthe highest attainment rest satisfied with commonplace mediocrity. No\\none will ever know how many Gladstones and Leibnitzes the world has lost\\nsimply because their interests were never appealed to in such a way as\\nto start them on the road to achievement. It matters less what the\\ninterest be, so it be not bad, than that there shall be some great\\ninterest to compel endeavor, test the strength of endurance, and lead to\\nhabits of achievement.\\n\\n\\n4. SELECTION AMONG OUR INTERESTS\\n\\nI said early in the discussion that interest is selective among our\\nactivities, picking out those which appear to be of the most value to\\nus. In the same manner there must be a selection among our interests\\nthemselves.\\n\\nTHE MISTAKE OF FOLLOWING TOO MANY INTERESTS.--It is possible for us to\\nbecome interested in so many lines of activity that we do none of them\\nwell. This leads to a life so full of hurry and stress that we forget\\nlife in our busy living. Says James with respect to the necessity of\\nmaking a choice among our interests:\\n\\n\"With most objects of desire, physical nature restricts our choice to\\nbut one of many represented goods, and even so it is here. I am often\\nconfronted by the necessity of standing by one of my empirical selves\\nand relinquishing the rest. Not that I would not, if I could, be both\\nhandsome and fat, and well dressed, and a great athlete, and make a\\nmillion a year; be a wit, a bon vivant, and a lady-killer, as well as a\\nphilosopher; a philanthropist, statesman, warrior, and African explorer,\\nas well as a \\'tone poet\\' and saint. But the thing is simply impossible.\\nThe millionaire\\'s work would run counter to the saint\\'s; the bon vivant\\nand the philosopher and the lady-killer could not well keep house in the\\nsame tenement of clay. Such different characters may conceivably at the\\noutset of life be alike possible to man. But to make any one of them\\nactual, the rest must more or less be suppressed. The seeker of his\\ntruest, strongest, deepest self must review the list carefully, and pick\\nout the one on which to stake his salvation.\"\\n\\nINTERESTS MAY BE TOO NARROW.--On the other hand, it is just as possible\\nfor our interests to be too narrow as too broad. The one who has\\ncultivated no interests outside of his daily round of humdrum activities\\ndoes not get enough out of life. It is possible to become so engrossed\\nwith making a living that we forget to live--to become so habituated to\\nsome narrow treadmill of labor with the limited field of thought\\nsuggested by its environment, that we miss the richest experiences of\\nlife. Many there are who live a barren, trivial, and self-centered life\\nbecause they fail to see the significant and the beautiful which lie\\njust beyond where their interests reach! Many there are so taken up with\\ntheir own petty troubles that they have no heart or sympathy for fellow\\nhumanity! Many there are so absorbed with their own little achievements\\nthat they fail to catch step with the progress of the age!\\n\\nSPECIALIZATION SHOULD NOT COME TOO EARLY.--It is not well to specialize\\ntoo early in our interests. We miss too many rich fields which lie ready\\nfor the harvesting, and whose gleaning would enrich our lives. The\\nstudent who is so buried in books that he has no time for athletic\\nrecreations or social diversions is making a mistake equally with the\\none who is so enthusiastic an athlete and social devotee that he\\nneglects his studies. Likewise, the youth who is so taken up with the\\nstudy of one particular line that he applies himself to this at the\\nexpense of all other lines is inviting a distorted growth. Youth is the\\ntime for pushing the sky line back on all sides; it is the time for\\ncultivating diverse and varied lines of interests if we would grow into\\na rich experience in our later lives. The physical must be developed,\\nbut not at the expense of the mental, and vice versa. The social must\\nnot be neglected, but it must not be indulged to such an extent that\\nother interests suffer. Interest in amusements and recreations should be\\ncultivated, but these should never run counter to the moral and\\nreligious.\\n\\nSpecialization is necessary, but specialization in our interests should\\nrest upon a broad field of fundamental interests, in order that the\\nselection of the special line may be an intelligent one, and that our\\nspecialty shall not prove a rut in which we become so deeply buried that\\nwe are lost to the best in life.\\n\\nA PROPER BALANCE TO BE SOUGHT.--It behooves us, then, to find a proper\\nbalance in cultivating our interests, making them neither too broad nor\\ntoo narrow. We should deliberately seek to discover those which are\\nstrong enough to point the way to a life vocation, but this should not\\nbe done until we have had an opportunity to become acquainted with\\nvarious lines of interests. Otherwise our decision in this important\\nmatter may be based merely on a whim.\\n\\nWe should also decide what interests we should cultivate for our own\\npersonal development and happiness, and for the service we are to render\\nin a sphere outside our immediate vocation. We should consider\\navocations as well as vocations. Whatever interests are selected should\\nbe carried to efficiency. Better a reasonable number of carefully\\nselected interests well developed and resulting in efficiency than a\\nmultitude of interests which lead us into so many fields that we can at\\nbest get but a smattering of each, and that by neglecting the things\\nwhich should mean the most to us. Our interests should lead us to live\\nwhat Wagner calls a \"simple life,\" but not a narrow one.\\n\\n\\n5. INTEREST FUNDAMENTAL IN EDUCATION\\n\\nSome educators have feared that in finding our occupations interesting,\\nwe shall lose all power of effort and self-direction; that the will, not\\nbeing called sufficiently into requisition, must suffer from non-use;\\nthat we shall come to do the interesting and agreeable things well\\nenough, but fail before the disagreeable.\\n\\nINTEREST NOT ANTAGONISTIC TO EFFORT.--The best development of the will\\ndoes not come through our being forced to do acts in which there is\\nabsolutely no interest. Work done under compulsion never secures the\\nfull self in its performance. It is done mechanically and usually under\\nsuch a spirit of rebellion on the part of the doer, that the advantage\\nof such training may well be doubted. Nor are we safe in assuming that\\ntasks done without interest as the motive are always performed under the\\ndirection of the will. It is far more likely that they are done under\\nsome external compulsion, and that the will has, after all, but very\\nlittle to do with it. A boy may get an uninteresting lesson at school\\nwithout much pressure from his will, providing he is sufficiently afraid\\nof the master. In order that the will may receive training through\\ncompelling the performance of certain acts, it must have a reasonably\\nfree field, with external pressure removed. The compelling force must\\ncome from within, and not from without.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is not the least danger that we shall ever find\\na place in life where all the disagreeable is removed, and all phases of\\nour work made smooth and interesting. The necessity will always be\\nrising to call upon effort to take up the fight and hold us to duty\\nwhere interest has failed. And it is just here that there must be no\\nfailure, else we shall be mere creatures of circumstance, drifting with\\nevery eddy in the tide of our life, and never able to breast the\\ncurrent. Interest is not to supplant the necessity for stern and\\nstrenuous endeavor but rather to call forth the largest measure of\\nendeavor of which the self is capable. It is to put at work a larger\\namount of power than can be secured in any other way; in place of\\nsupplanting the will, it is to give it its point of departure and render\\nits service all the more effective.\\n\\nINTEREST AND CHARACTER.--Finally, we are not to forget that bad\\ninterests have the same propulsive power as good ones, and will lead to\\nacts just as surely. And these acts will just as readily be formed into\\nhabits. It is worth noticing that back of the act lies an interest; in\\nthe act lies the seed of a habit; ahead of the act lies behavior, which\\ngrows into conduct, this into character, and character into destiny. Bad\\ninterests should be shunned and discouraged. But even that is not\\nenough. Good interests must be installed in the place of the bad ones\\nfrom which we wish to escape, for it is through substitution rather\\nthan suppression that we are able to break from the bad and adhere to\\nthe good.\\n\\nOur interests are an evolution. Out of the simple interests of the child\\ngrow the more complex interests of the man. Lacking the opportunity to\\ndevelop the interests of childhood, the man will come somewhat short of\\nthe full interests of manhood. The great thing, then, in educating a\\nchild is to discover the fundamental interests which come to him from\\nthe race and, using these as a starting point, direct them into\\nconstantly broadening and more serviceable ones. Out of the early\\ninterest in play is to come the later interest in work; out of the early\\ninterest in collecting treasure boxes full of worthless trinkets and old\\nscraps comes the later interest in earning and retaining ownership of\\nproperty; out of the interest in chums and playmates come the larger\\nsocial interests; out of interest in nature comes the interest of the\\nnaturalist. And so one by one we may examine the interests which bear\\nthe largest fruit in our adult life, and we find that they all have\\ntheir roots in some early interest of childhood, which was encouraged\\nand given a chance to grow.\\n\\n\\n6. ORDER OF DEVELOPMENT OF OUR INTERESTS\\n\\nThe order in which our interests develop thus becomes an important\\nquestion in our education. Nor is the order an arbitrary one, as might\\nappear on first thought; for interest follows the invariable law of\\nattaching to the activity for which the organism is at that time ready,\\nand which it then needs in its further growth. That we are sometimes\\ninterested in harmful things does not disprove this assertion. The\\ninterest in its fundamental aspect is good, and but needs more healthful\\nenvironment or more wise direction. While space forbids a full\\ndiscussion of the genetic phase of interest here, yet we may profit by a\\nbrief statement of the fundamental interests of certain well-marked\\nperiods in our development.\\n\\nTHE INTERESTS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD.--The interests of early childhood are\\nchiefly connected with ministering to the wants of the organism as\\nexpressed in the appetites, and in securing control of the larger\\nmuscles. Activity is the preëminent thing--racing and romping are worth\\ndoing for their own sake alone. Imitation is strong, curiosity is\\nrising, and imagination is building a new world. Speech is a joy,\\nlanguage is learned with ease, and rhyme and rhythm become second\\nnature. The interests of this stage are still very direct and immediate.\\nA distant end does not attract. The thing must be worth doing for the\\nsake of the doing. Since the young child\\'s life is so full of action,\\nand since it is out of acts that habits grow, it is doubly desirous\\nduring this period that environment, models, and teaching should all\\ndirect his interests and activities into lines that will lead to\\npermanent values.\\n\\nTHE INTERESTS OF LATER CHILDHOOD.--In the period from second dentition\\nto puberty there is a great widening in the scope of interests, as well\\nas a noticeable change in their character. Activity is still the\\nkeynote; but the child is no longer interested merely in the doing, but\\nis now able to look forward to the end sought. Interests which are\\nsomewhat indirect now appeal to him, and the how of things attracts his\\nattention. He is beginning to reach outside of his own little circle,\\nand is ready for handicraft, reading, history, and science. Spelling,\\nwriting, and arithmetic interest him partly from the activities\\ninvolved, but more as a means to an end.\\n\\nInterest in complex games and plays increases, but the child is not yet\\nready for games which require team work. He has not come to the point\\nwhere he is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of all. Interest\\nin moral questions is beginning, and right and wrong are no longer\\nthings which may or may not be done without rebuke or punishment. The\\ngreat problem at this stage is to direct the interest into ways of\\nadapting the means to ends and into willingness to work under voluntary\\nattention for the accomplishment of the desired end.\\n\\nTHE INTERESTS OF ADOLESCENCE.--Finally, with the advent of puberty,\\ncomes the last stage in the development of interests before adult life.\\nThis period is not marked by the birth of new interests so much as by a\\ndeepening and broadening of those already begun. The end sought becomes\\nan increasingly larger factor, whether in play or in work. Mere activity\\nitself no longer satisfies. The youth can now play team games; for his\\nsocial interests are taking shape, and he can subordinate himself for\\nthe good of the group. Interest in the opposite sex takes on a new\\nphase, and social form and mode of dress receive attention. A new\\nconsciousness of self emerges, and the youth becomes introspective.\\nQuestions of the ultimate meaning of things press for solution, and what\\nand who am I, demands an answer.\\n\\nAt this age we pass from a régime of obedience to one of self-control,\\nfrom an ethics of authority to one of individualism. All the interests\\nare now taking on a more definite and stable form, and are looking\\nseriously toward life vocations. This is a time of big plans and\\nstrenuous activity. It is a crucial period in our life, fraught with\\npitfalls and dangers, with privileges and opportunities. At this\\nstrategic point in our life\\'s voyage we may anchor ourselves with right\\ninterests to a safe manhood and a successful career; or we may, with\\nwrong interests, bind ourselves to a broken life of discouragement and\\ndefeat.\\n\\n\\n7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Try making a list of your most important interests in order of their\\nstrength. Suppose you had made such a list five years ago, where would\\nit have differed from the present list? Are you ever obliged to perform\\nany activities in which you have little or no interest, either directly\\nor indirectly? Can you name any activities in which you once had a\\nstrong interest but which you now perform chiefly from force of habit\\nand without much interest?\\n\\n2. Have you any interests of which you are not proud? On the other hand,\\ndo you lack certain interests which you feel that you should possess?\\nWhat interests are you now trying especially to cultivate? To suppress?\\nHave you as broad a field of interests as you can well take care of?\\nHave you so many interests that you are slighting the development of\\nsome of the more important ones?\\n\\n3. Observe several recitations for differences in the amount of interest\\nshown. Account for these differences. Have you ever observed an\\nenthusiastic teacher with an uninterested class? A dull, listless\\nteacher with an interested class?\\n\\n4. A father offers his son a dollar for every grade on his term report\\nwhich is above ninety; what type of interest relative to studies does\\nthis appeal to? What do you think of the advisability of giving prizes\\nin connection with school work?\\n\\n5. Most children in the elementary school are not interested in\\ntechnical grammar; why not? Histories made up chiefly of dates and lists\\nof kings or presidents are not interesting; what is the remedy? Would\\nyou call any teaching of literature, history, geography, or science\\nsuccessful which fails to develop an interest in the subject?\\n\\n6. After careful observation, make a statement of the differences in the\\ntypical play interests of boys and girls; of children of the third grade\\nand the eighth grade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nTHE WILL\\n\\n\\nThe fundamental fact in all ranges of life from the lowest to the\\nhighest is _activity_, _doing_. Every individual, either animal or man,\\nis constantly meeting situations which demand response. In the lower\\nforms of life, this response is very simple, while in the higher forms,\\nand especially in man, it is very complex. The bird sees a nook\\nfavorable for a nest, and at once appropriates it; a man sees a house\\nthat strikes his fancy, and works and plans and saves for months to\\nsecure money with which to buy it. It is evident that the larger the\\npossible number of responses, and the greater their diversity and\\ncomplexity, the more difficult it will be to select and compel the right\\nresponse to any given situation. Man therefore needs some special power\\nof control over his acts--he requires a _will._\\n\\n\\n1. THE NATURE OF THE WILL\\n\\nThere has been much discussion and not a little controversy as to the\\ntrue nature of the will. Just what _is_ the will, and what is the\\ncontent of our mental stream when we are in the act of willing? Is there\\nat such times a new and distinctly different content which we do not\\nfind in our processes of knowledge or emotion--such as perception,\\nmemory, judgment, interest, desire? Or do we find, when we are engaged\\nin an act of the will, that the mental stream contains only the\\nfamiliar old elements of attention, perception, judgment, desire,\\npurpose, etc., _all organized or set for the purpose of accomplishing or\\npreventing some act_?\\n\\nTHE CONTENT OF THE WILL.--We shall not attempt here to settle the\\ncontroversy suggested by the foregoing questions, nor, for immediately\\npractical purposes, do we need to settle it. It is perhaps safe to say,\\nhowever, that whenever we are willing the mental content consists of\\nelements of cognition and feeling _plus a distinct sense of effort_,\\nwith which everyone is familiar. Whether this sense of effort is a new\\nand different element, or only a complex of old and familiar mental\\nprocesses, we need not now decide.\\n\\nTHE FUNCTION OF THE WILL.--Concerning the function of the will there can\\nbe no haziness or doubt. _Volition concerns itself wholly with acts,\\nresponses._ The will always has to do with causing or inhibiting some\\naction, either physical or mental. We need to go to the dentist, tell\\nsome friend we were in the wrong, hold our mind to a difficult or\\nuninteresting task, or do some other disagreeable thing from which we\\nshirk. It is at such points that we must call upon the will.\\n\\nAgain, we must restrain our tongue from speaking the unkind word, keep\\nfrom crying out when the dentist drills the tooth, check some unworthy\\nline of thought. We must here also appeal to the will. We may conclude\\nthen that the will is needed whenever the physical or mental activity\\nmust be controlled _with effort_. Some writers have called the work of\\nthe will in compelling action its _positive_ function, and in inhibiting\\naction its _negative_ function.\\n\\nHOW THE WILL EXERTS ITS COMPULSION.--How does the will bring its\\ncompulsion to bear? It is not a kind of mental policeman who can take\\nus by the collar, so to speak, and say _do this_, or _do not do that_.\\nThe secret of the will\\'s power of control lies in _attention_. It is the\\nline of action that we hold the mind upon with an attitude of intending\\nto perform it that we finally follow. It is the thing we keep thinking\\nabout that we finally do.\\n\\nOn the other hand, let us resolutely hold the mind away from some\\nattractive but unsuitable line of action, directing our thoughts to an\\nopposite course, or to some wholly different subject, and we have\\neffectually blocked the wrong response. To control our acts is therefore\\nto control our thoughts, and strength of will can be measured by our\\nability to direct our attention.\\n\\n\\n2. THE EXTENT OF VOLUNTARY CONTROL OVER OUR ACTS\\n\\nA relatively small proportion of our acts, or responses, are controlled\\nby volition. Nature, in her wise economy, has provided a simpler and\\neasier method than to have all our actions performed or checked with\\nconscious effort.\\n\\nCLASSES OF ACTS OR RESPONSE.--Movements or acts, like other phenomena,\\ndo not just happen. They never occur without a cause back of them.\\nWhether they are performed with a conscious end in view or without it,\\nthe fact remains the same--something must lie back of the act to account\\nfor its performance. During the last hour, each of us has performed many\\nsimple movements and more or less complex acts. These acts have varied\\ngreatly in character. Of many we were wholly unconscious. Others were\\nconsciously performed, but without feeling of effort on our part. Still\\nothers were accomplished only with effort, and after a struggle to\\ndecide which of two lines of action we should take. Some of our acts\\nwere reflex, some were chiefly instinctive, and some were volitional.\\n\\nSIMPLE REFLEX ACTS.--First, there are going on within every living\\norganism countless movements of which he is in large part unconscious,\\nwhich he does nothing to initiate, and which he is largely powerless to\\nprevent. Some of them are wholly, and others almost, out of the reach\\nand power of his will. Such are the movements of the heart and vascular\\nsystem, the action of the lungs in breathing, the movements of the\\ndigestive tract, the work of the various glands in their process of\\nsecretion. The entire organism is a mass of living matter, and just\\nbecause it is living no part of it is at rest.\\n\\nMovements of this type require no external stimulus and no direction,\\nthey are _reflex_; they take care of themselves, as long as the body is\\nin health, without let or hindrance, continuing whether we sleep or\\nwake, even if we are in hypnotic or anæsthetic coma. With movements of\\nreflex type we shall have no more concern, since they are almost wholly\\nphysiological, and come scarcely at all within the range of the\\nconsciousness.\\n\\nINSTINCTIVE ACTS.--Next there are a large number of such acts as closing\\nthe eyes when they are threatened, starting back from danger, crying out\\nfrom pain or alarm, frowning and striking when angry. These may roughly\\nbe classed as instinctive, and have already been discussed under that\\nhead. They differ from the former class in that they require some\\nstimulus to set the act off. We are fully conscious of their\\nperformance, although they are performed without a conscious end in\\nview. Winking the eyes serves an important purpose, but that is not why\\nwe wink; starting back from danger is a wise thing to do, but we do not\\nstop to consider this before performing the act.\\n\\nAnd so it is with a multitude of reflex and instinctive acts. They are\\nperformed immediately upon receiving an appropriate stimulus, because we\\npossess an organism calculated to act in a definite way in response to\\ncertain stimuli. There is no need for, and indeed no place for, anything\\nto come in between the stimulus and the act. The stimulus pulls the\\ntrigger of the ready-set nervous system, and the act follows at once.\\nActs of these reflex and instinctive types do not come properly within\\nthe range of volition, hence we will not consider them further.\\n\\nAUTOMATIC OR SPONTANEOUS ACTS.--Growing out of these reflex and\\ninstinctive acts is a broad field of action which may be called\\n_automatic_ or _spontaneous_. The distinguishing feature of this type of\\naction is that all such acts, though performed now largely without\\nconscious purpose or intent, were at one time purposed acts, performed\\nwith effort; this is to say that they were volitional. Such acts as\\nwriting, or fingering the keyboard of a piano, were once consciously\\npurposed, volitional acts selected from many random or reflex movements.\\n\\nThe effects of experience and habit are such, however, that soon the\\nmere presence of pencil and paper, or the sight of the keyboard, is\\nenough to set one scribbling or playing. Stated differently, certain\\nobjects and situations come to suggest certain characteristic acts or\\nresponses so strongly that the action follows immediately on the heels\\nof the percept of the object, or the idea of the act. James calls such\\naction _ideo-motor_. Many illustrations of this type of acts will occur\\nto each of us: A door starts to blow shut, and we spring up and avert\\nthe slam. The memory of a neglected engagement comes to us, and we have\\nstarted to our feet on the instant. A dish of nuts stands before us, and\\nwe find ourselves nibbling without intending to do so.\\n\\nTHE CYCLE FROM VOLITIONAL TO AUTOMATIC.--It is of course evident that no\\nsuch acts, though they were at one time in our experience volitional,\\nnow require effort or definite intention for their performance. The law\\ncovering this point may be stated as follows: _All volitional acts, when\\nrepeated, tend, through the effects of habit, to become automatic, and\\nthus relieve the will from the necessity of directing them._\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Star for mirror drawing. The mirror breaks up\\nthe automatic control previously developed, and requires one to start\\nout much as the child does at the beginning. See text for directions.]\\n\\nTo illustrate this law try the following experiment: Draw on a piece of\\ncardboard a star, like figure 19, making each line segment two inches.\\nSeat yourself at a table with the star before you, placing a mirror back\\nof the star so that it can be seen in the mirror. Have someone hold a\\nscreen a few inches above the table so as to hide the star from your\\ndirect view, but so that you can see it in the mirror. Now reach your\\nhand under the screen and trace with a pencil around the star from left\\nto right, not taking your pencil off the paper until you get clear\\naround. Keep track of how long it takes to go around and also note the\\nirregular wanderings of your pencil. Try this experiment five times\\nover, noting the decrease in time and effort required, and the increase\\nin efficiency as the movements tend to become automatic.\\n\\nVOLITIONAL ACTION.--While it is obvious that the various types of action\\nalready described include a very large proportion of all our acts, yet\\nthey do not include all. For there are some acts that are neither reflex\\nnor instinctive nor automatic, but that have to be performed under the\\nstress of compulsion and effort. We constantly meet situations where the\\nnecessity for action or restraint runs counter to our inclinations. We\\ndaily are confronted by the necessity of making decisions in which the\\nmind must be compelled by effort to take this direction or that\\ndirection. Conflicting motives or tendencies create frequent necessity\\nfor coercion. It is often necessary to drive our bark counter to the\\ncurrent of our desires or our habits, or to enter into conflict with a\\ntemptation.\\n\\nVOLITION ACTS IN THE MAKING OF DECISIONS.--Everyone knows for himself\\nthe state of inward unrest which we call indecision. A thought enters\\nthe mind which would of itself prompt an act; but before the act can\\noccur, a contrary idea appears and the act is checked; another thought\\ncomes favoring the act, and is in turn counterbalanced by an opposing\\none. The impelling and inhibiting ideas we call _motives_ or _reasons_\\nfor and against the proposed act. While we are balancing the motives\\nagainst each other, we are said to _deliberate_. This process of\\ndeliberation must go on, if we continue to think about the matter at\\nall, until one set of ideas has triumphed over the other and secured the\\nattention. When this has occurred, we have _decided_, and the\\ndeliberation is at an end. We have exercised the highest function of the\\nwill and made a _choice_.\\n\\nSometimes the battle of motives is short, the decision being reached as\\nsoon as there is time to summon all the reasons on both sides of the\\nquestion. At other times the conflict may go on at intervals for days or\\nweeks, neither set of motives being strong enough to vanquish the other\\nand dictate the decision. When the motives are somewhat evenly balanced\\nwe wisely pause in making a decision, because when one line of action is\\ntaken, the other cannot be, and we hesitate to lose either opportunity.\\nA state of indecision is usually highly unpleasant, and no doubt more\\nthan one decision has been hastened in our lives simply that we might be\\ndone with the unpleasantness attendant on the consideration of two\\ncontrary and insistent sets of motives.\\n\\nIt is of the highest importance when making a decision of any\\nconsequence that we should be fair in considering all the reasons on\\nboth sides of the question, allowing each its just weight. Nor is this\\nas easy as it might appear; for, as we saw in our study of the emotions,\\nour feeling attitude toward any object that occupies the mind is largely\\nresponsible for the subjective value we place upon it. It is easy to be\\nso prejudiced toward or against a line of action that the motives\\nbearing upon it cannot get fair consideration. To be able to eliminate\\nthis personal factor to such an extent that the evidence before us on a\\nquestion may be considered on its merits is a rare accomplishment.\\n\\nTYPES OF DECISION.--A decision may be reached in a variety of ways, the\\nmost important ones of which may now briefly be described after the\\ngeneral plan suggested by Professor James:\\n\\nTHE REASONABLE TYPE.--One of the simplest types of decision is that in\\nwhich the preponderance of motives is clearly seen to be on one side or\\nthe other, and the only rational thing to do is to decide in accordance\\nwith the weight of evidence. Decisions of this type are called\\n_reasonable_. If we discover ten reasons why we should pursue a certain\\ncourse of action, and only one or two reasons of equal weight why we\\nshould not, then the decision ought not to be hard to make. The points\\nto watch in this case are (a) that we have really discovered all the\\nimportant reasons on both sides of the case, and (b) that our feelings\\nof personal interest or prejudice have not given some of the motives an\\nundue weight in our scale of values.\\n\\nACCIDENTAL TYPE: EXTERNAL MOTIVES.--It is to be doubted whether as many\\nof our decisions are made under immediate stress of volition as we\\nthink. We may be hesitating between two sets of motives, unable to\\ndecide between them, when a third factor enters which is not really\\nrelated to the question at all, but which finally dictates the decision\\nnevertheless. For example, we are considering the question whether we\\nshall go on an excursion or stay at home and complete a piece of work.\\nThe benefits coming from the recreation, and the pleasures of the trip,\\nare pitted against the expense which must be incurred and the\\ndesirability of having the work done on time. At this point, while as\\nyet we have been unable to decide, a friend comes along, and we seek to\\nevade the responsibility of making our own decision by appealing to him,\\n\"You tell me what to do!\" How few of us have never said in effect if not\\nin words, \"I will do this or that if you will\"! How few have never taken\\nadvantage of a rainy day to stay from church or shirk an undesirable\\nengagement! How few have not allowed important questions to be decided\\nby some trivial or accidental factor not really related to the choice in\\nthe least!\\n\\nThis form of decision is _accidental decision_. It does not rest on\\nmotives which are vitally related to the case, but rather on the\\naccident of external circumstances. The person who habitually makes his\\ndecisions in this way lacks power of will. He does not hold himself to\\nthe question until he has gathered the evidence before him, and then\\nhimself direct his attention to the best line of action and so secure\\nits performance. He drifts with the tide, he goes with the crowd, he\\nshirks responsibility.\\n\\nACCIDENTAL TYPE: SUBJECTIVE MOTIVES.--A second type of _accidental_\\ndecision may occur when we are hesitating between two lines of action\\nwhich are seemingly about equally desirable, and no preponderating\\nmotive enters the field; when no external factor appears, and no\\nadvising friend comes to the rescue. Then, with the necessity for\\ndeciding thrust upon us, we tire of the worry and strain of deliberation\\nand say to ourselves, \"This thing must be settled one way or the other\\npretty soon; I am tired of the whole matter.\" When we have reached this\\npoint we are likely to shut our eyes to the evidence in the case, and\\ndecide largely upon the whim or mood of the moment. Very likely we\\nregret our decision the next instant, but without any more cause for\\nthe regret than we had for the decision.\\n\\nIt is evident that such a decision as this does not rest on valid\\nmotives but rather on the accident of subjective conditions. Habitual\\ndecisions of this type are an evidence of a mental laziness or a mental\\nincompetence which renders the individual incapable of marshaling the\\nfacts bearing on a case. He cannot hold them before his mind and weigh\\nthem against each other until one side outweighs the other and dictates\\nthe decision. Of course the remedy for this weakness of decision lies in\\nnot allowing oneself to be pushed into a decision simply to escape the\\nunpleasantness of a state of indecision, or the necessity of searching\\nfor further evidence which will make the decision easier.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is possible to form a habit of _indecision_, of\\nundue hesitancy in coming to conclusions when the evidence is all before\\nus. This gives us the mental dawdler, the person who will spend several\\nminutes in an agony of indecision over whether to carry an umbrella on\\nthis particular trip; whether to wear black shoes or tan shoes today;\\nwhether to go calling or to stay at home and write letters this\\nafternoon. Such a person is usually in a stew over some inconsequential\\nmatter, and consumes so much time and energy in fussing over trivial\\nthings that he is incapable of handling larger ones. If we are certain\\nthat we have all the facts in a given case before us, and have given\\neach its due weight so far as our judgment will enable us to do, then\\nthere is nothing to be gained by delaying the decision. Nor is there any\\noccasion to change the decision after it has once been made unless new\\nevidence is discovered bearing on the case.\\n\\nDECISION UNDER EFFORT.--The highest type of decision is that in which\\neffort is the determining factor. The pressure of external circumstances\\nand inward impulse is not enough to overcome a calm and determined _I\\nwill_. Two possible lines of action may lie open before us. Every\\ncurrent of our being leads toward the one; in addition, inclination,\\nfriends, honors, all beckon in the same direction. From the other course\\nour very nature shrinks; duty alone bids us take this line, and promises\\nno rewards except the approval of conscience. Here is the crucial point\\nin human experience; the supreme test of the individual; the last\\nmeasure of man\\'s independence and power. Winning at this point man has\\nexercised his highest prerogative--that of independent choice; failing\\nhere, he reverts toward the lower forms and is a creature of\\ncircumstance, no longer the master of his own destiny, but blown about\\nby the winds of chance. And it behooves us to win in this battle. We may\\nlose in a contest or a game and yet not fail, because we have done our\\nbest; if we fail in the conflict of motives we have planted a seed of\\nweakness from which we shall at last harvest defeat.\\n\\nJean Valjean, the galley slave of almost a score of years, escapes and\\nlives an honest life. He wins the respect and admiration of friends; he\\nis elected mayor of his town, and honors are heaped on him. At the\\nheight of his prosperity he reads one day that a man has been arrested\\nin another town for the escaped convict, Jean Valjean, and is about to\\nbe sent to the galleys. Now comes the supreme test in Jean Valjean\\'s\\nlife. Shall he remain the honored, respected citizen and let an innocent\\nman suffer in his stead, or shall he proclaim himself the long-sought\\ncriminal and again have the collar riveted on his neck and take his\\nplace at the oars? He spends one awful night of conflict in which\\ncontending motives make a battle ground of his soul. But in the morning\\nhe has won. He has saved his manhood. His conscience yet lives--and he\\ngoes and gives himself up to the officers. Nor could he do otherwise and\\nstill remain a _man_.\\n\\n\\n3. STRONG AND WEAK WILLS\\n\\nMany persons will admit that their memory or imagination or power of\\nperception is not good, but few will confess to a weak will. Strength of\\nwill is everywhere lauded as a mark of worth and character. How can we\\ntell whether our will is strong or weak?\\n\\nNOT A WILL, BUT WILLS.--First of all we need to remember that, just as\\nwe do not have a memory, but a system of memories, so we do not possess\\na will, but many different wills. By this I mean that the will must be\\ncalled upon and tested at every point of contact in experience before we\\nhave fully measured its strength. Our will may have served us reasonably\\nwell so far, but we may not yet have met any great number of hard tests\\nbecause our experience and temptations have been limited.\\n\\nNor must we forget to take into account both the negative and the\\npositive functions of the will. Many there are who think of the will\\nchiefly in its negative use, as a kind of a check or barrier to save us\\n_from_ doing certain things. That this is an important function cannot\\nbe denied. But the positive is the higher function. There are many men\\nand women who are able to resist evil, but able to do little good. They\\nare good enough, but not good for much. They lack the power of effort\\nand self-compulsion to hold them up to the high standards and stern\\nendeavor necessary to save them from inferiority or mediocrity. It is\\nalmost certain that for most who read these words the greatest test of\\ntheir will power will be in the positive instead of the negative\\ndirection.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE TESTS A FALSE MEASURE OF WILL POWER.--The actual amount of\\nvolition exercised in making a decision cannot be measured by objective\\nresults. The fact that you follow the pathway of duty, while I falter\\nand finally drift into the byways of pleasure, is not certain evidence\\nthat you have put forth the greater power of will. In the first place,\\nthe allurements which led me astray may have had no charms for you.\\nFurthermore, you may have so formed the habit of pursuing the pathway of\\nduty when the two paths opened before you, that your well-trained feet\\nunerringly led you into the narrow way without a struggle. Of course you\\nare on safer ground than I, and on ground that we should all seek to\\nattain. But, nevertheless, I, although I fell when I should have stood,\\nmay have been fighting a battle and manifesting a power of resistance of\\nwhich you, under similar temptation, would have been incapable. The only\\npoint from which a conflict of motives can be safely judged is that of\\nthe soul which is engaged in the struggle.\\n\\n\\n4. VOLITIONAL TYPES\\n\\nSeveral fairly well-marked volitional types may be discovered. It is, of\\ncourse, to be understood that these types all grade by insensible\\ndegrees into each other, and that extreme types are the exception rather\\nthan the rule.\\n\\nTHE IMPULSIVE TYPE.--The _impulsive_ type of will goes along with a\\nnervous organism of the hair-trigger kind. The brain is in a state of\\nhighly unstable equilibrium, and a relatively slight current serves to\\nset off the motor centers. Action follows before there is time for a\\ncounteracting current to intervene. Putting it in mental terms, we act\\non an idea which presents itself before an opposing one has opportunity\\nto enter the mind. Hence _the action is largely or wholly ideo-motor and\\nbut slightly or not at all deliberate_. It is this type of will which\\nresults in the hasty word or deed, or the rash act committed on the\\nimpulse of the moment and repented of at leisure; which compels the\\nfrequent, \"I didn\\'t think, or I would not have done it!\" The impulsive\\nperson may undoubtedly have credited up to him many kind words and noble\\ndeeds. In addition, he usually carries with him an air of spontaneity\\nand whole-heartedness which goes far to atone for his faults. The fact\\nremains, however, that he is too little the master of his acts, that he\\nis guided too largely by external circumstances or inward caprice. He\\nlacks balance.\\n\\nImpulsive action is not to be confused with quick decision and rapid\\naction. Many of the world\\'s greatest and safest leaders have been noted\\nfor quickness of decision and for rapidity of action in carrying out\\ntheir decisions. It must be remembered, however, that these men were\\nmaking decisions in fields well known to them. They were specialists in\\nthis line of deliberation. The motives for and against certain lines of\\naction had often been dwelt upon. All possible contingencies had been\\nimaged many times over, and a valuation placed upon the different\\ndecisions. The various concepts had long been associated with certain\\ndefinite lines of action. Deliberation under such conditions can be\\ncarried on with lightning rapidity, each motive being checked off as\\nworth so much the instant it presents itself, and action can follow\\nimmediately when attention settles on the proper motive to govern the\\ndecision. This is not impulse, but abbreviated deliberation. These\\nfacts suggest to us that we should think much and carefully over matters\\nin which we are required to make quick decisions.\\n\\nOf course the remedy for the over-impulsive type is to cultivate\\ndeliberative action. When the impulse comes to act without\\nconsideration, pause to give the other side of the question an\\nopportunity to be heard. Check the motor response to ideas that suggest\\naction until you have reviewed the field to see whether there are\\ncontrary reasons to be taken into account. Form the habit of waiting for\\nall evidence before deciding. \"Think twice\" before you act.\\n\\nTHE OBSTRUCTED WILL.--The opposite of the impulsive type of will is the\\n_obstructed_ or _balky_ will. In this type there is too much inhibition,\\nor else not enough impulsion. Images which should result in action are\\ncheckmated by opposing images, or do not possess vitality enough as\\nmotives to overcome the dead weight of inertia which clogs mental\\naction. The person knows well enough what he should do, but he cannot\\nget started. He \"cannot get the consent of his will.\" It may be the\\nstudent whose mind is tormented by thoughts of coming failure in\\nrecitation or examination, but who yet cannot force himself to the\\nexertion necessary safely to meet the ordeal. It may be the dissolute\\nman who tortures himself in his sober moments with remorse and the\\nthought that he was intended for better things, but who, waking from his\\nmeditations, goes on in the same old way. It may be the child undergoing\\npunishment, who is to be released from bondage as soon as he will\\npromise to be good, but who cannot bring himself to say the necessary\\nwords. It not only may be, but is, man or woman anywhere who has ideals\\nwhich are known to be worthy and noble, but which fail to take hold. It\\nis anyone who is following a course of action which he knows is beneath\\nhim.\\n\\nNo one can doubt that the moral tragedies, the failures and the\\nshipwrecks in life come far more from the breaking of the bonds which\\nshould bind right ideals to action than from a failure to perceive the\\ntruth. Men differ far more in their deeds than in their standards of\\naction.\\n\\nThe remedy for this diseased type of will is much easier to prescribe\\nthan to apply. It is simply to refuse to attend to the contrary thoughts\\nwhich are blocking action, and to cultivate and encourage those which\\nlead to action of the right kind. It is seeking to vitalize our good\\nimpulses and render them effective by acting on them whenever\\nopportunity offers. Nothing can be accomplished by moodily dwelling on\\nthe disgrace of harboring the obstructing ideas. Thus brooding over them\\nonly encourages them. What we need is to get entirely away from the line\\nof thought in which we have met our obstruction, and approach the matter\\nfrom a different direction. The child who is in a fit of sulks does not\\nso much need a lecture on the disagreeable habit he is forming as to\\nhave his thoughts led into lines not connected with the grievance which\\nis causing him the trouble. The stubborn child does not need to have his\\nwill \"broken,\" but rather to have it strengthened. He may be compelled\\nto do what he does not want to do; but if this is accomplished through\\nphysical force instead of by leading to thoughts connected with the\\nperformance of the act, it may be doubted whether the will has in any\\ndegree been strengthened. Indeed it may rather be depended upon that the\\nwill has been weakened; for an opportunity for self-control, through\\nwhich alone the will develops, has been lost. The ultimate remedy for\\nrebellion often lies in greater freedom at the proper time. This does\\nnot mean that the child should not obey rightful authority promptly and\\nexplicitly, but that just as little external authority as possible\\nshould intervene to take from the child the opportunity for\\n_self_-compulsion.\\n\\nTHE NORMAL WILL.--The golden mean between these two abnormal types of\\nwill may be called the _normal_ or _balanced_ will. Here there is a\\nproper ratio between impulsion and inhibition. Ideas are not acted upon\\nthe instant they enter the mind without giving time for a survey of the\\nfield of motives, neither is action \"sicklied o\\'er with the pale cast of\\nthought\" to such an extent that it becomes impossible. The evidence is\\nall considered and each motive fully weighed. But this once done,\\ndecision follows. No dilatory and obstructive tactics are allowed. The\\nfleeting impulse is not enough to persuade to action, neither is action\\nunduly delayed after the decision is made.\\n\\n\\n5. TRAINING THE WILL\\n\\nThe will is to be trained as we train the other powers of the\\nmind--through the exercise of its normal function. The function of the\\nwill is to direct or control in the actual affairs of life. Many\\nwell-meaning persons speak of training the will as if we could separate\\nit from the interests and purposes of our daily living, and in some way\\nput it through its paces merely for the sake of adding to its general\\nstrength. This view is all wrong. There is, as we have seen, no such\\nthing as _general_ power of will. Will is always required in specific\\nacts and emergencies, and it is precisely upon such matters that it must\\nbe exercised if it is to be cultivated.\\n\\nWILL TO BE TRAINED IN COMMON ROUND OF DUTIES.--What is needed in\\ndeveloping the will is a deep moral interest in whatever we set out to\\ndo, and a high purpose to do it up to the limit of our powers. Without\\nthis, any artificial exercises, no matter how carefully they are devised\\nor how heroically they are carried out, cannot but fail to fit us for\\nthe real tests of life; with it, artificial exercises are superfluous.\\nIt matters not so much what our vocation as how it is performed. The\\nmost commonplace human experience is rich in opportunities for the\\nhighest form of expression possible to the will--that of directing us\\ninto right lines of action, and of holding us to our best in the\\naccomplishment of some dominant purpose.\\n\\nThere is no one set form of exercise which alone will serve to train the\\nwill. The student pushing steadily toward his goal in spite of poverty\\nand grinding labor; the teacher who, though unappreciated and poorly\\npaid, yet performs every duty with conscientious thoroughness; the man\\nwho stands firm in the face of temptation; the person whom heredity or\\ncircumstance has handicapped, but who, nevertheless, courageously fights\\nhis battle; the countless men and women everywhere whose names are not\\nknown to fame, but who stand in the hard places, bearing the heat and\\nthe toil with brave, unflinching hearts--these are the ones who are\\ndeveloping a moral fiber and strength of will which will stand in the\\nday of stress. Better a thousand times such training as this in the\\nthick of life\\'s real conflicts than any volitional calisthenics or\\npriggish self-denials entered into solely for the training of the will!\\n\\nSCHOOL WORK AND WILL TRAINING.--The work of the school offers as good an\\nopportunity for training powers of will as of memory or reasoning. On\\nthe side of inhibition there is always the necessity for self-restraint\\nand control so that the rights of others may not be infringed upon.\\nTemptations to unfairness or insincerity in lessons and examinations are\\nalways to be met. The social relations of the school necessitate the\\ndevelopment of personal poise and independence.\\n\\nOn the positive side the opportunities for the exercise of will power\\nare always at hand in the school. Every lesson gives the pupil a chance\\nto measure his strength and determination against the resistance of the\\ntask. High standards are to be built up, ideals maintained, habits\\nrendered secure.\\n\\nThe great problem for the teacher in this connection is so to organize\\nboth control and instruction that the largest possible opportunity is\\ngiven to pupils for the exercise of their own powers of will in all\\nschool relations.\\n\\n\\n6. FREEDOM OF THE WILL, OR THE EXTENT OF ITS CONTROL\\n\\nWe have seen in this discussion that will is a mode of control--control\\nof our thoughts and, through our thoughts, of our actions. Will may be\\nlooked upon, then, as the culmination of the mental life, the highest\\nform of directive agent within us. Beginning with the direction of the\\nsimplest movements, it goes on until it governs the current of our life\\nin the pursuit of some distant ideal.\\n\\nLIMITATIONS OF THE WILL.--Just how far the will can go in its control,\\njust how far man is a free moral agent, has long been one of the mooted\\nquestions among the philosophers. But some few facts are clear. If the\\nwill can exercise full control over all our acts, it by this very fact\\ndetermines our character; and character spells destiny. There is not the\\nleast doubt, however, that the will in thus directing us in the\\nachievement of a destiny works under two limitations: _First_, every\\nindividual enters upon life with a large stock of _inherited\\ntendencies_, which go far to shape his interests and aspirations. And\\nthese are important factors in the work of volition. _Second_, we all\\nhave our setting in the midst of a great _material and social\\nenvironment_, which is largely beyond our power to modify, and whose\\ninfluences are constantly playing upon us and molding us according to\\ntheir type.\\n\\nTHESE LIMITATIONS THE CONDITIONS OF FREEDOM.--Yet there is nothing in\\nthis thought to discourage us. For these very limitations have in them\\nour hope of a larger freedom. Man\\'s heredity, coming to him through ages\\nof conflict with the forces of nature, with his brother man, and with\\nhimself, has deeply instilled in him the spirit of independence and\\nself-control. It has trained him to deliberate, to choose, to achieve.\\nIt has developed in him the power _to will_. Likewise man\\'s environment,\\nin which he must live and work, furnishes the problems which his life\\nwork is to solve, and _out of whose solution will receives its only true\\ndevelopment_.\\n\\nIt is through the action and interaction of these two factors, then,\\nthat man is to work out his destiny. What he _is_, coupled with what he\\nmay _do_, leads him to what he may _become_. Every man possesses in some\\ndegree a spark of divinity, a sovereign individuality, a power of\\nindependent initiative. This is all he needs to make him free--free to\\ndo his best in whatever walk of life he finds himself. If he will but do\\nthis, the doing of it will lead him into a constantly growing freedom,\\nand he can voice the cry of every earnest heart:\\n\\n    Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul!\\n    As the swift seasons roll!\\n    Leave thy low-vaulted past!\\n    Let each new temple, nobler than the last,\\n    Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,\\n    Till thou at length art free,\\n    Leaving thine outgrown shell by life\\'s unresting sea!\\n\\n\\n7. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION\\n\\n1. Give illustrations from your own experience of the various types of\\naction mentioned in this discussion. From your own experience of the\\nlast hour, what examples of impulsive action can you give? Would it have\\nbeen better in some cases had you stopped to deliberate?\\n\\n2. Are you easily influenced by prejudice or personal preference in\\nmaking decisions? What recent decisions have been thus affected? Can you\\nclassify the various ones of your decisions which you can recall under\\nthe four types mentioned in the text? Under which class does the largest\\nnumber fall? Have you a tendency to drift with the crowd? Are you\\nindependent in deciding upon and following out a line of action? What is\\nthe value of advice? Ought advice to do more than to assist in getting\\nall the evidence on a case before the one who is to decide?\\n\\n3. Can you judge yourself well enough to tell to which volitional type\\nyou belong? Are you over-impulsive? Are you stubborn? What is the\\ndifference between stubbornness and firmness? Suppose you ask your\\ninstructor, or a friend, to assist you in classifying yourself as to\\nvolitional type. Are you troubled with indecision; that is, do you have\\nhard work to decide in trivial matters even after you know all the facts\\nin the case? What is the cause of these states of indecision? The\\nremedy?\\n\\n4. Have you a strong power of will? Can you control your attention? Do\\nyou submit easily to temptation? Can you hold yourself up to a high\\ndegree of effort? Can you persevere? Have you ever failed in the\\nattainment of some cherished ideal because you could not bring yourself\\nto pay the price in the sacrifice or effort necessary?\\n\\n5. Consider the class work and examinations of schools that you know.\\nDoes the system of management and control throw responsibility on the\\npupils in a way to develop their powers of will?\\n\\n6. What motives or incentives can be used to encourage pupils to use\\nself-compulsion to maintain high standards of excellence in their\\nstudies and conduct? Does it pay to be heroic in one\\'s self-control?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nSELF-EXPRESSION AND DEVELOPMENT\\n\\n\\nWe have already seen that the mind and the body are associated in a\\ncopartnership in which each is an indispensable and active member. We\\nhave seen that the body gets its dignity and worth from its relation\\nwith the mind, and that the mind is dependent on the body for the crude\\nmaterial of its thought, and also for the carrying out of its mandates\\nin securing adaptation to our environment. We have seen as a corollary\\nof these facts that the efficiency of both mind and body is conditioned\\nby the manner in which each carries out its share of the mutual\\nactivities. Let us see something more of this interrelation.\\n\\n\\n1. INTER-RELATION OF IMPRESSION AND EXPRESSION\\n\\n_No impression without corresponding expression_ has become a maxim in\\nboth physiology and psychology. Inner life implies self-expression in\\nexternal activities. The stream of impressions pouring in upon us hourly\\nfrom our environment must have means of expression if development is to\\nfollow. We cannot be passive recipients, but must be active participants\\nin the educational process. We must not only be able to _know_ and\\n_feel_, but to _do_.\\n\\n[Illustration: FIG. 20]\\n\\nTHE MANY SOURCES OF IMPRESSIONS.--The nature of the impressions which\\ncome to us and how they all lead on toward ultimate expression is shown\\nin the accompanying diagram (Fig. 20). Our material environment is\\nthrusting impressions upon us every moment of our life; also, the\\nmaterial objects with which we deal have become so saturated with social\\nvalues that each comes to us with a double significance, and what an\\nobject _means_ often stands for more than what it _is_. From the lives\\nof people with whom we daily mingle; from the wider circle whose lives\\ndo not immediately touch ours, but who are interpreted to us by the\\npress, by history and literature; from the social institutions into\\nwhich have gone the lives of millions, and of which our lives form a\\npart, there come to us constantly a flood of impressions whose influence\\ncannot be measured. So likewise with religious impressions. God is all\\nabout us and within us. He speaks to us from every nook and corner of\\nnature, and communes with us through the still small voice from within,\\nif we will but listen. The Bible, religious instruction, and the lives\\nof good people are other sources of religious impressions constantly\\ntending to mold our lives. The beautiful in nature, art, and human\\nconduct constantly appeals to us in æssthetic impressions.\\n\\nALL IMPRESSIONS LEAD TOWARD EXPRESSION.--Each of these groups of\\nimpressions may be subdivided and extended into an almost indefinite\\nnumber and variety, the different groups meeting and overlapping, it is\\ntrue, yet each preserving reasonably distinct characteristics. A common\\ncharacteristic of them all, as shown in the diagram, is that they all\\npoint toward expression. The varieties of light, color, form, and\\ndistance which we get through vision are not merely that we may know\\nthese phenomena of nature, but that, knowing them, we may use the\\nknowledge in making proper responses to our environment. Our power to\\nknow human sympathy and love through our social impressions are not\\nmerely that we may feel these emotions, but that, feeling them, we may\\nact in response to them.\\n\\nIt is impossible to classify logically in any simple scheme all the\\npossible forms of expression. The diagram will serve, however, to call\\nattention to some of the chief modes of bodily expression, and also to\\nthe results of the bodily expressions in the arts and vocations. Here\\nagain the process of subdivision and extension can be carried out\\nindefinitely. The laugh can be made to tell many different stories.\\nCrying may express bitter sorrow or uncontrollable joy. Vocal speech may\\nbe carried on in a thousand tongues. Dramatic action may be made to\\nportray the whole range of human feelings. Plays and games are wide\\nenough in their scope to satisfy the demands of all ages and every\\npeople. The handicrafts cover so wide a range that the material progress\\nof civilization can be classed under them, and indeed without their\\ndevelopment the arts and vocations would be impossible. Architecture,\\nsculpture, painting, music, and literature have a thousand possibilities\\nboth in technique and content. Likewise the modes of society, conduct,\\nand religion are unlimited in their forms of expression.\\n\\nLIMITATIONS OF EXPRESSION.--While it is more blessed to give than to\\nreceive, it is somewhat harder in the doing; for more of the self is,\\nafter all, involved in expression than in impression. Expression needs\\nto be cultivated as an art; for who can express all he thinks, or feels,\\nor conceives? Who can do his innermost self justice when he attempts to\\nexpress it in language, in music, or in marble? The painter answers when\\npraised for his work, \"If you could but see the picture I intended to\\npaint!\" The pupil says, \"I know, but I cannot tell.\" The friend says, \"I\\nwish I could tell you how sorry I am.\" The actor complains, \"If I could\\nonly portray the passion as I feel it, I could bring all the world to my\\nfeet!\" The body, being of grosser structure than the mind, must always\\nlag somewhat behind in expressing the mind\\'s states; yet, so perfect is\\nthe harmony between the two, that with a body well trained to respond to\\nthe mind\\'s needs, comparatively little of the spiritual need be lost in\\nits expression through the material.\\n\\n\\n2. THE PLACE OF EXPRESSION IN DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nNor are we to think that cultivation of expression results in better\\npower of expression alone, or that lack of cultivation results only in\\ndecreased power of expression.\\n\\nINTELLECTUAL VALUE OF EXPRESSION.--There is a distinct mental value in\\nexpression. An idea always assumes new clearness and wider relations\\nwhen it is expressed. Michael Angelo, making his plans for the great\\ncathedral, found his first concept of the structure expanding and\\ngrowing more beautiful as he developed his plans. The sculptor,\\nbeginning to model the statue after the image which he has in his mind,\\nfinds the image growing and becoming more expressive and beautiful as\\nthe clay is molded and formed. The writer finds the scope and worth of\\nhis book growing as he proceeds with the writing. The student, beginning\\ndoubtfully on his construction in geometry, finds the truth growing\\nclearer as he proceeds. The child with a dim and hazy notion of the\\nmeaning of the story in history or literature discovers that the meaning\\ngrows clear as he himself works out its expression in speech, in the\\nhandicrafts, or in dramatic representation.\\n\\nSo we may apply the test to any realm of thought whatever, and the law\\nholds good: _It is not in its apprehension, but in its expression, that\\na truth finally becomes assimilated to our body of usable knowledge._\\nAnd this means that in all training of the body through its motor\\nexpression we are to remember that the mind must be behind the act; that\\nthe intellect must guide the hand; that the object is not to make\\nskillful fingers alone, but to develop clear and intelligent thought as\\nwell.\\n\\nMORAL VALUE OF EXPRESSION.--Expression also has a distinct moral value.\\nThere are many more people of good intentions than of moral character in\\nthe world. The rugged proverb tells us that the road to hell is paved\\nwith good intentions. And how easy it is to form good resolutions. Who\\nof us has not, after some moral struggle, said, \"I will break the bonds\\nof this habit: I will enter upon that heroic line of action!\" and then,\\nsatisfied for the time with having made the resolution, continued in the\\nold path, until we were surprised later to find that we had never got\\nbeyond the resolution.\\n\\nIt is not in the moment of the resolve but in the moment when the\\nresolve is carried out in action that the moral value inheres. To take a\\nstand on a question of right and wrong means more than to show one\\'s\\nallegiance to the right--it clears one\\'s own moral vision and gives him\\ncommand of himself. Expression is, finally, the only true test for our\\nmorality. Lacking moral expression, we may stand in the class of those\\nwho are merely good, but we can never enter the class of those who are\\ngood for something. One cannot but wonder what would happen if all the\\npeople in the world who are morally right should give expression to\\ntheir moral sentiments, not in words alone, but in deeds. Surely the\\nmillennium would speedily come, not only among the nations, but in the\\nlives of men.\\n\\nRELIGIOUS VALUE OF EXPRESSION.--True religious experience demands\\nexpression. The older conception of a religious life was to escape from\\nthe world and live a life of communion and contemplation in some\\nsecluded spot, ignoring the world thirsting without. Later religious\\nteaching, however, recognized the fact that religion cannot consist in\\ndrinking in blessings alone, no matter how ecstatic the feeling which\\nmay accompany the process; that it is not the receiving, but this along\\nwith the giving that enriches the life. To give the cup of cold water,\\nto visit the widow and the fatherless, to comfort and help the needy and\\nforlorn--this is not only scriptural but it is psychological. Only as\\nreligious feeling goes out into religious expression, can we have a\\nnormal religious experience.\\n\\nSOCIAL VALUE OF EXPRESSION.--The criterion of an education once was, how\\nmuch does he know? The world did not expect an educated man to _do_\\nanything; he was to be put on a pedestal and admired from a distance.\\nBut this criterion is now obsolete. Society cares little how much we\\nknow if it does not enable us to do. People no longer admire mere\\nknowledge, but insist that the man of education shall put his shoulder\\nto the wheel and lend a hand wherever help is needed. Education is no\\nlonger to set men apart from their fellows, but to make them more\\nefficient comrades and helpers in the world\\'s work. Not the man who\\n_knows_ chemistry and botany, but he who can use this knowledge to make\\ntwo blades of grass grow where but one grew before, is the true\\nbenefactor of his race. In short, the world demands services returned\\nfor opportunities afforded; it expects social expression to result from\\neducation.\\n\\nAnd this is also best for the individual, for only through social\\nservice can we attain to a full realization of the social values in our\\nenvironment. Only thus can we enter fully into the social heritage of\\nthe ages which we receive from books and institutions; only thus can we\\ncome into the truest and best relations with humanity in a common\\nbrotherhood; only thus can we live the broader and more significant\\nlife, and come to realize the largest possible social self.\\n\\n\\n3. EDUCATIONAL USE OF EXPRESSION\\n\\nThe educational significance of the truths illustrated in the diagram\\nand the discussion has been somewhat slow in taking hold in our schools.\\nThis has been due not alone to the slowness of the educational world to\\ngrasp a new idea, but also to the practical difficulties connected with\\nadapting the school exercises as well to the expression side of\\neducation as to the impression. From the fall of Athens on down to the\\ntime of Froebel the schools were constituted on the theory that pupils\\nwere to _receive_ education; that they were to _drink in_ knowledge,\\nthat their minds were to be _stored_ with facts. Children were to \"be\\nseen and not heard.\" Education was largely a process of gorging the\\nmemory with information.\\n\\nEASIER TO PROVIDE FOR THE IMPRESSION SIDE OF EDUCATION.--Now it is\\nevident that it is far easier to provide for the passive side of\\neducation than for the active side. All that is needed in the former\\ncase is to have teachers and books reasonably full of information, and\\npupils sufficiently docile to receive it. But in the latter case, the\\nequipment must be more extensive. If the child is to be allowed to carry\\nout his impressions into action, if he is actually to _do_ something\\nhimself, then he must be supplied with adequate equipment.\\n\\nSo far as the home life was concerned, the child of several generations\\nago was at a decided advantage over the child of today on the expression\\nside of his education. The homes of that day were beehives of industry,\\nin which a dozen handicrafts were taught and practiced. The buildings,\\nthe farm implements, and most of the furniture of the home were made\\nfrom the native timber. The material for the clothing of the family was\\nproduced on the farm, made into cloth, and finally into garments in the\\nhome. Nearly all the supplies for the table came likewise from the farm.\\nThese industries demanded the combined efforts of the family, and each\\nchild did his or her part.\\n\\nBut that day is past. One-half of our people live in cities and towns,\\nand even in the village and on the farm the handicrafts of the home have\\nbeen relegated to the factory, and everything comes into the home ready\\nfor use. The telephone, the mail carrier, and the deliveryman do all the\\nerrands even, and the child in the home is deprived of responsibility\\nand of nearly all opportunity for manual expression. This is no one\\'s\\nfault, for it is just one phase of a great industrial readjustment in\\nsociety. Yet the fact remains that the home has lost an important\\nelement in education, which the school must supply if we are not to be\\nthe losers educationally by the change.\\n\\nTHE SCHOOL TO TAKE UP THE HANDICRAFTS.--And modern educational method is\\ninsisting precisely on this point. A few years ago the boy caught\\nwhittling in school was a fit subject for a flogging; the boy is today\\ngiven bench and tools, and is instructed in their use. Then the child\\nwas punished for drawing pictures; now we are using drawing as one of\\nthe best modes of expression. Then instruction in singing was intrusted\\nto an occasional evening class, which only the older children could\\nattend, and which was taught by some itinerant singing master; today we\\nmake music one of our most valuable school exercises. Then all play time\\nwas so much time wasted; now we recognize play as a necessary and\\nvaluable mode of expression and development. Then dramatic\\nrepresentation was confined to the occasional exhibition or evening\\nentertainment; now it has become a recognized part of our school work.\\nThen it was a crime for pupils to communicate with each other in school;\\nnow a part of the school work is planned so that pupils work in groups,\\nand thus receive social training. Then our schoolrooms were destitute of\\nevery vestige of beauty; today many of them are artistic and beautiful.\\n\\nThis statement of the case is rather over-optimistic if applied to our\\nwhole school system, however. For there are still many schools in which\\nall forms of handicraft are unknown, and in which the only training in\\nartistic expression is that which comes from caricaturing the teacher.\\nSinging is still an unknown art to many teachers. The play instinct is\\nyet looked upon with suspicion and distrust in some quarters. A large\\nnumber of our schoolrooms are as barren and ugly today as ever, and\\ncontain an atmosphere as stifling to all forms of natural expression. We\\ncan only comfort ourselves with Holmes\\'s maxim, that it matters not so\\nmuch where we stand as in what direction we are moving. And we certainly\\nare moving toward a larger development and greater efficiency in\\nexpression on the part of those who pass through our schools.\\n\\nEXPRESSION AND CHARACTER.--Finally, all that has been said in this\\ndiscussion has direct reference to what we call character--that\\nmysterious something which we so often hear eulogized and so seldom\\nanalyzed. Character has two distinct phases, which may be called the\\n_subjective_ phase and the _social_ phase; or, stating it differently,\\ncharacter is both what we _are_ and what we _do_. The first of these has\\nto do with the nature of the real, innermost self; and the last, with\\nthe modes in which this self finds expression. And it is fair to say\\nthat those about us are concerned with what we are chiefly from its\\nrelation to what we do.\\n\\nCharacter is not a thing, but a process; it is the succession of our\\nthoughts and acts from hour to hour. It is not something which we can\\nhoard and protect and polish unto a more perfect day, but it is the\\neveryday self in the process of living. And the only way in which it can\\nbe made or marred is through the nature of this stream of thoughts and\\nacts which constitute the day\\'s life--is through _being_ or _doing_ well\\nor ill.\\n\\nTWO LINES OF DEVELOPMENT.--The cultivation of character must, then,\\nignore neither of these two lines. To neglect the first is to forget\\nthat it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks; that\\na corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit; that the act is the true\\nindex of the soul. To omit the second is to leave the character half\\nformed, the will weak, and the life inefficient and barren of results.\\nThe mind must be supplied with noble ideas and high ideals, with right\\nemotions and worthy ambitions. On the other hand, the proper connection\\nmust be established between these mental states and appropriate acts.\\nAnd the acts must finally grow into habits, so that we naturally and\\ninevitably translate our ideas and ideals, our emotions and ambitions\\ninto deeds. Our character must be strong not in thought and feeling\\nalone, but also in the power to return to the world its finished\\nproduct in the form of service.\\n\\n\\n4. PROBLEMS IN INTROSPECTION AND OBSERVATION\\n\\n1. Do you find that you understand better some difficult point or\\nproblem after you have succeeded in stating it? Do you remember better\\nwhat you have expressed?\\n\\n2. In which particular ones of your studies do you think you could have\\ndone better if you had been given more opportunity for expression?\\nExplain the psychology of the maxim, we learn to do by doing.\\n\\n3. Observe various schools at work for the purpose of determining\\nwhether opportunities for expression in the recitations are adequate.\\nHave you ever seen a class when listless from listening liven up when\\nthey were given something to _do_ themselves?\\n\\n4. Make a study of the types of laughter you hear. Why is some laughter\\nmuch more pleasant than other laughter? What did a noted sculptor mean\\nwhen he said that a smile at the eyes cannot be depended upon as can one\\nat the mouth?\\n\\n5. What examples have you observed in children\\'s plays showing their\\nlove for dramatic representation? What handicrafts are the most suitable\\nfor children of primary grades? for the grammar school? for the high\\nschool?\\n\\n6. Do you number those among your acquaintance who seem bright enough,\\nso far as learning is concerned, but who cannot get anything\\naccomplished? Is the trouble on the expression side of their character?\\nWhat are you doing about your own powers of expression? Are you seeking\\nto cultivate expression in new lines? Is there danger in attempting too\\nmany lines?\\n\\n\\n\\nINDEX\\n\\nAction, automatic, 275\\n  classes of, 273\\n  factors involved in, 59\\n  reflex, 274\\n  volitional, 276\\n\\nActivity,

FOR TEACHERS\\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE\\n\\nBy PAUL KLAPPER, Ph.D., Department of Education, College of the City of\\nNew York. 8vo, Cloth, $1.75.\\n\\nThis book studies the basic principles underlying sound and progressive\\npedagogy. In its scope and organization it aims to give (1) a\\ncomprehensive and systematic analysis of the principles of education,\\n(2) the modern trend and interpretation of educational thought, (3) a\\ntransition from pure psychology to methods of teaching and discipline,\\nand (4) practical applications of educational theory to the problems\\nthat confront the teacher in the course of daily routine. Every\\npractical pedagogical solution that is offered has actually stood the\\ntest of classroom demonstration.\\n\\nThe book opens with a study of the function of education and a contrast\\nof the modern social conception with those aims which have been guiding\\nideals in previous educational systems. Part II deals with the\\nphysiological aspects of education. Part III is taken up with the\\nproblem of socializing the child through the curriculum and the school\\ndiscipline. The last part of the book, Part IV, The Mental Aspect of\\nEducation, is developed under the following sections: _Section A._ The\\nInstinctive Aspect of Mind. Mind and its development through\\nself-expression. Self-activity. Instincts. _Section B._ Intellectual\\nAspect of Mind. The functions of Intellect, Perception, Apperception,\\nMemory, Imagination, Thought Activities. The Doctrine of Formal\\nDiscipline and its influence upon educational endeavor. _Section C._\\nEmotional Aspect of Mind. _Section D._ Volitional Aspect of Mind. Study\\nof will, kinds of volitional action, habit vs. deliberative\\nconsciousness. The Education of the Will. Education and Social\\nResponsibility, the problems of ethical instruction, and the social\\nfunctions of the School.\\n\\nIn order to increase the usefulness of the book to teachers of education\\nthere is added a classified bibliography for systematic, intensive\\nreference reading and a list of suggested problems suitable for advanced\\nwork.\\n\\nD.

Growing out of his\\nwork as a teacher and lecturer, this book combines the practical\\npedagogy of a teacher with the scholarship of an undisputed authority on\\neducation and its study. There is no book in this field containing such\\na fund of useful material arranged along such a skillful outline. An\\nexperience of years is here condensed and solidified into a splendid\\nunit.\\n\\n\"A Student\\'s Text-Book in the History of Education\" presents an\\nauthentic account of every educational system which has influenced our\\npresent-day scheme of pedagogy from the times of the Hebrews to the Age\\nof the Montessori method. No time is wasted on detailed considerations\\nof other systems. Professor Duggan\\'s book aids the teacher by giving him\\na better understanding of present-day problems in education; by\\nexplaining how Western Civilization developed the educational ideals,\\ncontent, organization, and practices which characterize it today; and by\\ndeveloping the manner in which each people has worked out the solution\\nof the great problem of reconciling individual liberty with social\\nstability.\\n\\nD.

D.\\n_Professor of Education, The State University of Iowa,\\nIowa City, Iowa_.\\n\\n12mo., Cloth, $1.50 net\\n\\nWritten not so much for the educational specialist as for the practical\\nneeds of busy teachers, \"Education For Social Efficiency\" presents\\nthrough the medium of illustration, a social view of education which is\\nvery prominent. It shows concretely various ways in which parents as\\nwell as teachers may contribute something towards the realization of the\\nideal of social efficiency as the goal of our educational enterprise.\\n\\nThe idea that the school, especially the country school, should provide\\nmore than instruction in lessons for the scholars is Professor King\\'s\\nmain point. Excellent chapters are included on The School as a Social\\nCenter, The School and Social Progress, and the Social Aim of Education.\\nIn discussing the rural schools particularly, the author writes on The\\nRural School and the Rural Community, Adapting the Country School to\\nCountry Needs, and an especially valuable chapter on The Consolidated\\nSchool and Socially Efficient Education for the Country.\\n\\nThe response with which Professor King\\'s \"Education for Social\\nEfficiency\" has met throughout the country is evidenced by the fact that\\nthe States of Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Virginia have\\nadopted it for reading circle use. It has also been adopted by the\\nNational Bureau of Education for use in its Rural Teachers\\' Reading\\nCircles.\\n\\nD.

His parents were very hard-working\\nand deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\\nchildren in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\\nin reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\\ncharacter.\\n\\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\\nfinal examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\\nalready begun his first work, “Poor Folk.”\\n\\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\\nwas received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\\ninstantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\\nseemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\\nwas arrested.\\n\\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\\nwas one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\\nand Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in conversations against\\nthe censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\\nknowing of the intention to set up a printing press.” Under Nicholas\\nI. (that “stern and just man,” as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\\nenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment\\nhe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\\nbe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: “They snapped\\nwords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\\nto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\\na few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\\nI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\\nbid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\\nbrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\\nus our lives.” The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\\n\\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\\nnever regained his sanity.\\n\\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\\nDostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\\naccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\\nin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\\nHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\\ncruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\\nhe began the “Dead House,” and some years of service in a disciplinary\\nbattalion.\\n\\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\\nand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\\nsuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\\na year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\\nallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--“Vremya,” which was\\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\\nhis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\\nhe took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started\\nanother journal--“The Epoch,” which within a few months was also\\nprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was\\ndependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\\nsaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\\nmuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\\n\\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\\nmonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\\ndemonstrations of love and honour.\\n\\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\\nvast multitude of mourners, who “gave the hapless man the funeral of a\\nking.” He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\\n\\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\\ninspired by Dostoevsky: “He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and\\nour bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than\\nwe have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart\\nwhich we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other\\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he\\nbecame great.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART I\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\\nthe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\\nin hesitation, towards K. bridge.\\n\\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\\ngarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\\nlike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\\ndinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\\nhe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\\nsick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\\nhopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\\n\\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\\nfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\\nverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\\nhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\\nonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\\nanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\\ngiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\\nfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\\ntrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\\nlie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\\nslip out unseen.\\n\\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\\naware of his fears.\\n\\n“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\\ntrifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s\\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would\\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\\ntoo much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this\\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse\\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\\n\\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already\\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\\ndisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,\\nby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\\nof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\\nto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\\nmoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\\nfood.\\n\\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\\nhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\\nof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\\ncreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\\nof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\\nand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\\nheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\\nthat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\\nsuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,\\nin spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\\nof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\\nacquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\\nmeeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\\nreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\\ndray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German\\nhatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\\nman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\\nround hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\\ntorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\\nfashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\\nhad overtaken him.\\n\\n“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst\\nof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\\nspoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\\nand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\\nsort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\\na hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\\nmatters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\\na clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\\npossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such\\ntrifles that always ruin everything....”\\n\\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\\nof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\\nthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\\nfaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\\nbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\\nthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\\nhis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\\nthis “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\\nstill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\\n“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\\nand more violent.\\n\\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\\nwhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\\nworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\\nsorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\\nThere was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\\ntwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\\nthe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\\nat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\\nstaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\\nin such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\\n\\n“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\\nI were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he\\nreached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\\nwho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\\nflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\\nfamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\\nstaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a good\\nthing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\\nwoman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\\ntin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\\nthat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\\nits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\\nclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\\nby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\\nwoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\\nnothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\\nBut, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\\nopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\\nwas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\\nhim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\\nwithered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\\nlittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\\nwith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\\nwhich looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\\nand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\\nfur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\\ninstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\\nexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\\n\\n“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made\\nhaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\\npolite.\\n\\n“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the\\nold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\\n\\n“And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a\\nlittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhaps\\nshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\\ntime,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.\\n\\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\\nand pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\\nin front of her:\\n\\n“Step in, my good sir.”\\n\\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\\nthe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\\nlighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\\n\\n“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by\\nchance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\\neverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\\nremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\\nfurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\\na huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\\ndressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\\nframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\\nall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\\nwas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\\neverything shone.\\n\\n“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\\nto be seen in the whole flat.\\n\\n“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\\ncleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\\nat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\\nwhich stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\\nhad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\\n\\n“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room\\nand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\\nthe face.\\n\\n“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket\\nan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\\nglobe; the chain was of steel.\\n\\n“But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\\nbefore yesterday.”\\n\\n“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”\\n\\n“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\\nyour pledge at once.”\\n\\n“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”\\n\\n“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.\\nI gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\\nquite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”\\n\\n“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I\\nshall be getting some money soon.”\\n\\n“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”\\n\\n“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.\\n\\n“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\\nyoung man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\\naway; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\\nelse he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\\n\\n“Hand it over,” he said roughly.\\n\\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\\nthe curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\\nthe middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\\nher unlocking the chest of drawers.\\n\\n“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected. “So she carries the keys in\\na pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’s\\none key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\\nthat can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\\nother chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\\nhave keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”\\n\\nThe old woman came back.\\n\\n“Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take\\nfifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But\\nfor the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\\non the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\\naltogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the\\nwatch. Here it is.”\\n\\n“What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”\\n\\n“Just so.”\\n\\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the\\nold woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still\\nsomething he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know\\nwhat.\\n\\n“I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona\\nIvanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it\\nback from a friend...” he broke off in confusion.\\n\\n“Well, we will talk about it then, sir.”\\n\\n“Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with\\nyou?” He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the\\npassage.\\n\\n“What business is she of yours, my good sir?”\\n\\n“Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,\\nAlyona Ivanovna.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more\\nand more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two\\nor three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was\\nin the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and\\ncan I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he added\\nresolutely. “And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?\\nWhat filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,\\ndisgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”\\n But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling\\nof intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart\\nwhile he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a\\npitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to\\ndo with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the\\npavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling\\nagainst them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next\\nstreet. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern\\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.\\nAt that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and\\nsupporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to\\nthink, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had\\nnever been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a\\nburning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his\\nsudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little\\ntable in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank\\noff the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became\\nclear.\\n\\n“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it\\nall to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of\\nbeer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,\\nthe mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all\\nis!”\\n\\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful\\nas though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed\\nround in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that\\nmoment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also\\nnot normal.\\n\\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken\\nmen he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and\\na girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure\\nleft the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\\nwere a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,\\nsitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with\\na grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had\\ndropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in\\nhis sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper\\npart of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some\\nmeaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:\\n\\n   “His wife a year he fondly loved\\n    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved.”\\n\\nOr suddenly waking up again:\\n\\n   “Walking along the crowded row\\n    He met the one he used to know.”\\n\\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with\\npositive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was\\nanother man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government\\nclerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and\\nlooking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nRaskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided\\nsociety of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he\\nfelt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\\nplace within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\\nwas so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\\nexcitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other\\nworld, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the\\nsurroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.\\n\\nThe master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently\\ncame down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\\nred turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his\\nperson. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,\\nwith no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\\niron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\\nanother boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\\ncounter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\\nsome fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\\nclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\\nan atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\\n\\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the\\nfirst moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on\\nRaskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked\\nlike a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\\nafterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\\nat the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\\npersistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\\nthe other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\\nlooked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\\na shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\\nconverse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\\nand stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\\na yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\\nreddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\\nfeeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\\nsame time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\\nold and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\\nexcept one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\\nand stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\\nno beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\\nlooked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\\nand like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\\nruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky\\ntable. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and\\nresolutely:\\n\\n“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?\\nForasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my\\nexperience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not\\naccustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in\\nconjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular\\ncounsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I\\nmake bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”\\n\\n“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at\\nthe grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly\\naddressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for\\ncompany of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his\\nhabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached\\nor attempted to approach him.\\n\\n“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk. “Just what\\nI thought! I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he\\ntapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. “You’ve been a\\nstudent or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....”\\n He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside\\nthe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke\\nfluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his\\nsentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as\\ngreedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.\\n\\n“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,\\nthat’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,\\nand that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a\\nvice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but\\nin beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human\\nsociety with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\\nhumiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary\\nI am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!\\nHonoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and\\nmy wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me\\nto ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent\\na night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”\\n\\n“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept\\nso....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in\\nfact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\\nprobable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\\nHis hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\\nnails.\\n\\nHis conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The\\nboys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the\\nupper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”\\n and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.\\nEvidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most\\nlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of\\nfrequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in\\nthe tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and\\nespecially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order\\nat home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify\\nthemselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\\n\\n“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper. “And why don’t you work, why\\naren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”\\n\\n“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressing\\nhimself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put\\nthat question to him. “Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache\\nto think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov\\nbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?\\nExcuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to\\npetition hopelessly for a loan?”\\n\\n“Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?”\\n\\n“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you\\nwill get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive\\ncertainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will\\non no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?\\nFor he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? But\\nMr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day\\nthat compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s\\nwhat is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I\\nask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that\\nhe won’t, I set off to him and...”\\n\\n“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must\\nhave somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must\\ngo somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,\\nthen I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added\\nin parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.\\n“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparent\\ncomposure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the\\ninnkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of\\ntheir heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all\\nthat is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but\\nwith humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, young\\nman, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not\\n_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”\\n\\nThe young man did not answer a word.\\n\\n“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,\\nafter waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. “Well, so be\\nit, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but\\nKaterina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s\\ndaughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a\\nnoble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,\\nif only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man\\nought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina\\nIvanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although\\nI realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for\\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he\\ndeclared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my\\nGod, if she would but once.... But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no\\nuse talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true\\nand more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a\\nbeast by nature!”\\n\\n“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist\\nresolutely on the table.\\n\\n“Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very\\nstockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the\\norder of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!\\nHer mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own\\nproperty, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this\\nwinter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three\\nlittle children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\\nnight; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s\\nbeen used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has\\na tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it?\\nAnd the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try\\nto find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\\ntwice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on the\\ntable.\\n\\n“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to\\nread some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why\\nI addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I\\ndo not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,\\nwho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man\\nof feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a\\nhigh-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she\\ndanced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for\\nwhich she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.\\nThe medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the\\ncertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed\\nit to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms\\nwith the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past\\nhonours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for\\nit, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of\\nthe past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady\\nof spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has\\nnothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated\\nwith disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s\\nrudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to\\nher bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was\\na widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the\\nother. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and\\nran away with him from her father’s house. She was exceedingly fond of\\nher husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he\\ndied. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of\\nwhich I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of\\nhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad\\nthat, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having\\nonce been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in\\na wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she\\nwas left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups\\nand downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her\\nrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively\\nproud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a\\nwidower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered\\nher my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can\\njudge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education\\nand culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my\\nwife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she\\nmarried me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you\\nunderstand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,\\nthat you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed\\nmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he\\ntapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, I\\ncould not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no\\nfault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch\\nit!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at\\nlast after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent\\ncapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a\\nsituation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This\\ntime it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come\\nout.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;\\nand what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.\\nThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and\\ndisorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by\\nmy first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with\\nfrom her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For,\\nthough Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\\nlady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it’s no use going over\\nthat! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an\\neffort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal\\nhistory, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we\\nhad no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not\\neven those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at\\nCyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read\\nother books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great\\ninterest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--do\\nyou know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the\\nwhole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured\\nsir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that\\na respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen\\nfarthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special\\ntalent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’s\\nmore, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of\\nhim?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she\\nmade him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the\\npretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were\\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina\\nIvanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed\\nred, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says\\nshe, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’\\nAnd much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the\\nlittle ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of\\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle\\ncreature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin\\nlittle face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing\\nlike that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very\\nwell known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her\\nthrough the landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\\n‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame\\nher, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herself\\nwhen she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\\nof the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\\nelse.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children\\ncry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o’clock\\nI saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the\\nroom and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up to\\nKaterina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her\\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\\nsimply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\\nmade of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\\non the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\\nbody kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\\nAnd then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\\ngo up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\\nkissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\\nasleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\\ndrunk.”\\n\\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he\\nhurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.\\n\\n“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owing\\nto an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by\\nevil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a\\nleading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of\\nrespect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take\\na yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with\\nus. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\\nshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\\nhm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s\\naccount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of\\na sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated\\nman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina\\nIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s\\nhow it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\\nat the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is\\na lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft\\npalates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one\\nroom, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor\\npeople and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,\\nand put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his\\nexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you\\nknow him? No? Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax...\\nwax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were\\ndim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once already you have\\ndeceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my own\\nresponsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you\\ncan go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality\\nhe would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of\\nmodern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I\\nannounced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive a\\nsalary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”\\n\\nMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole\\nparty of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds\\nof a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven\\nsinging “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry. The room was filled with\\nnoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.\\nMarmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.\\nHe appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more\\ndrunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his\\nrecent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was\\npositively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov\\nlistened attentively.\\n\\n“That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\\nand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\\nkingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but\\nabuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon\\nZaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’\\nThey made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They\\nbegan to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed\\nto get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty\\ncopecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,\\na uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and\\na half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina\\nIvanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with\\nhorse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any\\ndresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going\\non a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened\\nherself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a\\nclean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different\\nperson, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,\\nhad only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me\\nto come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do\\nyou hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you\\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with\\nour landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not\\nresist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,\\nwhispering together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,\\nnow, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his\\nexcellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the\\nothers wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into\\nhis study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon\\nZaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite\\nof your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and\\nsince moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you\\nhear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And\\nall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not\\nsimply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it\\nall herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she\\ndoes! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!... Six days\\nago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles\\nforty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,\\n‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?\\nYou would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a\\nhusband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’\\nsaid she.”\\n\\nMarmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began\\nto twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded\\nappearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of\\nspirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered\\nhis listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.\\nHe felt vexed that he had come here.\\n\\n“Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself--“Oh,\\nsir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to\\nothers, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the\\ntrivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.\\nFor I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life\\nand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would\\narrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should\\ngive her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour\\nand restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....\\nQuite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort\\nof start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on\\nthe very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five\\ndays ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,\\nI stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was\\nleft of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look\\nat me, all of you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are\\nlooking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform\\nis lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the\\ngarments I have on... and it’s the end of everything!”\\n\\nMarmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed\\nhis eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute\\nlater his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and\\naffectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\\n\\n“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!\\nHe-he-he!”\\n\\n“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he\\nshouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\\n\\n“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,\\naddressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gave\\nme with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said\\nnothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up\\nyonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,\\nthey don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t\\nblame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do\\nyou think, my dear sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It\\ncosts money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you\\nunderstand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;\\npetticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her\\nfoot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you\\nunderstand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,\\nhere I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking\\nit! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like\\nme, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry\\nor not? He-he-he!”\\n\\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was\\nempty.\\n\\n“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again\\nnear them.\\n\\nShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths\\ncame from those who were listening and also from those who had heard\\nnothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged\\ngovernment clerk.\\n\\n“To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,\\nstanding up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only\\nwaiting for that question.\\n\\n“Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! I\\nought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,\\noh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be\\ncrucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...\\nDo you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been\\nsweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and\\ntribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity\\nus Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all\\nthings, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day\\nand He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,\\nconsumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is\\nthe daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,\\nundismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I have\\nalready forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins\\nwhich are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he\\nwill forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my\\nheart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive\\nall, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has\\ndone with all of them, then He will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’\\nHe will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come\\nforth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame\\nand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made\\nin the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the\\nwise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou\\nreceive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye\\nwise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one\\nof them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His\\nhands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...\\nand we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and\\nall will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....\\nLord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and\\nhelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings\\nand plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;\\nthere was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard\\nagain.\\n\\n“That’s his notion!”\\n\\n“Talked himself silly!”\\n\\n“A fine clerk he is!”\\n\\nAnd so on, and so on.\\n\\n“Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and\\naddressing Raskolnikov--“come along with me... Kozel’s house, looking\\ninto the yard. I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to\\nhelp him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech\\nand leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred\\npaces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and\\nconfusion as they drew nearer the house.\\n\\n“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in\\nagitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair\\nmatter! Bother my hair! That’s what I say! Indeed it will be better if\\nshe does begin pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s her\\neyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,\\nfrightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people\\nin that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of\\nthe children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...\\nI don’t know what’s happened! I don’t know! But blows I am not afraid\\nof.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an\\nenjoyment. In fact I can’t get on without it.... It’s better so. Let\\nher strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so... There is the\\nhouse. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.\\nLead the way!”\\n\\nThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase\\ngot darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o’clock\\nand although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was\\nquite dark at the top of the stairs.\\n\\nA grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very\\npoor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;\\nthe whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,\\nlittered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments.\\nAcross the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it\\nprobably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs\\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which\\nstood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge\\nof the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It\\nappeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,\\nbut their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other\\nrooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was\\ndivided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter\\nwithin. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words\\nof the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\\n\\nRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,\\nslim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown\\nhair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down\\nin her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips\\nwere parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes\\nglittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And\\nthat consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the\\ncandle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to\\nRaskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for\\nMarmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.\\nShe seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room\\nwas close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the\\nstaircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner\\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not\\nclose the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\\ncurled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older\\nstood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a\\nbeating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,\\nwearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung\\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.\\nHer arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck. She was\\ntrying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she\\ncould to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large\\ndark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened\\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the\\ndoor, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov\\nin front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently\\nfacing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what\\nhe had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into\\nthe next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no\\nfurther notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it\\nand uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the\\ndoorway.\\n\\n“Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back! The criminal! the\\nmonster!... And where is the money? What’s in your pocket, show me! And\\nyour clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the\\nmoney! Speak!”\\n\\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently\\nheld up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.\\n\\n“Where is the money?” she cried--“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?\\nThere were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a fury\\nshe seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov\\nseconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.\\n\\n“And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a\\npositive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and\\nfro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.\\nThe child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the\\ncorner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed\\nto his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was\\nshaking like a leaf.\\n\\n“He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed in\\ndespair--“and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!”--and\\nwringing her hands she pointed to the children. “Oh, accursed life!\\nAnd you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once upon\\nRaskolnikov--“from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have\\nbeen drinking with him, too! Go away!”\\n\\nThe young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door\\nwas thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse\\nlaughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust\\nthemselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in\\ndressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of\\nthem with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when\\nMarmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation\\nto him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill\\noutcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her\\nway amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and\\nfor the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her\\nwith coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,\\nRaskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the\\ncoppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to\\nlay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed\\nhis mind and would have gone back.\\n\\n“What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Sonia\\nand I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible to\\ntake it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he\\ndismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.\\n“Sonia wants pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and he\\nlaughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia\\nherself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting\\nbig game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust\\nto-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug\\nthere! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most\\nof it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to\\neverything, the scoundrel!”\\n\\nHe sank into thought.\\n\\n“And what if I am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought.\\n“What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the\\nwhole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial\\nterrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nHe waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not\\nrefreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked\\nwith hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six\\npaces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty\\nyellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man\\nof more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment\\nthat he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in\\nkeeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a\\npainted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;\\nthe dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long\\nuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and\\nhalf the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but\\nwas now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep\\non it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old\\nstudent’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he\\nheaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A\\nlittle table stood in front of the sofa.\\n\\nIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to\\nRaskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.\\nHe had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,\\nand even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked\\nsometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was\\nin the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated\\nupon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending\\nhim in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,\\nthough he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,\\nwas rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up\\nsweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into\\nhis room with a broom. She waked him up that day.\\n\\n“Get up, why are you asleep?” she called to him. “It’s past nine, I have\\nbrought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you’re fairly\\nstarving?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.\\n\\n“From the landlady, eh?” he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting\\nup on the sofa.\\n\\n“From the landlady, indeed!”\\n\\nShe set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and\\nlaid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.\\n\\n“Here, Nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (for\\nhe had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“run\\nand buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the\\npork-butcher’s.”\\n\\n“The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you rather have\\nsome cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s capital soup, yesterday’s. I\\nsaved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It’s fine soup.”\\n\\nWhen the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya\\nsat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country\\npeasant-woman and a very talkative one.\\n\\n“Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,” she\\nsaid.\\n\\nHe scowled.\\n\\n“To the police? What does she want?”\\n\\n“You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the room. That’s what\\nshe wants, to be sure.”\\n\\n“The devil, that’s the last straw,” he muttered, grinding his teeth,\\n“no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool,” he added aloud.\\n“I’ll go and talk to her to-day.”\\n\\n“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so\\nclever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One\\ntime you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you\\ndo nothing now?”\\n\\n“I am doing...” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.\\n\\n“What are you doing?”\\n\\n“Work...”\\n\\n“What sort of work?”\\n\\n“I am thinking,” he answered seriously after a pause.\\n\\nNastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter\\nand when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and\\nshaking all over till she felt ill.\\n\\n“And have you made much money by your thinking?” she managed to\\narticulate at last.\\n\\n“One can’t go out to give lessons without boots. And I’m sick of it.”\\n\\n“Don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.”\\n\\n“They pay so little for lessons. What’s the use of a few coppers?” he\\nanswered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.\\n\\n“And you want to get a fortune all at once?”\\n\\nHe looked at her strangely.\\n\\n“Yes, I want a fortune,” he answered firmly, after a brief pause.\\n\\n“Don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the\\nloaf or not?”\\n\\n“As you please.”\\n\\n“Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.”\\n\\n“A letter? for me! from whom?”\\n\\n“I can’t say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will\\nyou pay me back?”\\n\\n“Then bring it to me, for God’s sake, bring it,” cried Raskolnikov\\ngreatly excited--“good God!”\\n\\nA minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,\\nfrom the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a\\nlong while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also\\nsuddenly stabbed his heart.\\n\\n“Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are your three\\ncopecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and go!”\\n\\nThe letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her\\npresence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya\\nhad gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he\\ngazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear\\nand familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.\\nHe delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;\\nit was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets\\nof note paper were covered with very small handwriting.\\n\\n“My dear Rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since I last had a\\ntalk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me\\nawake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my\\ninevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look\\nto, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a\\ngrief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university\\nsome months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had\\nlost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my\\nhundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent\\nyou four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,\\nfrom Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a\\nkind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too. But having given\\nhim the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was\\npaid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send\\nyou anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall\\nbe able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate\\nourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In\\nthe first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister\\nhas been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be\\nseparated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will\\ntell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything\\nhas happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you\\nwrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great\\ndeal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote that\\nand asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to\\nyou? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have\\nthrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all\\nthe way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not\\nlet your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I\\ndo? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What\\nmade it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles\\nin advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on\\ncondition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it\\nwas impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.\\nThis sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\\nchiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\\nthen and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,\\nwriting that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not\\nso, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have\\nsuddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves\\nyou and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated\\nher very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at\\ntable.... But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as\\nnot to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite\\nof the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s\\nwife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\\nespecially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental\\nhabits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\\nwas all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\\nconceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\\nit under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\\nhorrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\\nhis being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\\nAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\\nthe truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\\nto make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\\ninducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\\nto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\\nthrough! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\\naccount of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\\nPetrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\\nwould have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\\nhave meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\\ninevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\\nnot hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\\nDounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\\nhas. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\\nshe has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\\nto me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\\nconstantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\\nPetrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\\ngarden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\\nthe blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\\nscene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\\nwent so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\\nshouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\\nbe packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they\\nflung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\\nfolding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\\nand Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\\ncould I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\\nwhat could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\\nyou the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\\nand indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\\nyourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\\nwith trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\\nwhole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\\nto such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\\nof the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\\nus. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\\nstreet, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\\ninsult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\\nso that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\\ngoing by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\\nher in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\\nmonth she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\\nrather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\\nparticularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\\nat all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\\nthe town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\\nDounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how\\nshe endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is\\nan angel! But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.\\nSvidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably\\nfeeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and\\nunmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia\\nhad been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\\ncame upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\\nSvidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\\npersonal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\\nher. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\\nfor the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\\nhim that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\\ninfamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,\\nunhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\\nread it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\\ncleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\\nthan Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\\nwith servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again\\ncrushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\\nDounia’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\\nto the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\\nher strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\\ncame straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\\nbitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\\nforgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\\nthe houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\\nthe most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of\\nher feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\\neveryone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and\\neven allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\\nsuperfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\\nthe whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\\nhaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\\nthat in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\\nknew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\\nletter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\\nof it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\\nown houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a very\\ngreat deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s\\ncharacter. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s\\nreputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\\ndisgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\\nbegan to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\\nharshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\\nbut she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\\nrespect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\\nthat Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\\nhim. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\\narranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\\nwith me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\\ncould not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\\ncould not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\\nwas how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\\nPetrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\\nhas been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\\nexpressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\\nproperly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\\nus a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\\nspeedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\\nto get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\\nof course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\\nand unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\\nwell-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\\nand has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\\nold, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\\npresentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\\nBut possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\\nAnd beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\\ndo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\\nwarning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\\nupon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\\ndeliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\\nwhich are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\\nPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\\nAt his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\\nstill he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our\\nmost rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\\nsaid a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\\nlistened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\\nlittle of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\\nof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\\nyour sister’s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\\ngenerous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\\nOf course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\\nDounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\\nit her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\\nhappiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\\nmust be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\\nis a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\\nhis own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\\nhim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\\ncertain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\\nthe happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\\nrelies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\\nthat she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\\nrelationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\\nfor instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\\nfrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\\ninstance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,\\nin the course of conversation, he declared that before making\\nDounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\\ngood reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\\npoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\\nwife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\\nbenefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\\nthan I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\\nremember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\\nbut slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\\nto correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\\nme as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\\nvexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is\\nperfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\\nher mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\\nwalking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\\nthe ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\\nthat she had decided.\\n\\n“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\\nPetersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\\na legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\\nand commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\\ncase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\\nthe Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\\nevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\\nyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\\nyour future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\\npass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\\nprovidential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\\nventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\\nHe was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\\nget on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\\na relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\\nduties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\\nhe expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\\nyou time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\\nDounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\\nfor the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\\nyour becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\\nPetrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\\nstudent of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\\nall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\\nrealising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, very\\nnatural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\\npersuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\\nfuture husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\\nnot to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\\nespecially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\\ntake this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\\nhas either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\\nof his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\\nof it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\\nlater on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\\nhimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\\nyou may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\\nreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\\nown work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\\nwith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\\nis, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\\nyou first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\\nyou, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\\nhim close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\\nRodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\\nPetrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\\nfancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\\nthem, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\\ndelicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\\nfor the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\\nsimply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\\nnoticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with\\ntheir mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s\\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\\nlong as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\\nDounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\\njoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\\nknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\\nvery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\\nalmost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\\nset off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,\\npossibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\\nknow when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\\nown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\\neven before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\\ntoo soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\\npress you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\\nof seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\\nPyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\\nanything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\\nso much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\\na few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\\nherself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\\nalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\\nmoney as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\\nis to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know\\nthat Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles\\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\\nyou twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\\nuneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\\nbeen so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\\nis to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\\ntrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we\\nmust reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\\ncan’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\\nwe have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\\nthat the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\\nus to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\\nknow, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\\nquite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\\nto you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\\ntwo sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\\nhistory, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,\\nI embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia\\nyour sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she\\nloves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,\\nRodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If\\nonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,\\nRodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am\\nafraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of\\ninfidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,\\ndear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used\\nto lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those\\ndays. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with\\nmany kisses.\\n\\n“Yours till death,\\n\\n“PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.”\\n\\n\\nAlmost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov’s face was\\nwet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted\\nand a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his\\nhead down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long\\ntime. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.\\nAt last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was\\nlike a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He\\ntook up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting\\nanyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the\\nVassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though\\nhastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without\\nnoticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the\\nastonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nHis mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief\\nfact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he was\\nreading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably\\nsettled, in his mind: “Never such a marriage while I am alive and\\nMr. Luzhin be damned!” “The thing is perfectly clear,” he muttered\\nto himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his\\ndecision. “No, mother, no, Dounia, you won’t deceive me! and then they\\napologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without\\nme! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can’t be broken\\noff; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:\\n‘Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in\\npost-haste, almost by express.’ No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what\\nyou want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when\\nyou walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before\\nthe Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom. Bitter is\\nthe ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have\\ndetermined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one\\nwho has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much\\nmore solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who\\nshares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and\\nwho _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats\\neverything! And that very Dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marrying\\nhim! Splendid! splendid!\\n\\n“... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘our\\nmost rising generation’? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea\\nof prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!\\nI should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one\\nanother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into\\n_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart\\nand in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and\\nbetter not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from\\nmother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and\\nmother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was\\nsure to be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so! Who\\nwould not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions\\nand when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why\\ndoes she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than\\nherself’? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter\\nto her son? ‘You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.’ Oh,\\nmother!”\\n\\nHis bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to\\nmeet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.\\n\\n“Hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that\\nchased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and care\\nto get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The\\nchief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that was\\nsomething, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,\\nno doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a\\npeasant’s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in\\nit). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel very\\ncomfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One\\nmust cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr.\\nLuzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has\\nto raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it’s a matter\\nof business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and\\nexpenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The\\nbusiness man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less\\nthan their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they\\ndon’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see? And\\nthey are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first\\nblossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really\\nmatters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_\\nof the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it’s a\\nforetaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will\\nshe have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or\\ntwo ‘paper ones’ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does\\nshe expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons\\nalready for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the\\nmarriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let\\nslip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: ‘I\\nshall refuse,’ says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting\\non what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when\\nAfanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and\\nembroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don’t add\\nmore than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know\\nthat. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin’s\\ngenerosity; ‘he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.’\\nYou may wait a long time for that! That’s how it always is with these\\nSchilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan\\nwith them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see\\nnothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of\\nthe picture, yet they won’t face the truth till they are forced to; the\\nvery thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with\\nboth hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’s\\ncap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin\\nhas any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and\\nthat he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.\\nHe will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confound\\nhim!\\n\\n“Well,... mother I don’t wonder at, it’s like her, God bless her, but\\nhow could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were\\nnearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes\\nthat ‘Dounia can put up with a great deal.’ I know that very well. I\\nknew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half\\nyears I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that ‘Dounia\\ncan put up with a great deal.’ If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov\\nand all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And\\nnow mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up\\nwith Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of\\nwives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband’s\\nbounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Granted\\nthat he ‘let it slip,’ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it\\nwas not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as\\npossible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but\\nshe will have to live with the man. Why! she’d live on black bread\\nand water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral\\nfreedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,\\nmuch less Mr. Luzhin’s money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew\\nher and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there’s no denying,\\nthe Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! It’s a bitter thing to spend one’s\\nlife a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know\\nshe would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German\\nmaster than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself\\nfor ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has\\nnothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of\\nunalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to\\nbecome his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What’s the\\npoint of it? What’s the answer? It’s clear enough: for herself, for her\\ncomfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone\\nelse she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will\\nsell herself! That’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her\\nmother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,\\n‘we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,’ freedom, peace, conscience\\neven, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only my\\ndear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learn\\nto be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can\\npersuade ourselves that it is one’s duty for a good object. That’s just\\nlike us, it’s as clear as daylight. It’s clear that Rodion Romanovitch\\nRaskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,\\nyes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him\\na partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may\\neven be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his\\nlife a famous man! But my mother? It’s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her\\nfirst born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,\\nloving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even\\nfrom Sonia’s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long\\nas the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both\\nof you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in\\nit? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life with\\nMr. Luzhin. ‘There can be no question of love,’ mother writes. And what\\nif there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,\\ncontempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to ‘keep up your\\nappearance,’ too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness\\nmeans? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same\\nthing as Sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,\\nDounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it’s\\nsimply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be\\npaid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it’s more than you can\\nbear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the\\ncurses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa\\nPetrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,\\nshe is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,\\nindeed, what have you taken me for? I won’t have your sacrifice, Dounia,\\nI won’t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it\\nshall not, it shall not! I won’t accept it!”\\n\\nHe suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.\\n\\n“It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You’ll\\nforbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your\\nside to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, you\\nwill devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a\\npost_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that’s all _words_, but\\nnow? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? And\\nwhat are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their\\nhundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs. How are\\nyou going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch\\nVahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for\\nthem? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind\\nwith knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a\\nshadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have\\nbecome of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those\\nten years? Can you fancy?”\\n\\nSo he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and\\nfinding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not\\nnew ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It was\\nlong since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long\\nago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and\\ngathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken\\nthe form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured\\nhis heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his\\nmother’s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear\\nthat he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved\\nquestions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it\\nquickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...\\n\\n“Or throw up life altogether!” he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--“accept\\none’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in\\noneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!”\\n\\n“Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have\\nabsolutely nowhere to turn?” Marmeladov’s question came suddenly into\\nhis mind, “for every man must have somewhere to turn....”\\n\\nHe gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,\\nslipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought\\nrecurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must\\ncome back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday’s\\nthought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the\\nthought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,\\nit had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly\\nbecame aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, and\\nthere was a darkness before his eyes.\\n\\nHe looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted\\nto sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----\\nBoulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He\\nwalked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little\\nadventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had\\nnoticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first\\nhe took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his\\npath. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the\\nroad by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But\\nthere was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front\\nof him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first\\nreluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more\\nintently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so\\nstrange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl\\nquite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with\\nno parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had\\non a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not\\nproperly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the\\nwaist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was\\nflung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was\\nwalking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She\\ndrew Raskolnikov’s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the\\nseat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;\\nshe let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,\\napparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once\\nthat she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He\\ncould hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the\\nface of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than\\nfifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking\\nand, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was\\ndoing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and\\nshowed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.\\n\\nRaskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,\\nand stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much\\nfrequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite\\ndeserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen\\npaces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,\\ntoo, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object\\nof his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had\\nfollowed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at\\nhim, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding\\nhis time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His\\nintentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set\\nman, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and\\nmoustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult\\nthis fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked\\ntowards the gentleman.\\n\\n“Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?” he shouted, clenching\\nhis fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty\\nastonishment.\\n\\n“Get away, that’s what I mean.”\\n\\n“How dare you, you low fellow!”\\n\\nHe raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without\\nreflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like\\nhimself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a\\npolice constable stood between them.\\n\\n“That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What\\ndo you want? Who are you?” he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his\\nrags.\\n\\nRaskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,\\nsoldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.\\n\\n“You are just the man I want,” Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.\\n“I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,” he\\nadded, addressing the gentleman, “come along, I have something to show\\nyou.”\\n\\nAnd taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.\\n\\n“Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.\\nThere is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a\\nprofessional. It’s more likely she has been given drink and deceived\\nsomewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they’ve put her\\nout into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and\\nthe way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has\\nnot dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands;\\nthat’s evident. And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I\\nwas going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen\\nher on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now\\nhe is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she\\nis in this state... that’s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw\\nhim myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he\\nis just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and\\nis standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we\\nkeep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”\\n\\nThe policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to\\nunderstand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to\\nexamine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.\\n\\n“Ah, what a pity!” he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite a\\nchild! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,”\\n he began addressing her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her weary\\nand sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her\\nhand.\\n\\n“Here,” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty\\ncopecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The\\nonly thing is to find out her address!”\\n\\n“Missy, missy!” the policeman began again, taking the money. “I’ll fetch\\nyou a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do\\nyou live?”\\n\\n“Go away! They won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once more\\nwaved her hand.\\n\\n“Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!” He shook\\nhis head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.\\n\\n“It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he\\ndid so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have\\nseemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!\\n\\n“Did you meet her far from here?” he asked him.\\n\\n“I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in\\nthe boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.”\\n\\n“Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have\\nmercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been\\ndeceived, that’s a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....\\nAh, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to\\ngentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.\\nShe looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,” and he bent over her\\nonce more.\\n\\nPerhaps he had daughters growing up like that, “looking like ladies and\\nrefined” with pretensions to gentility and smartness....\\n\\n“The chief thing is,” Raskolnikov persisted, “to keep her out of this\\nscoundrel’s hands! Why should he outrage her! It’s as clear as day what\\nhe is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,\\nand seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and\\nconfined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another\\nten paces away and again halted.\\n\\n“Keep her out of his hands we can,” said the constable thoughtfully,\\n“if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,\\nmissy!” he bent over her once more.\\n\\nShe opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as\\nthough realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the\\ndirection from which she had come. “Oh shameful wretches, they won’t let\\nme alone!” she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though\\nstaggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,\\nkeeping his eye on her.\\n\\n“Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,” the policeman said\\nresolutely, and he set off after them.\\n\\n“Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!” he repeated aloud, sighing.\\n\\nAt that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a\\ncomplete revulsion of feeling came over him.\\n\\n“Hey, here!” he shouted after the policeman.\\n\\nThe latter turned round.\\n\\n“Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse\\nhimself.” He pointed at the dandy, “What is it to do with you?”\\n\\nThe policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov\\nlaughed.\\n\\n“Well!” ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he\\nwalked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a\\nmadman or something even worse.\\n\\n“He has carried off my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov murmured angrily\\nwhen he was left alone. “Well, let him take as much from the other\\nfellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I\\nwant to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let\\nthem devour each other alive--what is it to me? How did I dare to give him\\ntwenty copecks? Were they mine?”\\n\\nIn spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on\\nthe deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard\\nto fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself\\naltogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life\\nanew....\\n\\n“Poor girl!” he said, looking at the empty corner where she had\\nsat--“She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find\\nout.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and\\nthen maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the\\nDarya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be\\nslipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital\\ndirectly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectable\\nmothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...\\ndrink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a\\nwreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen\\ncases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they’ve all\\ncome to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That’s as it should\\nbe, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year\\ngo... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain\\nchaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words\\nthey have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you’ve said\\n‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about. If we had any other\\nword... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one\\nof the percentage! Of another one if not that one?\\n\\n“But where am I going?” he thought suddenly. “Strange, I came out for\\nsomething. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going\\nto Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s what it was... now I\\nremember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin\\ninto my head just now? That’s curious.”\\n\\nHe wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the\\nuniversity. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at\\nthe university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did\\nnot welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave\\nhim up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or\\nconversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,\\nand he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,\\nand there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though\\nhe were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades\\nto look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in\\ndevelopment, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and\\ninterests were beneath him.\\n\\nWith Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and\\ncommunicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other\\nterms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid\\nyouth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and\\ndignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades\\nunderstood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,\\nthough he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking\\nappearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was\\nsometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.\\nOne night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid\\na gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking\\npowers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went\\ntoo far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.\\nAnother thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and\\nit seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He\\ncould lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was\\nvery poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of\\none sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn\\nmoney. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to\\ndeclare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in\\nthe cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the\\nuniversity, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his\\nmight to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had\\nnot been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even\\nknow his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,\\nbut Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that\\nhe might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed\\nhim by, as he did not want to annoy him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask for\\nwork, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought,\\n“but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose\\nhe shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that\\nI could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...\\nhm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I\\nearn? That’s not what I want now. It’s really absurd for me to go to\\nRazumihin....”\\n\\nThe question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more\\nthan he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister\\nsignificance in this apparently ordinary action.\\n\\n“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by\\nmeans of Razumihin alone?” he asked himself in perplexity.\\n\\nHe pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long\\nmusing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic\\nthought came into his head.\\n\\n“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had\\nreached a final determination. “I shall go to Razumihin’s of course,\\nbut... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It\\nwill be over and everything will begin afresh....”\\n\\nAnd suddenly he realised what he was thinking.\\n\\n“After It,” he shouted, jumping up from the seat, “but is It really\\ngoing to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?” He left the\\nseat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,\\nbut the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;\\nin that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a\\nmonth past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.\\n\\nHis nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel\\nshivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he\\nbegan almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all\\nthe objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his\\nattention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into\\nbrooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,\\nhe forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he\\nwas going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came\\nout on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the\\nislands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary\\neyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in\\nand weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,\\nno stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid\\nirritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer\\nvilla standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw\\nin the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,\\nand children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his\\nattention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by\\nluxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them\\nwith curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from\\nhis sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had\\nthirty copecks. “Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the\\nletter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs\\nyesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he\\nsoon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.\\nHe recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he\\nwas hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a\\npie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long\\nwhile since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,\\nthough he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and\\na great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching\\nPetrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road\\ninto the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.\\n\\nIn a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular\\nactuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times\\nmonstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are\\nso truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but\\nso artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like\\nPushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking\\nstate. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a\\npowerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.\\n\\nRaskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood\\nin the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,\\nwalking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It\\nwas a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;\\nindeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in\\nmemory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not\\neven a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\\nblur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market\\ngarden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\\nfeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.\\nThere was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\\nhideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking\\nfigures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his\\nfather, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road\\nbecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a\\nwinding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\\nright to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\\nchurch with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\\ntimes a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in\\nmemory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\\nseen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a\\ntable napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in\\nthe shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned\\nikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother’s\\ngrave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger\\nbrother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,\\nbut he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited\\nthe graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and\\nto bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was\\nwalking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\\nwas holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A\\npeculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\\nsome kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\\ntownspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\\nall singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern\\nstood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually\\ndrawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\\ngoods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\\nlong manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\\nmountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\\nwith a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\\nsuch a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’\\nnags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load\\nof wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\\na rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\\nabout the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\\nhe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\\nwindow. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing\\nand the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken\\npeasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over\\ntheir shoulders.\\n\\n“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with\\na fleshy face red as a carrot. “I’ll take you all, get in!”\\n\\nBut at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the\\ncrowd.\\n\\n“Take us all with a beast like that!”\\n\\n“Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?”\\n\\n“And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”\\n\\n“Get in, I’ll take you all,” Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into\\nthe cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. “The bay\\nhas gone with Matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates,\\nis just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She’s just\\neating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll\\ngallop!” and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to\\nflog the little mare.\\n\\n“Get in! Come along!” The crowd laughed. “D’you hear, she’ll gallop!”\\n\\n“Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”\\n\\n“She’ll jog along!”\\n\\n“Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”\\n\\n“All right! Give it to her!”\\n\\nThey all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes. Six\\nmen got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,\\nrosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded\\nheaddress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.\\nThe crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help\\nlaughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a\\ngallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to\\nhelp Mikolka. With the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might,\\nbut far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with\\nher legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which\\nwere showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the\\ncrowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed\\nthe mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.\\n\\n“Let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whose\\nappetite was aroused.\\n\\n“Get in, all get in,” cried Mikolka, “she will draw you all. I’ll beat\\nher to death!” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself\\nwith fury.\\n\\n“Father, father,” he cried, “father, what are they doing? Father, they\\nare beating the poor horse!”\\n\\n“Come along, come along!” said his father. “They are drunken and\\nfoolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t look!” and he tried to draw\\nhim away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself\\nwith horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was\\ngasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.\\n\\n“Beat her to death,” cried Mikolka, “it’s come to that. I’ll do for\\nher!”\\n\\n“What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?” shouted an old man\\nin the crowd.\\n\\n“Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a\\ncartload,” said another.\\n\\n“You’ll kill her,” shouted the third.\\n\\n“Don’t meddle! It’s my property, I’ll do what I choose. Get in, more of\\nyou! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!...”\\n\\nAll at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,\\nroused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man\\ncould not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that\\ntrying to kick!\\n\\nTwo lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her\\nabout the ribs. One ran each side.\\n\\n“Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,” cried Mikolka.\\n\\n“Give us a song, mates,” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the\\ncart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The\\nwoman went on cracking nuts and laughing.\\n\\n... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped\\nacross the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his\\ntears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across\\nthe face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he\\nrushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was\\nshaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and\\nwould have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to\\nthe mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.\\n\\n“I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down\\nthe whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,\\nthick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort\\nbrandished it over the mare.\\n\\n“He’ll crush her,” was shouted round him. “He’ll kill her!”\\n\\n“It’s my property,” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a\\nswinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.\\n\\n“Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?” shouted voices in the\\ncrowd.\\n\\nAnd Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time\\non the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but\\nlurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on\\none side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six\\nwhips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised\\nagain and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured\\nblows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.\\n\\n“She’s a tough one,” was shouted in the crowd.\\n\\n“She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,” said\\nan admiring spectator in the crowd.\\n\\n“Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,” shouted a third.\\n\\n“I’ll show you! Stand off,” Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down\\nthe shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. “Look\\nout,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the\\npoor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,\\nbut the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on\\nthe ground like a log.\\n\\n“Finish her off,” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of\\nthe cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything\\nthey could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying\\nmare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the\\ncrowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.\\n\\n“You butchered her,” someone shouted in the crowd.\\n\\n“Why wouldn’t she gallop then?”\\n\\n“My property!” shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar\\nin his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to\\nbeat.\\n\\n“No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,” many voices were\\nshouting in the crowd.\\n\\nBut the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the\\ncrowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and\\nkissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and\\nflew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant\\nhis father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried\\nhim out of the crowd.\\n\\n“Come along, come! Let us go home,” he said to him.\\n\\n“Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!” he sobbed, but his\\nvoice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.\\n\\n“They are drunk.... They are brutal... it’s not our business!” said his\\nfather. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. He\\ntried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.\\n\\nHe waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and\\nstood up in terror.\\n\\n“Thank God, that was only a dream,” he said, sitting down under a tree\\nand drawing deep breaths. “But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?\\nSuch a hideous dream!”\\n\\nHe felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He\\nrested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.\\n\\n“Good God!” he cried, “can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an\\naxe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I\\nshall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;\\nhide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it\\nbe?”\\n\\nHe was shaking like a leaf as he said this.\\n\\n“But why am I going on like this?” he continued, sitting up again, as it\\nwere in profound amazement. “I knew that I could never bring myself\\nto it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,\\nyesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I\\nrealised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going\\nover it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs\\nyesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the\\nvery thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.\\n\\n“No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Granted, granted that there is\\nno flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last\\nmonth is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn’t\\nbring myself to it! I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Why, why then am\\nI still...?”\\n\\nHe rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at\\nfinding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,\\nhis eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly\\nto breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that\\nhad so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense\\nof relief and peace in his soul. “Lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--I\\nrenounce that accursed... dream of mine.”\\n\\nCrossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the\\nglowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he\\nwas not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been\\nforming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,\\nfreedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!\\n\\nLater on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during\\nthose days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously\\nimpressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very\\nexceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined\\nturning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to\\nhimself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been\\nmore convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,\\nhe had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was\\nobviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It\\nis true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without\\nnoticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking\\nhimself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time\\nsuch an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he\\nhad moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his\\nlife when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances\\nin which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive\\ninfluence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for\\nhim on purpose!\\n\\nIt was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables\\nand the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were\\nclosing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their\\nwares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and\\ncostermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty\\nand stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly\\nliked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly\\nin the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,\\nand one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At\\nthe corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out\\nwith tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to\\ngo home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just\\ncome up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone\\ncalled her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona\\nIvanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his\\nwatch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta\\nand she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about\\nthirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was\\na complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who\\nmade her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with\\na bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and\\ndoubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The\\nmoment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange\\nsensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing\\nastonishing about this meeting.\\n\\n“You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” the\\nhuckster was saying aloud. “Come round to-morrow about seven. They will\\nbe here too.”\\n\\n“To-morrow?” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to\\nmake up her mind.\\n\\n“Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,” gabbled\\nthe huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “I look at you, you are like\\nsome little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a\\nstep-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”\\n\\n“But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,” her husband\\ninterrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking.\\nIt will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a\\nnotion.”\\n\\n“Am I to come?”\\n\\n“About seven o’clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able\\nto decide for yourself.”\\n\\n“And we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife.\\n\\n“All right, I’ll come,” said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began\\nslowly moving away.\\n\\nRaskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,\\nunnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed\\nby a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had\\nlearnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at\\nseven o’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, would\\nbe away from home and that therefore at seven o’clock precisely the old\\nwoman _would be left alone_.\\n\\nHe was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man\\ncondemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;\\nbut he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom\\nof thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably\\ndecided.\\n\\nCertainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he\\ncould not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan\\nthan that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have\\nbeen difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with\\ngreater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and\\ninvestigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose\\nlife an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nLater on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his\\nwife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was\\nnothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been\\nreduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all\\nwomen’s things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,\\nthey were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta’s business. She\\nundertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest\\nand always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule\\nlittle and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.\\n\\nBut Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of\\nsuperstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.\\nAnd in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something\\nstrange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar\\ninfluences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew\\ncalled Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to\\ngive him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he\\nmight want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for\\nhe had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had\\nremembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his\\nfather’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,\\na present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When\\nhe found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her\\nat the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got\\ntwo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way\\nhome. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange\\nidea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very\\nmuch absorbed him.\\n\\nAlmost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he\\ndid not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had\\nplayed a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard\\nthe student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and\\ngive him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he\\nhad just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course\\nit was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary\\nimpression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;\\nthe student began telling his friend various details about Alyona\\nIvanovna.\\n\\n“She is first-rate,” he said. “You can always get money from her. She is\\nas rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and\\nshe is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have\\nhad dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....”\\n\\nAnd he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you\\nwere only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she\\ngave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven\\npercent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying\\nthat she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was\\ncontinually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,\\nthough Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\\n\\n“There’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed.\\n\\nThey began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a\\npeculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened\\nwith great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending\\nfor him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about\\nher. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,\\nbeing the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked\\nday and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the\\nwashing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister\\nall she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind\\nwithout her sister’s permission. The old woman had already made her\\nwill, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a\\nfarthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was\\nleft to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be\\nsaid for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,\\nunmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long\\nfeet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered\\ngoatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed\\nmost surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was\\ncontinually with child.\\n\\n“But you say she is hideous?” observed the officer.\\n\\n“Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but\\nyou know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face\\nand eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are\\nattracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up\\nwith anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is\\nreally very sweet.”\\n\\n“You seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer.\\n\\n“From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill that damned\\nold woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the\\nfaintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth. The officer\\nlaughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\\n\\n“Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly.\\n“I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,\\nsenseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply\\nuseless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is\\nliving for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You\\nunderstand? You understand?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I understand,” answered the officer, watching his excited\\ncompanion attentively.\\n\\n“Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for\\nwant of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good\\ndeeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be\\nburied in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the\\nright path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from\\nvice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take\\nher money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of\\nhumanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny\\ncrime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands\\nwould be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives\\nin exchange--it’s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of\\nthat sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!\\nNo more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact\\nbecause the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of\\nothers; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almost\\nhad to be amputated.”\\n\\n“Of course she does not deserve to live,” remarked the officer, “but\\nthere it is, it’s nature.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but\\nfor that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,\\nthere would never have been a single great man. They talk of\\nduty, conscience--I don’t want to say anything against duty and\\nconscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have\\nanother question to ask you. Listen!”\\n\\n“No, you stay, I’ll ask you a question. Listen!”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the\\nold woman _yourself_?”\\n\\n“Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It’s nothing to\\ndo with me....”\\n\\n“But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no justice about\\nit.... Let us have another game.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary\\nyouthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in\\ndifferent forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear\\nsuch a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain\\nwas just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the\\nmoment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old\\nwoman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This\\ncoincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern\\nhad an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had\\nreally been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....\\n\\n*****\\n\\nOn returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat\\nfor a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no\\ncandle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never\\nrecollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At\\nlast he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised\\nwith relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep\\ncame over him, as it were crushing him.\\n\\nHe slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,\\ncoming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficulty\\nin rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the\\nsecond brew and again in her own tea-pot.\\n\\n“My goodness, how he sleeps!” she cried indignantly. “And he is always\\nasleep.”\\n\\nHe got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in\\nhis garret and sank back on the sofa again.\\n\\n“Going to sleep again,” cried Nastasya. “Are you ill, eh?”\\n\\nHe made no reply.\\n\\n“Do you want some tea?”\\n\\n“Afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning\\nto the wall.\\n\\nNastasya stood over him.\\n\\n“Perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out. She came in\\nagain at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood\\nuntouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully\\nrousing him.\\n\\n“Why are you lying like a log?” she shouted, looking at him with\\nrepulsion.\\n\\nHe got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.\\n\\n“Are you ill or not?” asked Nastasya and again received no answer.\\n“You’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause.\\n“Will you eat it or not?”\\n\\n“Afterwards,” he said weakly. “You can go.”\\n\\nAnd he motioned her out.\\n\\nShe remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went\\nout.\\n\\nA few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while\\nat the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and\\nbegan to eat.\\n\\nHe ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were\\nmechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself\\non the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,\\nwith his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such\\nstrange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was\\nin Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,\\nthe camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a\\ncomplete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water\\nfrom a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was\\nwonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured\\nstones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like\\ngold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,\\nraised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,\\nsuddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the\\nsofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began\\nlistening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet\\non the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and\\nmonstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the\\nprevious day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And\\nmeanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction\\nwere followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted\\nhaste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his\\nenergies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart\\nkept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had\\nto make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He\\nrummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away\\nunder it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long\\nstrip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded\\nthis strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some\\nstout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two\\nends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook\\nas he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside\\nwhen he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready\\nlong before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the\\nnoose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended\\nfor the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the\\nstreet in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have\\nhad to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now\\nhe had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang\\nquietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat\\npocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did\\nnot swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it\\ncould not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the\\nhand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a\\nfortnight before.\\n\\nWhen he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening\\nbetween his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\\nthe _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This\\npledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and\\nthickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood\\nin one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of\\na workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece\\nof iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.\\nPutting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,\\nhe fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round\\nthem; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and\\ntied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This\\nwas in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while\\nshe was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip\\nwas added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first\\nminute that the “thing” was made of wood. All this had been stored by\\nhim beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when\\nhe heard someone suddenly about in the yard.\\n\\n“It struck six long ago.”\\n\\n“Long ago! My God!”\\n\\nHe rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend\\nhis thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the\\nmost important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the\\ndeed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a\\npocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less\\non his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in\\npassing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by\\nhim in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final\\nthey were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in\\nhis eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for\\na single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his\\nplans.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point\\ncould have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of\\nany kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all\\nas something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of\\nunsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,\\nthat trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.\\nNastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;\\nshe would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the\\ndoor ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her\\nabout. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into\\nthe kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything\\nwas over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.\\nSupposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had\\ncome back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait\\ntill she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss\\nthe axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at\\nleast grounds for suspicion.\\n\\nBut those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and\\nindeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off\\ntrifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed\\nutterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not\\nimagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get\\nup and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with\\nthe object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at\\nan experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say\\n“come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once he\\nhad broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.\\nMeanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his\\nanalysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he\\ncould not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort\\nhe simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought\\narguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were\\nforcing and drawing him to it.\\n\\nAt first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one\\nquestion; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily\\ndetected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He\\nhad come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his\\nopinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility\\nof concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every\\ncriminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a\\nchildish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence\\nand caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse\\nof reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,\\ndeveloped gradually and reached its highest point just before the\\nperpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment\\nof the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the\\nindividual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The\\nquestion whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the\\ncrime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of\\nthe nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\\n\\nWhen he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there\\ncould not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would\\nremain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the\\nsimple reason that his design was “not a crime....” We will omit all the\\nprocess by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have\\nrun too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely\\nmaterial difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his\\nmind. “One has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to deal\\nwith them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has\\nfamiliarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” But\\nthis preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he\\ncame to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\\ndifferently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\\n\\nOne trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even\\nleft the staircase. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door\\nof which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in\\nNastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether\\nthe door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when\\nhe went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly\\nsaw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied\\nthere, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing\\nhim, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him\\nall the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as\\nthough he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not\\nthe axe! He was overwhelmed.\\n\\n“What made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “what\\nmade me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!\\nWhy, why, why did I assume this so certainly?”\\n\\nHe was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in\\nhis anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.\\n\\nHe stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk\\nfor appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more\\nrevolting. “And what a chance I have lost for ever!” he muttered,\\nstanding aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little\\ndark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’s\\nroom, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the\\nright caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the\\nroom on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called\\nthe porter. “Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for\\nthe door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled\\nit out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;\\nat once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both\\nhands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!\\n“When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin.\\nThis chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.\\n\\nHe walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening\\nsuspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking\\nat their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.\\nSuddenly he thought of his hat. “Good heavens! I had the money the day\\nbefore yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!” A curse rose\\nfrom the bottom of his soul.\\n\\nGlancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on\\nthe wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at\\nthe same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the\\nother side....\\n\\nWhen he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes\\nthought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much\\nafraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied\\nby irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov\\ngarden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great\\nfountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all\\nthe squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer\\ngarden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the\\ngarden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a\\ngreat benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why\\nin all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some\\npeculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there\\nare no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all\\nsorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back\\nto his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. “What nonsense!”\\n he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”\\n\\n“So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that\\nmeets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,\\nlike lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now\\nhe was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\\nsomewhere struck once. “What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it\\nmust be fast!”\\n\\nLuckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very\\nmoment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had\\njust driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under\\nthe gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into\\nthe yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other\\nside of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one\\nnoticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge\\nquadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his\\nhead--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old\\nwoman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was\\nalready on the stairs....\\n\\nDrawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and\\nonce more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly\\nand cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the\\nstairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no\\none. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were\\nat work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought\\na minute and went on. “Of course it would be better if they had not been\\nhere, but... it’s two storeys above them.”\\n\\nAnd there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the\\nflat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman’s was\\napparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been\\ntorn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant\\nthe thought floated through his mind “Shall I go back?” But he made no\\nanswer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence. Then\\nhe listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...\\nthen looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew\\nhimself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. “Am I very pale?”\\n he wondered. “Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I\\nbetter wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”\\n\\nBut his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite\\nhim, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,\\nhe slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he\\nrang again, more loudly.\\n\\nNo answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman\\nwas, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some\\nknowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.\\nEither his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to\\nsuppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly\\nheard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the\\nrustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily\\nclose to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly\\nlistening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved\\na little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have\\nthe appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,\\nand without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out\\nin his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he\\nhad had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and\\nhe was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the\\nlatch unfastened.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nThe door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and\\nsuspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost\\nhis head and nearly made a great mistake.\\n\\nFearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not\\nhoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took\\nhold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from\\nattempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,\\nbut she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with\\nit on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not\\nallowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back\\nin alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared\\nwith open eyes at him.\\n\\n“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, but\\nhis voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. “I have come... I have\\nbrought something... but we’d better come in... to the light....”\\n\\nAnd leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old\\nwoman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.\\n\\n“Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?”\\n\\n“Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you\\nthe pledge I promised the other day...” And he held out the pledge.\\n\\nThe old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in\\nthe eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and\\nmistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer\\nin her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that\\nhe was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened\\nthat if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half\\nminute, he thought he would have run away from her.\\n\\n“Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?” he said suddenly,\\nalso with malice. “Take it if you like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I am\\nin a hurry.”\\n\\nHe had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of\\nitself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute tone\\nevidently restored her confidence.\\n\\n“But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?” she asked,\\nlooking at the pledge.\\n\\n“The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.”\\n\\nShe held out her hand.\\n\\n“But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?\\nHave you been bathing, or what?”\\n\\n“Fever,” he answered abruptly. “You can’t help getting pale... if you’ve\\nnothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words.\\n\\nHis strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the\\ntruth; the old woman took the pledge.\\n\\n“What is it?” she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and\\nweighing the pledge in her hand.\\n\\n“A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.”\\n\\n“It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!”\\n\\nTrying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all\\nher windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left\\nhim altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He\\nunbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet\\ntake it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the\\ncoat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing\\nmore numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and\\nfall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.\\n\\n“But what has he tied it up like this for?” the old woman cried with\\nvexation and moved towards him.\\n\\nHe had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung\\nit with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without\\neffort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He\\nseemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once\\nbrought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\\n\\nThe old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked\\nwith grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail and\\nfastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.\\nAs she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She\\ncried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the\\nfloor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held “the\\npledge.” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side\\nand on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the\\nbody fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her\\nface; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,\\nthe brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\\n\\nHe laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her\\npocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket\\nfrom which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full\\npossession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his\\nhands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been\\nparticularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get\\nsmeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,\\nas before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom\\nwith them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.\\nAgainst the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with\\na silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of\\ndrawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the\\nchest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed\\nover him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go\\naway. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.\\nHe positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea\\noccurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be\\nstill alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,\\nhe ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more\\nover the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that\\nshe was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw\\nclearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He\\nwas about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed\\nit was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of\\nblood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but\\nthe string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked\\nwith blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but\\nsomething held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised\\nthe axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not\\ndare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,\\nafter two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off\\nwithout touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a\\npurse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of\\ncopper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy\\nchamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed\\nvery full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,\\nflung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into the\\nbedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\\n\\nHe was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them\\nagain. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\\nwas not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making\\nmistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one\\nand would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered\\nand realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging\\nthere with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of\\ndrawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,\\nand that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest\\nof drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old\\nwomen usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a\\ngood-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched\\nlid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched\\nkey fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\\na coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,\\nthen a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but\\nclothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on\\nthe red brocade. “It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,”\\n the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.\\n“Good God, am I going out of my senses?” he thought with terror.\\n\\nBut no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from\\nunder the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned\\nout to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably\\nall pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,\\near-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply\\nwrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\\ntape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers\\nand overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he\\nhad not time to take many....\\n\\nHe suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped\\nshort and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been\\nhis fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though\\nsomeone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for\\na minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited\\nholding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of\\nthe bedroom.\\n\\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.\\nShe was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet\\nand seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out\\nof the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a\\nshudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but\\nstill did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the\\ncorner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no\\nsound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her\\nwith the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths,\\nwhen they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them\\nand are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so\\nsimple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not\\neven raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary\\nand natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.\\nShe only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding\\nit out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the\\nsharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the\\nhead. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,\\nsnatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\\n\\nFear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this\\nsecond, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place\\nas fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing\\nand reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the\\ndifficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the\\nabsurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,\\nperhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of\\nthat place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would\\nhave flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and\\nnot from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had\\ndone. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew\\nstronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even\\ninto the room for anything in the world.\\n\\nBut a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take\\npossession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what\\nwas of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the\\nkitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought\\nhim of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.\\nHe dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap\\nthat lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands\\nin the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the\\nblade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where\\nthere were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all\\nwith some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and\\nthen he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.\\nThere was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\\ncarefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was\\npossible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\\nhis trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be\\nnothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\\nBut he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something\\nquite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the\\nroom, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea\\nthat he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,\\nof protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something\\nutterly different from what he was now doing. “Good God!” he muttered “I\\nmust fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror\\nawaited him such as he had never known before.\\n\\nHe stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer\\ndoor from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,\\nwas standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,\\nall the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him\\nperhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta\\nafterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that\\nshe must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!\\n\\nHe dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\\n\\n“But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....”\\n\\nHe unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the\\nstaircase.\\n\\nHe listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,\\ntwo voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.\\n“What are they about?” He waited patiently. At last all was still, as\\nthough suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,\\nbut suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone\\nbegan going downstairs humming a tune. “How is it they all make such\\na noise?” flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and\\nwaited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a\\nstep towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.\\n\\nThe steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but\\nhe remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\\nbegan for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,\\nto the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow\\npeculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now\\n_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was\\ngrowing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And\\nnow the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to\\nhim all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream\\nin which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\\nrooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.\\n\\nAt last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly\\nstarted, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the\\nflat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,\\nnoiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had\\ndone this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown\\nvisitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one\\nanother, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when\\nthe door divided them and he was listening.\\n\\nThe visitor panted several times. “He must be a big, fat man,” thought\\nRaskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream\\nindeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.\\n\\nAs soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of\\nsomething moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite\\nseriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently\\nand impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\\nat the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every\\nminute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem\\npossible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the\\nfastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him\\nagain. “I shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknown\\nbegan to speak and he recovered himself at once.\\n\\n“What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!” he bawled in a\\nthick voice, “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,\\nmy beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?”\\n\\nAnd again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at\\nthe bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nAt this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the\\nstairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at\\nfirst.\\n\\n“You don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a\\ncheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on\\npulling the bell. “Good evening, Koch.”\\n\\n“From his voice he must be quite young,” thought Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,” answered Koch.\\n“But how do you come to know me?”\\n\\n“Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at\\nbilliards at Gambrinus’.”\\n\\n“Oh!”\\n\\n“So they are not at home? That’s queer. It’s awfully stupid though.\\nWhere could the old woman have gone? I’ve come on business.”\\n\\n“Yes; and I have business with her, too.”\\n\\n“Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to\\nget some money!” cried the young man.\\n\\n“We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The\\nold witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It’s out of my way.\\nAnd where the devil she can have got to, I can’t make out. She sits here\\nfrom year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet\\nhere all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”\\n\\n“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”\\n\\n“Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go\\nanywhere.”\\n\\nAnd he once more tugged at the door-handle.\\n\\n“Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”\\n\\n“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly. “Do you see how the door shakes if\\nyou pull it?”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how\\nthe hook clanks?”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they\\nwere all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the\\nkey and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook\\nis clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,\\ndon’t you see. So there they are sitting inside and don’t open the\\ndoor!”\\n\\n“Well! And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished. “What are they\\nabout in there?” And he began furiously shaking the door.\\n\\n“Stay!” cried the young man again. “Don’t pull at it! There must be\\nsomething wrong.... Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door\\nand still they don’t open! So either they’ve both fainted or...”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I tell you what. Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”\\n\\n“All right.”\\n\\nBoth were going down.\\n\\n“Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.”\\n\\n“What for?”\\n\\n“Well, you’d better.”\\n\\n“All right.”\\n\\n“I’m studying the law you see! It’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s something\\nwrong here!” the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.\\n\\nKoch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one\\ntinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began\\ntouching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once\\nmore that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he\\nbent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock\\non the inside and so nothing could be seen.\\n\\nRaskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of\\ndelirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.\\nWhile they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times\\noccurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the\\ndoor. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,\\nwhile they could not open the door! “Only make haste!” was the thought\\nthat flashed through his mind.\\n\\n“But what the devil is he about?...” Time was passing, one minute, and\\nanother--no one came. Koch began to be restless.\\n\\n“What the devil?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his\\nsentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy\\nboots on the stairs. The steps died away.\\n\\n“Good heavens! What am I to do?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.\\nAbruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as\\nthoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\\n\\nHe had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice\\nbelow--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going\\nback to the flat.\\n\\n“Hey there! Catch the brute!”\\n\\nSomebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran\\ndown the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.\\n\\n“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!”\\n\\nThe shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was\\nstill. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began\\nnoisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He\\ndistinguished the ringing voice of the young man. “Hey!”\\n\\nFilled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come what\\nmust!” If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was\\nlost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only\\na flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the\\nright, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the\\nsecond floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though\\nfor his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just\\nrun down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle\\nof the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\\ninstant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall\\nand only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.\\nThen they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He\\nwaited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\\n\\nNo one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through\\nthe gateway and turned to the left in the street.\\n\\nHe knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the\\nflat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as\\nthe door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the\\nbodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and\\ncompletely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had\\nsucceeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would\\nguess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were\\ngoing upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though\\nthe next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. “Should he\\nslip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,\\nhopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,\\nhopeless!”\\n\\nAt last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.\\nHere he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\\nbecause there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a\\ngrain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could\\nscarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.\\n“My word, he has been going it!” someone shouted at him when he came out\\non the canal bank.\\n\\nHe was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the\\nworse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal\\nbank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more\\nconspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost\\nfalling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from\\nquite a different direction.\\n\\nHe was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his\\nhouse! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.\\nAnd yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to\\nescape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course\\nincapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to\\nrestore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard. But\\nit all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closed\\nbut not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at\\nhome. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he\\nwalked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,\\n“What do you want?” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But\\nagain the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe\\nback under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as\\nbefore. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;\\nthe landlady’s door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself\\non the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank\\nforgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have\\njumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were\\nsimply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could\\nnot rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART II\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nSo he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at\\nsuch moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not\\noccur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get\\nlight. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.\\nFearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he\\nheard every night, indeed, under his window after two o’clock. They woke\\nhim up now.\\n\\n“Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,” he thought, “it’s\\npast two o’clock,” and at once he leaped up, as though someone had\\npulled him from the sofa.\\n\\n“What! Past two o’clock!”\\n\\nHe sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at\\nonce, in one flash, he recollected everything.\\n\\nFor the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came\\nover him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in\\nhis sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his\\nteeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and\\nbegan listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he\\ngazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he\\ncould have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have\\nflung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his\\nhat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.\\n\\n“If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I’m drunk\\nbut...”\\n\\nHe rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly\\nlooking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there\\nno traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he\\nbegan taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything\\nover to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through\\nhis search three times.\\n\\nBut there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where\\nsome thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge\\nof his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed\\nthreads. There seemed to be nothing more.\\n\\nSuddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of\\nthe old woman’s box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till\\nthen of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them\\nwhile he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed\\nto take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out\\neverything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was\\nnothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had\\ncome off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began\\nstuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: “They’re in! All\\nout of sight, and the purse too!” he thought gleefully, getting up and\\ngazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly\\nhe shuddered all over with horror; “My God!” he whispered in despair:\\n“what’s the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide\\nthings?”\\n\\nHe had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of\\nmoney, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.\\n\\n“But now, now, what am I glad of?” he thought, “Is that hiding things?\\nMy reason’s deserting me--simply!”\\n\\nHe sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another\\nunbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside\\nhim his old student’s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in\\nrags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and\\ndelirium. He lost consciousness.\\n\\nNot more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,\\nand at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.\\n\\n“How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not\\ntaken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!\\nSuch a piece of evidence!”\\n\\nHe pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits\\namong his linen under the pillow.\\n\\n“Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I\\nthink not, I think not, any way!” he repeated, standing in the middle\\nof the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about\\nhim again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not\\nforgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,\\nand the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an\\ninsufferable torture.\\n\\n“Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my punishment coming\\nupon me? It is!”\\n\\nThe frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the\\nfloor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!\\n\\n“What is the matter with me!” he cried again, like one distraught.\\n\\nThen a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes\\nwere covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many\\nstains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because\\nhis perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was\\nclouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the\\npurse too. “Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\\nthe wet purse in my pocket!”\\n\\nIn a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were\\ntraces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\\n\\n“So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and\\nmemory, since I guessed it of myself,” he thought triumphantly, with\\na deep sigh of relief; “it’s simply the weakness of fever, a moment’s\\ndelirium,” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his\\ntrousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the\\nsock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He\\nflung off his boots; “traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with\\nblood;” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... “But what am I\\nto do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?”\\n\\nHe gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the\\nroom.\\n\\n“In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?\\nBut what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better\\ngo out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,” he\\nrepeated, sitting down on the sofa again, “and at once, this minute,\\nwithout lingering...”\\n\\nBut his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy\\nshivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.\\n\\nAnd for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to\\n“go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\\nit may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!” Several times\\nhe tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.\\n\\nHe was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.\\n\\n“Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!” shouted\\nNastasya, banging with her fist on the door. “For whole days together\\nhe’s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It’s\\npast ten.”\\n\\n“Maybe he’s not at home,” said a man’s voice.\\n\\n“Ha! that’s the porter’s voice.... What does he want?”\\n\\nHe jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a\\npositive pain.\\n\\n“Then who can have latched the door?” retorted Nastasya. “He’s taken to\\nbolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake\\nup!”\\n\\n“What do they want? Why the porter? All’s discovered. Resist or open?\\nCome what may!...”\\n\\nHe half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.\\n\\nHis room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the\\nbed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.\\n\\nNastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and\\ndesperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded\\npaper sealed with bottle-wax.\\n\\n“A notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper.\\n\\n“From what office?”\\n\\n“A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.”\\n\\n“To the police?... What for?...”\\n\\n“How can I tell? You’re sent for, so you go.”\\n\\nThe man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to\\ngo away.\\n\\n“He’s downright ill!” observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.\\nThe porter turned his head for a moment. “He’s been in a fever since\\nyesterday,” she added.\\n\\nRaskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without\\nopening it. “Don’t you get up then,” Nastasya went on compassionately,\\nseeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. “You’re ill, and\\nso don’t go; there’s no such hurry. What have you got there?”\\n\\nHe looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his\\ntrousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep\\nwith them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that\\nhalf waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand\\nand so fallen asleep again.\\n\\n“Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has\\ngot hold of a treasure...”\\n\\nAnd Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\\n\\nInstantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his\\neyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational\\nreflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that\\nwith a person who was going to be arrested. “But... the police?”\\n\\n“You’d better have some tea! Yes? I’ll bring it, there’s some left.”\\n\\n“No... I’m going; I’ll go at once,” he muttered, getting on to his feet.\\n\\n“Why, you’ll never get downstairs!”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ll go.”\\n\\n“As you please.”\\n\\nShe followed the porter out.\\n\\nAt once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.\\n\\n“There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,\\nand rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could\\ndistinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,\\nthank God!” Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began\\nreading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an\\nordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at\\nhalf-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.\\n\\n“But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with\\nthe police! And why just to-day?” he thought in agonising bewilderment.\\n“Good God, only get it over soon!”\\n\\nHe was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into\\nlaughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\\n\\nHe began, hurriedly dressing. “If I’m lost, I am lost, I don’t care!\\nShall I put the sock on?” he suddenly wondered, “it will get dustier\\nstill and the traces will be gone.”\\n\\nBut no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing\\nand horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,\\nhe picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.\\n\\n“That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way of looking\\nat it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his\\nmind, while he was shuddering all over, “there, I’ve got it on! I have\\nfinished by getting it on!”\\n\\nBut his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\\n\\n“No, it’s too much for me...” he thought. His legs shook. “From fear,”\\n he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. “It’s a trick! They\\nwant to decoy me there and confound me over everything,” he mused, as\\nhe went out on to the stairs--“the worst of it is I’m almost\\nlight-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...”\\n\\nOn the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as\\nthey were in the hole in the wall, “and very likely, it’s on purpose\\nto search when I’m out,” he thought, and stopped short. But he was\\npossessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call\\nit, that with a wave of his hand he went on. “Only to get it over!”\\n\\nIn the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had\\nfallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench\\nfrom the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish\\npedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,\\nso that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going\\nround--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the\\nstreet on a bright sunny day.\\n\\nWhen he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of\\ntrepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted\\nhis eyes.\\n\\n“If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,” he thought, as he drew\\nnear the police-station.\\n\\nThe police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been\\nmoved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once\\nfor a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,\\nhe saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with\\na book in his hand. “A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is\\nhere,” and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want\\nto ask questions of anyone.\\n\\n“I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...” he thought, as\\nhe reached the fourth floor.\\n\\nThe staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The\\nkitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost\\nthe whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase\\nwas crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their\\narms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of\\nthe office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,\\ntoo, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh\\npaint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.\\n\\nAfter waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.\\nAll the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\\non and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some\\nclerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a\\nqueer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\nHe showed the notice he had received.\\n\\n“You are a student?” the man asked, glancing at the notice.\\n\\n“Yes, formerly a student.”\\n\\nThe clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a\\nparticularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.\\n\\n“There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no\\ninterest in anything,” thought Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Go in there to the head clerk,” said the clerk, pointing towards the\\nfurthest room.\\n\\nHe went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and\\npacked full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.\\nAmong them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the\\ntable opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.\\nThe other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,\\nexcessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a\\nsaucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.\\nRaskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced\\nat it, said: “Wait a minute,” and went on attending to the lady in\\nmourning.\\n\\nHe breathed more freely. “It can’t be that!”\\n\\nBy degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have\\ncourage and be calm.\\n\\n“Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!\\nHm... it’s a pity there’s no air here,” he added, “it’s stifling.... It\\nmakes one’s head dizzier than ever... and one’s mind too...”\\n\\nHe was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing\\nhis self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,\\nsomething quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet\\nthe head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him\\nand guess something from his face.\\n\\nHe was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile\\nface that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and\\nfoppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,\\nand wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain\\non his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who\\nwas in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\\n\\n“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the\\ngaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not\\nventuring to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.\\n\\n“Ich danke,” said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank\\ninto the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated\\nabout the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She\\nsmelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half\\nthe room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was\\nimpudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\\n\\nThe lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with\\nsome noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\\nhis shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and\\nsat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her\\nseat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the\\nofficer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to\\nsit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He\\nhad a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his\\nface, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except\\na certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at\\nRaskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his\\nhumiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his\\nclothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on\\nhim, so that he felt positively affronted.\\n\\n“What do you want?” he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged\\nfellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.\\n\\n“I was summoned... by a notice...” Raskolnikov faltered.\\n\\n“For the recovery of money due, from _the student_,” the head clerk\\ninterfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. “Here!” and he\\nflung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. “Read that!”\\n\\n“Money? What money?” thought Raskolnikov, “but... then... it’s certainly\\nnot _that_.”\\n\\nAnd he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A\\nload was lifted from his back.\\n\\n“And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?” shouted the\\nassistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more\\naggrieved. “You are told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”\\n\\n“The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,” Raskolnikov\\nanswered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew\\nsuddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. “And it’s enough that\\nI have come here ill with fever.”\\n\\n“Kindly refrain from shouting!”\\n\\n“I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who are shouting\\nat me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.”\\n\\nThe assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he\\ncould only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.\\n\\n“Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be impudent, sir!”\\n\\n“You’re in a government office, too,” cried Raskolnikov, “and you’re\\nsmoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect\\nto all of us.”\\n\\nHe felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\\n\\nThe head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant\\nsuperintendent was obviously disconcerted.\\n\\n“That’s not your business!” he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.\\n“Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr\\nGrigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don’t pay your\\ndebts! You’re a fine bird!”\\n\\nBut Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the\\npaper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second\\ntime, and still did not understand.\\n\\n“What is this?” he asked the head clerk.\\n\\n“It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must\\neither pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written\\ndeclaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not\\nto leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your\\nproperty. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed\\nagainst you according to the law.”\\n\\n“But I... am not in debt to anyone!”\\n\\n“That’s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen\\nroubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us\\nfor recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine\\nmonths ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.\\nWe therefore summon you, hereupon.”\\n\\n“But she is my landlady!”\\n\\n“And what if she is your landlady?”\\n\\nThe head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,\\nand at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire\\nfor the first time--as though he would say: “Well, how do you feel now?”\\n But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that\\nworth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he\\nread, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but\\nall mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from\\noverwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment\\nwithout thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions\\nor surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant\\nof full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment\\nsomething like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant\\nsuperintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov’s disrespect, still fuming\\nand obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the\\nunfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in\\nwith an exceedingly silly smile.\\n\\n“You shameful hussy!” he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The\\nlady in mourning had left the office.) “What was going on at your house\\nlast night? Eh! A disgrace again, you’re a scandal to the whole street.\\nFighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,\\nI have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the\\neleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!”\\n\\nThe paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked wildly at the\\nsmart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it\\nmeant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He\\nlistened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his\\nnerves were on edge.\\n\\n“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped\\nshort, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not\\nbe stopped except by force.\\n\\nAs for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the\\nstorm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of\\nabuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the\\nsmiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and\\ncurtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her\\nword: and at last she found it.\\n\\n“There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,” she\\npattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,\\nthough with a strong German accent, “and no sort of scandal, and his\\nhonour came drunk, and it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,\\nand I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\\nand honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any\\nscandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles\\nagain, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte\\nwith one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and\\nhe _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said\\nso. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then\\nI called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the\\neye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the\\ncheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\\nand I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in\\nthe window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of\\nsquealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!\\nAnd Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,\\nMr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_\\npay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five\\nroubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused\\nall the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, ‘for I can write to all\\nthe papers about you.’”\\n\\n“Then he was an author?”\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable\\nhouse....”\\n\\n“Now then! Enough! I have told you already...”\\n\\n“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk repeated significantly.\\n\\nThe assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his\\nhead.\\n\\n“... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it\\nyou for the last time,” the assistant went on. “If there is a scandal\\nin your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the\\nlock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary\\nman, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable\\nhouse’? A nice set, these authors!”\\n\\nAnd he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. “There was a scandal\\nthe other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and\\nwould not pay; ‘I’ll write a satire on you,’ says he. And there was\\nanother of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful\\nlanguage to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and\\ndaughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner’s shop\\nthe other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,\\ntown-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one\\nday. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?”\\n\\nWith hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all\\ndirections, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she\\nstumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open\\nface and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of\\nthe district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste\\nto curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she\\nfluttered out of the office.\\n\\n“Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya\\nPetrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. “You are aroused again, you are\\nfuming again! I heard it on the stairs!”\\n\\n“Well, what then!” Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;\\nand he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of\\nhis shoulders at each step. “Here, if you will kindly look: an author,\\nor a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given\\nan I O U, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly\\nbeing lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest\\nagainst my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and\\njust look at him, please. Here’s the gentleman, and very attractive he\\nis!”\\n\\n“Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,\\nyou can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and\\nwent too far yourself,” continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to\\nRaskolnikov. “But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure\\nyou, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no\\nstopping him! And then it’s all over! And at the bottom he’s a heart of\\ngold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....”\\n\\n“And what a regiment it was, too,” cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified\\nat this agreeable banter, though still sulky.\\n\\nRaskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant\\nto them all. “Excuse me, Captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing\\nNikodim Fomitch, “will you enter into my position?... I am ready to\\nask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick\\nand shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not\\nstudying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I\\nhave a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to\\nme, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so\\nexasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the\\nlast four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I\\ndon’t understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this\\nI O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!...”\\n\\n“But that is not our business, you know,” the head clerk was observing.\\n\\n“Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain...”\\n Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying\\nhis best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently\\nappeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously\\noblivious of him. “Allow me to explain that I have been living with her\\nfor nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not\\nconfess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it\\nwas a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked\\nher, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...\\nthat is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those\\ndays, and I led a life of... I was very heedless...”\\n\\n“Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to\\nwaste,” Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;\\nbut Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it\\nexceedingly difficult to speak.\\n\\n“But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all\\nhappened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.\\nBut a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as\\nbefore, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said\\nto me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,\\nbut still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen\\nroubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,\\nshe would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,\\nnever--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay\\nof myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to\\neat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?”\\n\\n“All these affecting details are no business of ours.” Ilya Petrovitch\\ninterrupted rudely. “You must give a written undertaking but as for your\\nlove affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Come now... you are harsh,” muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at\\nthe table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.\\n\\n“Write!” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Write what?” the latter asked, gruffly.\\n\\n“I will dictate to you.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and\\ncontemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt\\ncompletely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took\\nplace in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,\\nhe would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like\\nthat a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had\\nthose feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not\\nwith police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he\\nwould not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A\\ngloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took\\nconscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental\\neffusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter’s\\ntriumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.\\nOh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty\\nvanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been\\nsentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would\\nhardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to\\nhim entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but\\nhe felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could\\nnever more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental\\neffusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that\\nif they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,\\nit would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any\\ncircumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful\\nsensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a\\nconception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the\\nsensations he had known in his life.\\n\\nThe head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,\\nthat he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that\\nhe would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.\\n\\n“But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,” observed the head\\nclerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. “Are you ill?”\\n\\n“Yes, I am giddy. Go on!”\\n\\n“That’s all. Sign it.”\\n\\nThe head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.\\n\\nRaskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,\\nhe put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He\\nfelt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea\\nsuddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim\\nFomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then\\nto go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole\\nin the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat\\nto carry it out. “Hadn’t I better think a minute?” flashed through his\\nmind. “No, better cast off the burden without thinking.” But all at once\\nhe stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly\\nwith Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:\\n\\n“It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, the whole\\nstory contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it\\nhad been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,\\nthat would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at\\nthe gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking\\nwith three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the\\nporters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he\\nhave asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for\\nKoch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went\\nup to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now\\njust consider...”\\n\\n“But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state\\nthemselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes\\nlater when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was\\nunfastened.”\\n\\n“That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself\\nin; and they’d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been\\nan ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the\\ninterval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing\\nhimself and saying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and\\nkilled me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,\\nha!”\\n\\n“And no one saw the murderer?”\\n\\n“They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah’s Ark,” said\\nthe head clerk, who was listening.\\n\\n“It’s clear, quite clear,” Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.\\n\\n“No, it is anything but clear,” Ilya Petrovitch maintained.\\n\\nRaskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did\\nnot reach it....\\n\\nWhen he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,\\nsupported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing\\non the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and\\nNikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up\\nfrom the chair.\\n\\n“What’s this? Are you ill?” Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.\\n\\n“He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,” said the head clerk,\\nsettling back in his place, and taking up his work again.\\n\\n“Have you been ill long?” cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where\\nhe, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at\\nthe sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.\\n\\n“Since yesterday,” muttered Raskolnikov in reply.\\n\\n“Did you go out yesterday?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Though you were ill?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“At what time?”\\n\\n“About seven.”\\n\\n“And where did you go, may I ask?”\\n\\n“Along the street.”\\n\\n“Short and clear.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,\\nwithout dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch’s stare.\\n\\n“He can scarcely stand upright. And you...” Nikodim Fomitch was\\nbeginning.\\n\\n“No matter,” Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.\\n\\nNikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at\\nthe head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. There\\nwas a sudden silence. It was strange.\\n\\n“Very well, then,” concluded Ilya Petrovitch, “we will not detain you.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his\\ndeparture, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim\\nFomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.\\n\\n“A search--there will be a search at once,” he repeated to himself,\\nhurrying home. “The brutes! they suspect.”\\n\\nHis former terror mastered him completely again.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n“And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my\\nroom?”\\n\\nBut here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.\\nEven Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left\\nall those things in the hole?\\n\\nHe rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the\\nthings out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in\\nall: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly\\nlooked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,\\nmerely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked\\nlike a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his\\novercoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal\\nthem as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of\\nhis room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and\\nthough he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of\\npursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an\\nhour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at\\nall costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything\\nup while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....\\nWhere was he to go?\\n\\nThat had long been settled: “Fling them into the canal, and all traces\\nhidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.” So he had decided in\\nthe night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to\\nget up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get\\nrid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along\\nthe bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked\\nseveral times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not\\nthink of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge,\\nand women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and\\npeople were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed\\nfrom the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go\\ndown on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if\\nthe boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.\\nEven as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if\\nthey had nothing to do but to watch him. “Why is it, or can it be my\\nfancy?” he thought.\\n\\nAt last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the\\nNeva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,\\nand it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further\\noff. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,\\nworried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it\\nbefore. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply\\nbecause he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent\\nand forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\\n\\nHe walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way\\nanother idea struck him. “Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go\\nsomewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things\\nin some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot\\nperhaps?” And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea\\nseemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For\\ncoming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a\\npassage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right\\nhand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far\\ninto the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for\\ntwenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here\\nwas a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was\\nlying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,\\napparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It\\nwas probably a carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place\\nfrom the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to\\nthrow it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and\\nat once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\\nthere are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had\\nbeen scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, “Standing here\\nstrictly forbidden.” This was all the better, for there would be nothing\\nsuspicious about his going in. “Here I could throw it all in a heap and\\nget away!”\\n\\nLooking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed\\nagainst the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn\\nstone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a\\nstreet. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he\\ncould not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the\\nstreet, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.\\n\\nHe bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,\\nand using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small\\nhollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.\\nThe purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he\\nseized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was\\nin the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But\\nhe scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.\\nNothing could be noticed.\\n\\nThen he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,\\nalmost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in\\nthe police-office. “I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of\\nlooking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since\\nthe house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were\\nfound, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!” And he laughed.\\nYes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless\\nlaugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But\\nwhen he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come\\nupon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his\\nmind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat\\non which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it\\nwould be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had\\ngiven the twenty copecks: “Damn him!”\\n\\nHe walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now\\nseemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there\\nreally was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that\\npoint--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.\\n\\n“Damn it all!” he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.\\n“If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how\\nstupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned\\nupon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I\\ncare for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It\\nis not that at all!”\\n\\nSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple\\nquestion perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\\n\\n“If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if\\nI really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even\\nglance into the purse and don’t know what I had there, for which I have\\nundergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,\\nfilthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the\\nwater the purse together with all the things which I had not seen\\neither... how’s that?”\\n\\nYes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and\\nit was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night\\nwithout hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though\\nit could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and\\nunderstood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the\\nmoment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out\\nof it.... Yes, so it was.\\n\\n“It is because I am very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “I have been\\nworrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know what I am doing....\\nYesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been\\nworrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what\\nif I don’t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!”\\n\\nHe walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some\\ndistraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new\\noverwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him\\nevery moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\\neverything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.\\nAll who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their\\nmovements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he\\nmight have spat at him or bitten him....\\n\\nHe stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near\\nthe bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. “Why, he lives here, in that house,”\\n he thought, “why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here\\nit’s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;\\nhave I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never\\nmind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the\\nday _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further\\nnow.”\\n\\nHe went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.\\n\\nThe latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and\\nhe opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each\\nother. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on\\nhis bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\\n\\n“Is it you?” he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a\\nbrief pause, he whistled. “As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you’ve\\ncut me out!” he added, looking at Raskolnikov’s rags. “Come sit down,\\nyou are tired, I’ll be bound.”\\n\\nAnd when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was\\nin even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his\\nvisitor was ill.\\n\\n“Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?” He began feeling his\\npulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\\n\\n“Never mind,” he said, “I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I\\nwanted,... but I don’t really want lessons....”\\n\\n“But I say! You are delirious, you know!” Razumihin observed, watching\\nhim carefully.\\n\\n“No, I am not.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to\\nRazumihin’s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend\\nface to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all\\ndisposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the\\nwide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at\\nhimself as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold.\\n\\n“Good-bye,” he said abruptly, and walked to the door.\\n\\n“Stop, stop! You queer fish.”\\n\\n“I don’t want to,” said the other, again pulling away his hand.\\n\\n“Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this\\nis... almost insulting! I won’t let you go like that.”\\n\\n“Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could\\nhelp... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I\\nmean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?\\nNothing at all... no one’s services... no one’s sympathy. I am by\\nmyself... alone. Come, that’s enough. Leave me alone.”\\n\\n“Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all\\nI care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don’t care about that, but\\nthere’s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.\\nI would not exchange him for five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a\\nkind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they\\nhave! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I\\nwas a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!\\nNow he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of\\nanything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of\\nthe German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses\\nthe question, ‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly\\nproves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a\\ncontribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand\\nthese two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous\\ntitle half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He\\npays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles\\nfor the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we have finished\\nthis, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of\\nthe dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have\\nmarked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was\\na kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang him!\\nWell, would you like to do the second signature of ‘_Is woman a human\\nbeing?_’ If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those\\nare provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in\\nadvance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.\\nAnd when you have finished the signature there will be another three\\nroubles for you. And please don’t think I am doing you a service; quite\\nthe contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to\\nbegin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly\\nadrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.\\nThe only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better.\\nThough who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. Will you take\\nit?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles\\nand without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.\\nBut when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the\\nstairs to Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German article\\nand the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.\\n\\n“Are you raving, or what?” Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.\\n“What farce is this? You’ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to\\nsee me for, damn you?”\\n\\n“I don’t want... translation,” muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.\\n\\n“Then what the devil do you want?” shouted Razumihin from above.\\nRaskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.\\n\\n“Hey, there! Where are you living?”\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\n“Well, confound you then!”\\n\\nBut Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky\\nBridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant\\nincident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him\\na violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under\\nhis horses’ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the\\nrailing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle\\nof the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.\\nHe heard laughter, of course.\\n\\n“Serves him right!”\\n\\n“A pickpocket I dare say.”\\n\\n“Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on\\npurpose; and you have to answer for him.”\\n\\n“It’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.”\\n\\nBut while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered\\nafter the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt\\nsomeone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman\\nin a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter,\\nwearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.\\n\\n“Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.”\\n\\nHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From\\nhis dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar\\nasking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he\\ndoubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.\\n\\nHe closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and\\nturned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without\\na cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the\\nNeva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the\\nbridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,\\nand in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.\\nThe pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one\\nuneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood\\nstill, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was\\nespecially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had\\nhundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,\\ngazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at\\na vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely\\ncold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered\\nevery time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting\\nhimself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled\\nthose old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was\\nno mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and\\ngrotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,\\nas though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be\\ninterested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...\\nso short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his\\nheart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him\\nnow--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,\\nhis old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He\\nfelt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing\\nfrom his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he\\nsuddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his\\nhand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into\\nthe water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut\\nhimself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\\n\\nEvening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been\\nwalking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.\\nUndressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the\\nsofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....\\n\\nIt was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a\\nscream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,\\nblows and curses he had never heard.\\n\\nHe could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he\\nsat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing\\nand cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement\\nhe caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and\\nwailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make\\nout what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\\nbeaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of\\nher assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost\\na croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly\\nand indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov\\ntrembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.\\nIlya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,\\nbanging her head against the steps--that’s clear, that can be told\\nfrom the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world\\ntopsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys\\nand all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors\\nbanging. “But why, why, and how could it be?” he repeated, thinking\\nseriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And\\nthey would come to him then next, “for no doubt... it’s all about\\nthat... about yesterday.... Good God!” He would have fastened his door\\nwith the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would\\nbe useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed\\nhim.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\\nbegan gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya\\nPetrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,\\ntoo, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. “Can he have\\ngone away? Good Lord!” Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still\\nweeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was\\ngoing from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling\\nto one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a\\nwhisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates\\nof the block. “But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come\\nhere!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He\\nlay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of\\ninfinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright\\nlight flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate\\nof soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not\\nasleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she\\nhad brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.\\n\\n“You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You’ve been trudging\\nabout all day, and you’re shaking with fever.”\\n\\n“Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?”\\n\\nShe looked intently at him.\\n\\n“Who beat the landlady?”\\n\\n“Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant\\nsuperintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,\\nand... why was he here?”\\n\\nNastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a\\nlong time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.\\n\\n“Nastasya, why don’t you speak?” he said timidly at last in a weak\\nvoice.\\n\\n“It’s the blood,” she answered at last softly, as though speaking to\\nherself.\\n\\n“Blood? What blood?” he muttered, growing white and turning towards the\\nwall.\\n\\nNastasya still looked at him without speaking.\\n\\n“Nobody has been beating the landlady,” she declared at last in a firm,\\nresolute voice.\\n\\nHe gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.\\n\\n“I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up,” he\\nsaid still more timidly. “I listened a long while. The assistant\\nsuperintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the\\nflats.”\\n\\n“No one has been here. That’s the blood crying in your ears. When\\nthere’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying\\nthings.... Will you eat something?”\\n\\nHe made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.\\n\\n“Give me something to drink... Nastasya.”\\n\\nShe went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.\\nHe remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling\\nsome on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nHe was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he\\nwas in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.\\nHe remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though\\nthere were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away\\nsomewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about\\nhim. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid\\nof him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;\\nthey threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked\\nat him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished\\nanother person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could\\nnot remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.\\nSometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times\\nit all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had\\nno recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten\\nsomething he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying\\nto remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable\\nterror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone\\nalways prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and\\nforgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.\\n\\nIt happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone\\ninto the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right\\nwall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him\\nwith another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him\\nvery inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,\\nshort-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was\\npeeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.\\n\\n“Who is this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing to the young man.\\n\\n“I say, he’s himself again!” she said.\\n\\n“He is himself,” echoed the man.\\n\\nConcluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the\\ndoor and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or\\ndiscussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat\\nand buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and\\nlaziness, and absurdly bashful.\\n\\n“Who... are you?” he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment\\nthe door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,\\nRazumihin came in.\\n\\n“What a cabin it is!” he cried. “I am always knocking my head. You call\\nthis a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I’ve just heard the news\\nfrom Pashenka.”\\n\\n“He has just come to,” said Nastasya.\\n\\n“Just come to,” echoed the man again, with a smile.\\n\\n“And who are you?” Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. “My name is\\nVrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but\\nVrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are\\nyou?”\\n\\n“I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and\\nI’ve come on business.”\\n\\n“Please sit down.” Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the\\ntable. “It’s a good thing you’ve come to, brother,” he went on to\\nRaskolnikov. “For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk\\nanything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see\\nyou twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at\\nonce it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.\\nSome nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not\\nhad enough beer and radish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you\\nwill be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a\\nname. Come, I won’t keep you,” he said, addressing the man again. “Will\\nyou explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time\\nthey have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I\\ntalked to him. Who was it came before?”\\n\\n“That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,\\nsir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too.”\\n\\n“He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.”\\n\\n“Quite so; go on.”\\n\\n“At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom\\nI presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you\\nfrom our office,” the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. “If you are in\\nan intelligible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as\\nSemyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma’s\\nrequest instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you\\nknow him, sir?”\\n\\n“Yes, I remember... Vahrushin,” Raskolnikov said dreamily.\\n\\n“You hear, he knows Vahrushin,” cried Razumihin. “He is in ‘an\\nintelligible condition’! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,\\nit’s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.”\\n\\n“That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request\\nof your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the\\nsame manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent\\ninstructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you\\nthirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.”\\n\\n“That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve said, though\\n‘your mamma’ is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully\\nconscious, eh?”\\n\\n“That’s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.”\\n\\n“He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?”\\n\\n“Yes, here’s the book.”\\n\\n“Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll hold you. Take the pen and\\nscribble ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeter\\nto us than treacle.”\\n\\n“I don’t want it,” said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.\\n\\n“Not want it?”\\n\\n“I won’t sign it.”\\n\\n“How the devil can you do without signing it?”\\n\\n“I don’t want... the money.”\\n\\n“Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, I bear witness.\\nDon’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on his travels again. But\\nthat’s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of\\njudgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his\\nhand and he will sign it. Here.”\\n\\n“But I can come another time.”\\n\\n“No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,\\nRodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,” and he made\\nready to hold Raskolnikov’s hand in earnest.\\n\\n“Stop, I’ll do it alone,” said the latter, taking the pen and signing\\nhis name.\\n\\nThe messenger took out the money and went away.\\n\\n“Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Is there any soup?”\\n\\n“Some of yesterday’s,” answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.\\n\\n“With potatoes and rice in it?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea.”\\n\\n“Very well.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,\\nunreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what\\nwould happen. “I believe I am not wandering. I believe it’s reality,” he\\nthought.\\n\\nIn a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced\\nthat the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two\\nspoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The\\ntable was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.\\n\\n“It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us\\nup a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them.”\\n\\n“Well, you are a cool hand,” muttered Nastasya, and she departed to\\ncarry out his orders.\\n\\nRaskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile\\nRazumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his\\nleft arm round Raskolnikov’s head, although he was able to sit up, and\\nwith his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that\\nit might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov\\nswallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after\\ngiving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and\\nsaid that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.\\n\\nNastasya came in with two bottles of beer.\\n\\n“And will you have tea?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on\\nwithout the faculty. But here is the beer!” He moved back to his chair,\\npulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he\\nhad not touched food for three days.\\n\\n“I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,” he\\nmumbled with his mouth full of beef, “and it’s all Pashenka, your dear\\nlittle landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I\\ndon’t ask for it, but, of course, I don’t object. And here’s Nastasya\\nwith the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have\\nsome beer?”\\n\\n“Get along with your nonsense!”\\n\\n“A cup of tea, then?”\\n\\n“A cup of tea, maybe.”\\n\\n“Pour it out. Stay, I’ll pour it out myself. Sit down.”\\n\\nHe poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As\\nbefore, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up\\nand gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and\\nearnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective\\nmeans towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made\\nno resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa\\nwithout support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but\\neven perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost\\nanimal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying\\nlow for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession\\nof his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.\\nYet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen\\nspoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away\\ncapriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real\\npillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed\\nthat, too, and took note of it.\\n\\n“Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some\\nraspberry tea,” said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking\\nhis soup and beer again.\\n\\n“And where is she to get raspberries for you?” asked Nastasya, balancing\\na saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of\\nsugar.\\n\\n“She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things\\nhave been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in\\nthat rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I\\nresolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.\\nHow I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had\\nforgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know\\nit; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the\\nFive Corners, Harlamov’s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov’s\\nhouse, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but\\nBuch’s. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I\\nwent on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in\\ntwo minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.”\\n\\n“My name!”\\n\\n“I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while\\nI was there. Well, it’s a long story. But as soon as I did land on this\\nplace, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know\\neverything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of\\nNikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.\\nZametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,\\nand, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....”\\n\\n“He’s got round her,” Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.\\n\\n“Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?”\\n\\n“You are a one!” Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. “I am\\nnot Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,” she added suddenly, recovering from her\\nmirth.\\n\\n“I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,\\nI was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant\\ninfluences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not\\nexpected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you\\nthink?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,\\nfull of alarm.\\n\\n“And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,” Razumihin went\\non, not at all embarrassed by his silence.\\n\\n“Ah, the sly dog!” Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded\\nher unspeakable delight.\\n\\n“It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way\\nat first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so\\nto speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her\\ncharacter later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that\\nshe gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been\\nmad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,\\nNatalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that’s\\na delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of\\nfoolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as\\nyou would think at first sight?”\\n\\n“No,” mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better\\nto keep up the conversation.\\n\\n“She isn’t, is she?” cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out\\nof him. “But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,\\nessentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,\\nI assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and\\nof course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her\\nintellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a\\nsort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!\\nI don’t understand it! Well, that’s all nonsense. Only, seeing that you\\nare not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and\\nthat through the young lady’s death she has no need to treat you as\\na relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and\\ndropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.\\nAnd she’s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose\\nthe I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.”\\n\\n“It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost\\na beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,”\\n Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.\\n\\n“Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point\\nMr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have\\nthought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but\\nthe business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the\\nquestion, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,\\nbecause he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and\\ntwenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,\\ntoo, who would go into bondage for his sake. That’s what he was building\\nupon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs\\nnow, my dear boy--it’s not for nothing that you were so open with\\nPashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as\\na friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is\\nopen; and a business man ‘listens and goes on eating’ you up. Well,\\nthen she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without\\nhesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this\\nI wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time\\nharmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping\\nthe whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,\\nbrother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten\\nroubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of\\npresenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I\\nhave torn it.”\\n\\nRazumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and\\nturned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a\\ntwinge.\\n\\n“I see, brother,” he said a moment later, “that I have been playing the\\nfool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe\\nI have only made you cross.”\\n\\n“Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov\\nasked, after a moment’s pause without turning his head.\\n\\n“Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought\\nZametov one day.”\\n\\n“Zametov? The head clerk? What for?” Raskolnikov turned round quickly\\nand fixed his eyes on Razumihin.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to\\nmake your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How\\ncould I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital\\nfellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are\\nfriends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,\\nyou know. I have only just moved. I’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna\\nonce or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?\\n\\n“Did I say anything in delirium?”\\n\\n“I should think so! You were beside yourself.”\\n\\n“What did I rave about?”\\n\\n“What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,\\nbrother, now I must not lose time. To work.” He got up from the table\\nand took up his cap.\\n\\n“What did I rave about?”\\n\\n“How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don’t\\nworry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot\\nabout a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky\\nIsland, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the\\nassistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest\\nto you was your own sock. You whined, ‘Give me my sock.’ Zametov\\nhunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,\\nring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you\\ncomforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched\\nthing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely\\nsomewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so\\npiteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort\\nof fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are\\nthirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account\\nof them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,\\nthough he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And\\nyou, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he\\nwants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted\\nmyself. Good-bye!”\\n\\n“He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a deep one!” said Nastasya as he went\\nout; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist\\nrunning downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would\\nsay to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.\\n\\nNo sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the\\nbedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching\\nimpatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to\\nwork. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.\\n\\n“Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What\\nif they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,\\nand then they will come in and tell me that it’s been discovered long\\nago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That’s what I’ve\\nforgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered\\na minute ago.”\\n\\nHe stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment\\nabout him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not\\nwhat he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to\\nthe corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,\\nput his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the\\nstove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of\\nhis trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as\\nhe had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock\\nabout which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on\\nthe sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that\\nZametov could not have seen anything on it.\\n\\n“Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police\\noffice? Where’s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I\\nlooked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But\\nwhat did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?” he muttered,\\nhelplessly sitting on the sofa again. “What does it mean? Am I still in\\ndelirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must\\nescape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but\\nwhere? And where are my clothes? I’ve no boots. They’ve taken them away!\\nThey’ve hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that\\nover! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here’s the I O U...\\nI’ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won’t find\\nme!... Yes, but the address bureau? They’ll find me, Razumihin will find\\nme. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them\\ndo their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What\\nelse shall I take? They think I am ill! They don’t know that I can walk,\\nha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If\\nonly I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch\\nthere--policemen! What’s this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a\\nbottle, cold!”\\n\\nHe snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and\\ngulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.\\nBut in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and\\neven pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the\\nquilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more\\ndisconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With\\na sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more\\nclosely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,\\nragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing\\nsleep.\\n\\nHe woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw\\nRazumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or\\nnot. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though\\ntrying to recall something.\\n\\n“Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!”\\n Razumihin shouted down the stairs. “You shall have the account\\ndirectly.”\\n\\n“What time is it?” asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.\\n\\n“Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, it will be six\\no’clock directly. You have slept more than six hours.”\\n\\n“Good heavens! Have I?”\\n\\n“And why not? It will do you good. What’s the hurry? A tryst, is it?\\nWe’ve all time before us. I’ve been waiting for the last three hours for\\nyou; I’ve been up twice and found you asleep. I’ve called on Zossimov\\ntwice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And\\nI’ve been out on my own business, too. You know I’ve been moving to-day,\\nmoving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that’s\\nno matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it\\ndirectly. And how do you feel now, brother?”\\n\\n“I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?”\\n\\n“I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours.”\\n\\n“No, before.”\\n\\n“How do you mean?”\\n\\n“How long have you been coming here?”\\n\\n“Why I told you all about it this morning. Don’t you remember?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could\\nnot remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.\\n\\n“Hm!” said the latter, “he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were\\nnot quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really\\nlook much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear\\nboy.”\\n\\nHe began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.\\n\\n“Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we\\nmust make a man of you. Let’s begin from the top. Do you see this\\ncap?” he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and\\nordinary cap. “Let me try it on.”\\n\\n“Presently, afterwards,” said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.\\n\\n“Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and\\nI shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.\\nJust right!” he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, “just your size! A\\nproper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in\\nits own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off\\nhis pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other\\npeople wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish\\npoliteness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of his bird’s nest;\\nhe is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of\\nheadgear: this Palmerston”--he took from the corner Raskolnikov’s old,\\nbattered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--“or\\nthis jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,\\nNastasya!” he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not\\nspeak.\\n\\n“Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,” answered Nastasya.\\n\\n“Twenty copecks, silly!” he cried, offended. “Why, nowadays you would\\ncost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been\\nworn. And it’s bought on condition that when’s it’s worn out, they will\\ngive you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to\\nthe United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure\\nyou I am proud of these breeches,” and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a\\npair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. “No holes, no\\nspots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat\\nto match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an\\nimprovement, it’s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,\\nthe great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the\\nseasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep\\nyour money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase. It’s\\nsummer now, so I’ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be\\nwanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...\\nespecially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of\\ncoherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What\\ndo you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:\\nif you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only\\ndo business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a thing once,\\nyou are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your\\nown free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are\\na bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, for it’s foreign work\\nand foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last\\nweek--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.\\nPrice--a rouble and a half. A bargain?”\\n\\n“But perhaps they won’t fit,” observed Nastasya.\\n\\n“Not fit? Just look!” and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov’s\\nold, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. “I did not go\\nempty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.\\nAnd as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin\\nwith are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well\\nnow then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the\\nsuit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the\\nboots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles\\nfifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were\\nbought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.\\nForty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,\\nyou are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will\\nserve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one’s\\nclothes from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and other things, I leave them\\nto you; we’ve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying\\nfor your lodging, don’t you worry. I tell you she’ll trust you for\\nanything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you\\nwill throw off your illness with your shirt.”\\n\\n“Let me be! I don’t want to!” Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened\\nwith disgust to Razumihin’s efforts to be playful about his purchases.\\n\\n“Come, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been trudging around for nothing,”\\n Razumihin insisted. “Nastasya, don’t be bashful, but help me--that’s\\nit,” and in spite of Raskolnikov’s resistance he changed his linen. The\\nlatter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.\\n\\n“It will be long before I get rid of them,” he thought. “What money was\\nall that bought with?” he asked at last, gazing at the wall.\\n\\n“Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your\\nmother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?”\\n\\n“I remember now,” said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.\\nRazumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.\\n\\nThe door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar\\nto Raskolnikov came in.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nZossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face\\nand straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on\\nhis fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable\\nloose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,\\nfashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his\\nwatch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,\\nnonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made\\nefforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every\\ninstant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever\\nat his work.\\n\\n“I’ve been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he’s come to himself,”\\n cried Razumihin.\\n\\n“I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?” said Zossimov to\\nRaskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the\\nsofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.\\n\\n“He is still depressed,” Razumihin went on. “We’ve just changed his\\nlinen and he almost cried.”\\n\\n“That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish\\nit.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?”\\n\\n“I am well, I am perfectly well!” Raskolnikov declared positively\\nand irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with\\nglittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to\\nthe wall. Zossimov watched him intently.\\n\\n“Very good.... Going on all right,” he said lazily. “Has he eaten\\nanything?”\\n\\nThey told him, and asked what he might have.\\n\\n“He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of\\ncourse, you must not give him; he’d better not have meat either, and...\\nbut no need to tell you that!” Razumihin and he looked at each\\nother. “No more medicine or anything. I’ll look at him again to-morrow.\\nPerhaps, to-day even... but never mind...”\\n\\n“To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,” said Razumihin. “We are\\ngoing to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal.”\\n\\n“I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don’t know... a little,\\nmaybe... but we’ll see.”\\n\\n“Ach, what a nuisance! I’ve got a house-warming party to-night; it’s\\nonly a step from here. Couldn’t he come? He could lie on the sofa. You\\nare coming?” Razumihin said to Zossimov. “Don’t forget, you promised.”\\n\\n“All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?”\\n\\n“Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just our\\nfriends.”\\n\\n“And who?”\\n\\n“All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and\\nhe is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some\\nbusiness of his. We meet once in five years.”\\n\\n“What is he?”\\n\\n“He’s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a\\nlittle pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I\\nam fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation\\nDepartment here... But you know him.”\\n\\n“Is he a relation of yours, too?”\\n\\n“A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled\\nonce, won’t you come then?”\\n\\n“I don’t care a damn for him.”\\n\\n“So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a\\ngovernment clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov.”\\n\\n“Do tell me, please, what you or he”--Zossimov nodded at\\nRaskolnikov--“can have in common with this Zametov?”\\n\\n“Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,\\nas it were by springs; you won’t venture to turn round on your own\\naccount. If a man is a nice fellow, that’s the only principle I go upon.\\nZametov is a delightful person.”\\n\\n“Though he does take bribes.”\\n\\n“Well, he does! and what of it? I don’t care if he does take bribes,”\\n Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. “I don’t praise him for\\ntaking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one\\nlooks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure\\nI shouldn’t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown\\nin.”\\n\\n“That’s too little; I’d give two for you.”\\n\\n“And I wouldn’t give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!\\nZametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him\\nnot repel him. You’ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially\\na boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive\\ndullards! You don’t understand. You harm yourselves running another man\\ndown.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common.”\\n\\n“I should like to know what.”\\n\\n“Why, it’s all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of\\na mess! Though indeed there’s nothing to fear now. The matter is\\nabsolutely self-evident. We only put on steam.”\\n\\n“A painter?”\\n\\n“Why, haven’t I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then\\nabout the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed\\nup in it...”\\n\\n“Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...\\npartly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers, too....”\\n\\n“Lizaveta was murdered, too,” Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing\\nRaskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door\\nlistening.\\n\\n“Lizaveta,” murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.\\n\\n“Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn’t you know her? She used to come\\nhere. She mended a shirt for you, too.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he\\npicked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began\\nexamining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the\\npetals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless\\nas though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared\\nobstinately at the flower.\\n\\n“But what about the painter?” Zossimov interrupted Nastasya’s chatter\\nwith marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.\\n\\n“Why, he was accused of the murder,” Razumihin went on hotly.\\n\\n“Was there evidence against him then?”\\n\\n“Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that’s what we\\nhave to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and\\nPestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it’s all done, it makes one\\nsick, though it’s not one’s business! Pestryakov may be coming\\nto-night.... By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already;\\nit happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the\\npolice office while they were talking about it.”\\n\\nZossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.\\n\\n“But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!”\\n Zossimov observed.\\n\\n“Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,” shouted Razumihin,\\nbringing his fist down on the table. “What’s the most offensive is not\\ntheir lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,\\nfor it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship\\ntheir own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at\\nfirst? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter\\nit was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the\\nmurderers--that was their logic!”\\n\\n“But don’t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not\\nhelp that.... And, by the way, I’ve met that man Koch. He used to buy\\nunredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?”\\n\\n“Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession\\nof it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It’s their\\nsickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means\\nof introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data\\nalone how to get on the track of the real man. ‘We have facts,’ they\\nsay. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in\\nhow you interpret them!”\\n\\n“Can you interpret them, then?”\\n\\n“Anyway, one can’t hold one’s tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible\\nfeeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the\\ndetails of the case?”\\n\\n“I am waiting to hear about the painter.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! Well, here’s the story. Early on the third day after the\\nmurder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they\\naccounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an\\nunexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a\\ndram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s\\ncase containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. ‘The\\nday before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’--mark the day and the\\nhour!--‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me\\nalready that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and\\nasked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got\\nthem, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him\\nanything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. ‘I gave him a note’--a\\nrouble that is--‘for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would\\nwith another. It would all come to the same thing--he’d spend it on\\ndrink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it\\nthe quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any\\nrumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all taradiddle;\\nhe lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and\\na receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a\\nthirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply\\nafraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known\\nthis peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same\\nprovince and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men. And though\\nNikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that\\nhouse, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.\\nAs soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,\\ntook his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.\\nAnd the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and\\nher sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt\\nsuspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman\\nlent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful\\ninquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, “Is\\nNikolay here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he\\nhad come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,\\nand went out again. Dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the\\njob alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on\\nthe second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to\\nanyone’--that’s Dushkin’s tale--‘but I found out what I could about\\nthe murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight\\no’clock this morning’--that was the third day, you understand--‘I saw\\nNikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could\\nunderstand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not\\nspeak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep\\non a bench and our two boys. “Have you seen Dmitri?” said I. “No, I\\nhaven’t,” said he. “And you’ve not been here either?” “Not since the day\\nbefore yesterday,” said he. “And where did you sleep last night?”\\n “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” “And where did you get those\\near-rings?” I asked. “I found them in the street,” and the way he said\\nit was a bit queer; he did not look at me. “Did you hear what happened\\nthat very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?” said I.\\n“No,” said he, “I had not heard,” and all the while he was listening,\\nhis eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I\\ntold him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted\\nto keep him. “Wait a bit, Nikolay,” said I, “won’t you have a drink?”\\n And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the\\nbar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.\\nI have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his\\ndoing, as clear as could be....’”\\n\\n“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\\n\\n“Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;\\nthey detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;\\nthe Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before\\nyesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He\\nhad gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram\\nfor it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went\\nto the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable\\nadjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a\\nblock of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman\\nscreeched her hardest; people ran in. ‘So that’s what you are up to!’\\n‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll confess\\neverything.’ Well, they took him to that police station--that is\\nhere--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old\\nhe is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. At the question, ‘When you were working\\nwith Dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a\\ntime?’--answer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did\\nnot notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?’\\n‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same\\nday Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I\\nnever knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy\\nPavlovitch the day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the\\near-rings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement.’ ‘Why didn’t you go to work\\nwith Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘And where were\\nyou drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such a place.’ ‘Why did you run away\\nfrom Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because I was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were\\nyou frightened of?’ ‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be\\nfrightened, if you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not\\nbelieve me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it\\nfor a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?”\\n\\n“Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.”\\n\\n“I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,\\nof their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed\\nhim and he confessed: ‘I did not find it in the street, but in the flat\\nwhere I was painting with Dmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and\\nI were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and\\nDmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.\\nI ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I\\nran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen\\nwere there I don’t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other\\nporter swore, too, and the porter’s wife came out, and swore at us, too;\\nand a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,\\ntoo, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri’s\\nhair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught\\nme by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper\\nbut in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into\\nthe street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back\\nto the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them\\ntogether, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the\\ncorner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped\\nup in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,\\nand in the box were the ear-rings....’”\\n\\n“Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?” Raskolnikov\\ncried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he\\nslowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.\\n\\n“Yes... why? What’s the matter? What’s wrong?” Razumihin, too, got up\\nfrom his seat.\\n\\n“Nothing,” Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were\\nsilent for a while.\\n\\n“He must have waked from a dream,” Razumihin said at last, looking\\ninquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.\\n\\n“Well, go on,” said Zossimov. “What next?”\\n\\n“What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and\\neverything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got\\na rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and\\nwent off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:\\n‘I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.’\\n‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ ‘I was frightened.’\\n‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’\\n‘That I should be accused of it.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now\\nwhat do you suppose they deduced from that?”\\n\\n“Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a fact. You\\nwouldn’t have your painter set free?”\\n\\n“Now they’ve simply taken him for the murderer. They haven’t a shadow of\\ndoubt.”\\n\\n“That’s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You\\nmust admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old\\nwoman’s box have come into Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there\\nsomehow. That’s a good deal in such a case.”\\n\\n“How did they get there? How did they get there?” cried Razumihin.\\n“How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more\\nopportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail\\nto see the character of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at\\nonce that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy\\ntruth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped\\non the box and picked it up.”\\n\\n“The holy truth! But didn’t he own himself that he told a lie at first?”\\n\\n“Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov\\nand the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who\\nwas sitting in the porter’s lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got\\nout of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his\\narm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on\\nthe ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his\\nhair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the\\nthoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they ‘like children’\\n(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,\\nsquealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing\\none another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful\\nnote. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they\\nfound them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open\\nthe boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one\\nquestion: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish\\nscuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,\\nrobbery? They’d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for\\nthe bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing\\nthat people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they\\nrolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.\\nAnd there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!”\\n\\n“Of course it is strange! It’s impossible, indeed, but...”\\n\\n“No, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay’s\\nhands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important\\npiece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation\\ngiven by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously\\nagainst him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him\\ninnocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And\\ndo you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will\\naccept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting\\nsimply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively\\nbreaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they\\nwon’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found the jewel-case\\nand the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he could not have done if he\\nhadn’t felt guilty.’ That’s the point, that’s what excites me, you must\\nunderstand!”\\n\\n“Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof\\nis there that the box came from the old woman?”\\n\\n“That’s been proved,” said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.\\n“Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who\\nproved conclusively that it was his.”\\n\\n“That’s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time\\nthat Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no\\nevidence about that?”\\n\\n“Nobody did see him,” Razumihin answered with vexation. “That’s the\\nworst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way\\nupstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.\\nThey said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going\\non in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether\\nthere actually were men at work in it.”\\n\\n“Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating\\none another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...\\nHow do you explain the facts yourself?”\\n\\n“How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It’s clear. At any\\nrate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and\\nthe jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.\\nThe murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked\\nat the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the\\nmurderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of\\nescape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when\\nNikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the\\nporter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of\\nhearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri\\nand Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;\\npossibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going\\nin and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when\\nhe stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he\\nhad other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that\\nhe did stand there.... That’s how I explain it.”\\n\\n“Too clever! No, my boy, you’re too clever. That beats everything.”\\n\\n“But, why, why?”\\n\\n“Why, because everything fits too well... it’s too melodramatic.”\\n\\n“A-ach!” Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened\\nand a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nThis was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,\\nand a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the\\ndoorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,\\nas though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.\\nMistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost\\naffronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow “cabin.” With the\\nsame amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,\\nunwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with\\nthe same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and\\nunshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the\\nface without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a\\ncouple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting\\ntook place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,\\nthat he would get nothing in this “cabin” by attempting to overawe them,\\nthe gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,\\nemphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:\\n\\n“Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?”\\n\\nZossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not\\nRazumihin anticipated him.\\n\\n“Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?”\\n\\nThis familiar “what do you want” seemed to cut the ground from the\\nfeet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked\\nhimself in time and turned to Zossimov again.\\n\\n“This is Raskolnikov,” mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he\\ngave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he\\nlazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold\\nwatch in a round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly\\nand lazily proceeded to put it back.\\n\\nRaskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing\\npersistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that\\nhis face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it\\nwas extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just\\nundergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But\\nthe new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,\\nthen suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said “This is Raskolnikov”\\n he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but\\nweak and breaking, voice articulated:\\n\\n“Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?”\\n\\nThe visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:\\n\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name\\nis not wholly unknown to you?”\\n\\nBut Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed\\nblankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the\\nname of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.\\n\\n“Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no\\ninformation?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.\\n\\nIn reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands\\nbehind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into\\nLuzhin’s face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively\\nthan ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.\\n\\n“I had presumed and calculated,” he faltered, “that a letter posted more\\nthan ten days, if not a fortnight ago...”\\n\\n“I say, why are you standing in the doorway?” Razumihin interrupted\\nsuddenly. “If you’ve something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so\\ncrowded. Nastasya, make room. Here’s a chair, thread your way in!”\\n\\nHe moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the\\ntable and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the\\nvisitor to “thread his way in.” The minute was so chosen that it was\\nimpossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying\\nand stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at\\nRazumihin.\\n\\n“No need to be nervous,” the latter blurted out. “Rodya has been ill for\\nthe last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and\\nhas got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.\\nI am a comrade of Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am\\nnursing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with your\\nbusiness.”\\n\\n“Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and\\nconversation?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.\\n\\n“N-no,” mumbled Zossimov; “you may amuse him.” He yawned again.\\n\\n“He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,” went on\\nRazumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature\\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,\\nbecause this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a\\nstudent.\\n\\n“Your mamma,” began Luzhin.\\n\\n“Hm!” Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him\\ninquiringly.\\n\\n“That’s all right, go on.”\\n\\nLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in\\nher neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to\\nelapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully\\nassured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my\\nastonishment...”\\n\\n“I know, I know!” Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.\\n“So you are the _fiancé_? I know, and that’s enough!”\\n\\nThere was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being offended this time,\\nbut he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all\\nmeant. There was a moment’s silence.\\n\\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he\\nanswered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as\\nthough he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something\\nnew had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at\\nhim. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole\\nappearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” so\\nunceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far\\ntoo much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few\\ndays in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation\\nof his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,\\nindeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the\\nagreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such\\ncircumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of\\nfiancé. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all\\nright, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even\\nthe stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch\\ntreated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The\\nexquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,\\nif only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in\\nhis hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr\\nPetrovitch’s attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,\\nlight thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a\\ncravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best\\nof it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even\\nhandsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.\\nHis dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,\\ngrowing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,\\ntouched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled\\nat a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair\\nusually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.\\nIf there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather\\ngood-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other\\ncauses. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled\\nmalignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as\\nbefore.\\n\\nBut Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no\\nnotice of their oddities.\\n\\n“I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,” he began,\\nagain breaking the silence with an effort. “If I had been aware of your\\nillness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I\\nhave, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention\\nother preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your\\nmamma and sister any minute.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed\\nsome excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing\\nfollowed, he went on:\\n\\n“... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.”\\n\\n“Where?” asked Raskolnikov weakly.\\n\\n“Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.”\\n\\n“That’s in Voskresensky,” put in Razumihin. “There are two storeys of\\nrooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve been there.”\\n\\n“Yes, rooms...”\\n\\n“A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of doubtful\\ncharacter. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer\\npeople living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It’s\\ncheap, though...”\\n\\n“I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger\\nin Petersburg myself,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. “However, the\\ntwo rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...\\nI have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,” he said,\\naddressing Raskolnikov, “and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am\\nmyself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch\\nLebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me\\nof Bakaleyev’s house, too...”\\n\\n“Lebeziatnikov?” said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.\\n\\n“Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you\\nknow him?”\\n\\n“Yes... no,” Raskolnikov answered.\\n\\n“Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....\\nA very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one\\nlearns new things from them.” Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.\\n\\n“How do you mean?” asked Razumihin.\\n\\n“In the most serious and essential matters,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\\nas though delighted at the question. “You see, it’s ten years since I\\nvisited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in\\nthe provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.\\nAnd it’s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the\\nyounger generation. And I confess I am delighted...”\\n\\n“At what?”\\n\\n“Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find\\nclearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...”\\n\\n“That’s true,” Zossimov let drop.\\n\\n“Nonsense! There’s no practicality.” Razumihin flew at him.\\n“Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from\\nheaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from\\nall practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to\\nPyotr Petrovitch, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish\\nform, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.\\nAnyway, there’s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.”\\n\\n“I don’t agree with you,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident\\nenjoyment. “Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,\\nbut one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of\\nenthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little\\nhas been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.\\nIt’s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been\\naccomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are\\ncirculating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.\\nLiterature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been\\nrooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves\\noff irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great\\nthing...”\\n\\n“He’s learnt it by heart to show off!” Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.\\n\\n“What?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received\\nno reply.\\n\\n“That’s all true,” Zossimov hastened to interpose.\\n\\n“Isn’t it so?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.\\n“You must admit,” he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of\\ntriumph and superciliousness--he almost added “young man”--“that there\\nis an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and\\neconomic truth...”\\n\\n“A commonplace.”\\n\\n“No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, ‘love\\nthy neighbour,’ what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with\\nexcessive haste. “It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my\\nneighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has\\nit, ‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells\\nus, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on\\nself-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly\\nand your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private\\naffairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the\\nfirmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare\\norganised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for\\nmyself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to\\npass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not\\nfrom private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general\\nadvance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time\\nreaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it\\nwould seem to want very little wit to perceive it...”\\n\\n“Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,” Razumihin cut in sharply,\\n“and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I’ve\\ngrown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse\\noneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,\\nby Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a\\nhurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you,\\nthat’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you\\nare, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive\\ncause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything\\nthey touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That’s\\nenough!”\\n\\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive\\ndignity. “Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too...”\\n\\n“Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that’s enough,” Razumihin\\nconcluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous\\nconversation.\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up\\nhis mind to take leave in another minute or two.\\n\\n“I trust our acquaintance,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov, “may, upon\\nyour recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,\\nbecome closer... Above all, I hope for your return to health...”\\n\\nRaskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting\\nup from his chair.\\n\\n“One of her customers must have killed her,” Zossimov declared\\npositively.\\n\\n“Not a doubt of it,” replied Razumihin. “Porfiry doesn’t give his\\nopinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there.”\\n\\n“Examining them?” Raskolnikov asked aloud.\\n\\n“Yes. What then?”\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n“How does he get hold of them?” asked Zossimov.\\n\\n“Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the\\nwrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.”\\n\\n“It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!\\nThe coolness!”\\n\\n“That’s just what it wasn’t!” interposed Razumihin. “That’s what throws\\nyou all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not\\npractised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that\\nit was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn’t work. Suppose\\nhim to have been inexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance\\nthat saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee\\nobstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth\\nten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the\\nold woman’s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,\\nbesides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know\\nhow to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,\\nhis first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good\\ncounsel!”\\n\\n“You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?” Pyotr\\nPetrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves\\nin hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more\\nintellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable\\nimpression and his vanity overcame his prudence.\\n\\n“Yes. You’ve heard of it?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“Do you know the details?”\\n\\n“I can’t say that; but another circumstance interests me in the\\ncase--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime\\nhas been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last\\nfive years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,\\nwhat strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,\\ntoo, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a\\nstudent’s robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of\\ngood social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole\\ngang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of\\nthe ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary\\nabroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old\\nwoman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class\\nin society--for peasants don’t pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain\\nthis demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?”\\n\\n“There are many economic changes,” put in Zossimov.\\n\\n“How are we to explain it?” Razumihin caught him up. “It might be\\nexplained by our inveterate impracticality.”\\n\\n“How do you mean?”\\n\\n“What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he\\nwas forging notes? ‘Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I\\nwant to make haste to get rich too.’ I don’t remember the exact words,\\nbut the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or\\nworking! We’ve grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking\\non crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour\\nstruck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours.”\\n\\n     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.\\n     --TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.\\n\\n“But morality? And so to speak, principles...”\\n\\n“But why do you worry about it?” Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. “It’s\\nin accordance with your theory!”\\n\\n“In accordance with my theory?”\\n\\n“Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and\\nit follows that people may be killed...”\\n\\n“Upon my word!” cried Luzhin.\\n\\n“No, that’s not so,” put in Zossimov.\\n\\nRaskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing\\npainfully.\\n\\n“There’s a measure in all things,” Luzhin went on superciliously.\\n“Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to\\nsuppose...”\\n\\n“And is it true,” Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a\\nvoice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, “is it true that\\nyou told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what\\npleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better\\nto raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over\\nher, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with\\nconfusion, “to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to\\nassure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,\\nhas been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect\\nwho... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed\\nto me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat\\nhigh-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles\\nfrom supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in\\nso fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed...”\\n\\n“I tell you what,” cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and\\nfixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, “I tell you what.”\\n\\n“What?” Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.\\nSilence lasted for some seconds.\\n\\n“Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my\\nmother... I shall send you flying downstairs!”\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you?” cried Razumihin.\\n\\n“So that’s how it is?” Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. “Let me tell\\nyou, sir,” he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself\\nbut breathing hard, “at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed\\nto me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive\\na great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after\\nthis...”\\n\\n“I am not ill,” cried Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“So much the worse...”\\n\\n“Go to hell!”\\n\\nBut Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing\\nbetween the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him\\npass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who\\nhad for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,\\nhe went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid\\ncrushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of\\nhis spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.\\n\\n“How could you--how could you!” Razumihin said, shaking his head in\\nperplexity.\\n\\n“Let me alone--let me alone all of you!” Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.\\n“Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am\\nnot afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,\\nalone, alone!”\\n\\n“Come along,” said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.\\n\\n“But we can’t leave him like this!”\\n\\n“Come along,” Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin\\nthought a minute and ran to overtake him.\\n\\n“It might be worse not to obey him,” said Zossimov on the stairs. “He\\nmustn’t be irritated.”\\n\\n“What’s the matter with him?”\\n\\n“If only he could get some favourable shock, that’s what would do it! At\\nfirst he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some\\nfixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!”\\n\\n“Perhaps it’s that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation\\nI gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a\\nletter about it just before his illness....”\\n\\n“Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have\\nyou noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to\\nanything except one point on which he seems excited--that’s the murder?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” Razumihin agreed, “I noticed that, too. He is interested,\\nfrightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police\\noffice; he fainted.”\\n\\n“Tell me more about that this evening and I’ll tell you something\\nafterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I’ll go and see\\nhim again.... There’ll be no inflammation though.”\\n\\n“Thanks! And I’ll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him\\nthrough Nastasya....”\\n\\nRaskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,\\nbut she still lingered.\\n\\n“Won’t you have some tea now?” she asked.\\n\\n“Later! I am sleepy! Leave me.”\\n\\nHe turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nBut as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the\\nparcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again\\nand began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become\\nperfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic\\nfear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange\\nsudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was\\nevident in them. “To-day, to-day,” he muttered to himself. He understood\\nthat he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him\\nstrength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not\\nfall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he\\nlooked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought\\nput it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the\\ncopper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.\\nThen he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and\\nglanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back\\nto him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. She heard nothing. Who would\\nhave dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the\\nstreet.\\n\\nIt was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as\\nbefore, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head\\nfelt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his\\nfeverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and\\ndid not think where he was going, he had one thought only: “that all\\n_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would\\nnot return home without it, because he _would not go on living like\\nthat_.” How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,\\nhe did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought\\ntortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be\\nchanged “one way or another,” he repeated with desperate and immovable\\nself-confidence and determination.\\n\\nFrom old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay\\nMarket. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in\\nthe road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very\\nsentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood\\non the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a\\nmantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very\\nold and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and\\ncoarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from\\nthe shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five\\ncopeck piece and put it in the girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a\\nsentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder “Come on,”\\n and both moved on to the next shop.\\n\\n“Do you like street music?” said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged\\nman standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.\\n\\n“I love to hear singing to a street organ,” said Raskolnikov, and his\\nmanner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“I like it\\non cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the\\npassers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet\\nsnow is falling straight down, when there’s no wind--you know what I\\nmean?--and the street lamps shine through it...”\\n\\n“I don’t know.... Excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the\\nquestion and Raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the\\nother side of the street.\\n\\nRaskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay\\nMarket, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but\\nthey were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round\\nand addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a\\ncorn chandler’s shop.\\n\\n“Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?”\\n\\n“All sorts of people keep booths here,” answered the young man, glancing\\nsuperciliously at Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“What’s his name?”\\n\\n“What he was christened.”\\n\\n“Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?”\\n\\nThe young man looked at Raskolnikov again.\\n\\n“It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously\\nforgive me, your excellency!”\\n\\n“Is that a tavern at the top there?”\\n\\n“Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and you’ll find\\nprincesses there too.... La-la!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd\\nof peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking\\nat the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into\\nconversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they\\nwere all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and\\ntook a turning to the right in the direction of V.\\n\\nHe had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading\\nfrom the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn\\nto wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might\\nfeel more so.\\n\\nNow he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great\\nblock of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;\\nwomen were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their\\nindoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,\\nespecially about the entrances to various festive establishments in\\nthe lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the\\ntinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.\\nA crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the\\nsteps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken\\nsoldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,\\nswearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had\\nforgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead\\ndrunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of\\nwomen, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore\\ncotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some\\nnot more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.\\n\\nHe felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and\\nuproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing\\nfrantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar\\nand of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,\\ngloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping\\ninquisitively in from the pavement.\\n\\n  “Oh, my handsome soldier\\n   Don’t beat me for nothing,”\\n\\ntrilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to\\nmake out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.\\n\\n“Shall I go in?” he thought. “They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get\\ndrunk?”\\n\\n“Won’t you come in?” one of the women asked him. Her voice was\\nstill musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not\\nrepulsive--the only one of the group.\\n\\n“Why, she’s pretty,” he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.\\n\\nShe smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\\n\\n“You’re very nice looking yourself,” she said.\\n\\n“Isn’t he thin though!” observed another woman in a deep bass. “Have you\\njust come out of a hospital?”\\n\\n“They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub\\nnoses,” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing\\na loose coat. “See how jolly they are.”\\n\\n“Go along with you!”\\n\\n“I’ll go, sweetie!”\\n\\nAnd he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.\\n\\n“I say, sir,” the girl shouted after him.\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\nShe hesitated.\\n\\n“I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but\\nnow I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there’s a nice young\\nman!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.\\n\\n“Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!”\\n\\n“What’s your name?”\\n\\n“Ask for Duclida.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s too much,” one of the women observed, shaking her head\\nat Duclida. “I don’t know how you can ask like that. I believe I should\\ndrop with shame....”\\n\\nRaskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench\\nof thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made\\nher criticism quietly and earnestly. “Where is it,” thought Raskolnikov.\\n“Where is it I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,\\nan hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,\\non such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, and the ocean,\\neverlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around\\nhim, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his\\nlife, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die\\nat once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...\\nHow true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile\\nis he who calls him vile for that,” he added a moment later.\\n\\nHe went into another street. “Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin\\nwas just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it\\nI wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he’d read it in the\\npapers. Have you the papers?” he asked, going into a very spacious and\\npositively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,\\nhowever, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a\\nroom further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov\\nfancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that\\ndistance. “What if it is?” he thought.\\n\\n“Will you have vodka?” asked the waiter.\\n\\n“Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last\\nfive days, and I’ll give you something.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s. No vodka?”\\n\\nThe old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and\\nbegan to look through them.\\n\\n“Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a\\nstaircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire\\nin Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the\\nPetersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....\\nAh, here it is!” He found at last what he was seeking and began to\\nread it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began\\neagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands\\nshook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone\\nsat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk\\nZametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the\\nwatch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the\\nsmart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good\\nhumour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark\\nface was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.\\n\\n“What, you here?” he began in surprise, speaking as though he’d known\\nhim all his life. “Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were\\nunconscious. How strange! And do you know I’ve been to see you?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and\\nturned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of\\nirritable impatience was apparent in that smile.\\n\\n“I know you have,” he answered. “I’ve heard it. You looked for my\\nsock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says\\nyou’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s--you know, the woman you tried\\nto befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he\\nwould not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to\\nunderstand--it was quite clear, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n“What a hot head he is!”\\n\\n“The explosive one?”\\n\\n“No, your friend Razumihin.”\\n\\n“You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most\\nagreeable places. Who’s been pouring champagne into you just now?”\\n\\n“We’ve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring\\nit into me!”\\n\\n“By way of a fee! You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s\\nall right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. “I\\nam not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that\\nworkman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of\\nthe old woman....”\\n\\n“How do you know about it?”\\n\\n“Perhaps I know more about it than you do.”\\n\\n“How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You\\noughtn’t to have come out.”\\n\\n“Oh, do I seem strange to you?”\\n\\n“Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“There’s a lot about the fires.”\\n\\n“No, I am not reading about the fires.” Here he looked mysteriously at\\nZametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. “No, I am not\\nreading about the fires,” he went on, winking at Zametov. “But confess\\nnow, my dear fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading\\nabout?”\\n\\n“I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do you keep\\non...?”\\n\\n“Listen, you are a man of culture and education?”\\n\\n“I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” said Zametov with some\\ndignity.\\n\\n“Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you\\nare a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!” Here Raskolnikov\\nbroke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov’s face. The latter drew\\nback, more amazed than offended.\\n\\n“Foo! how strange you are!” Zametov repeated very seriously. “I can’t\\nhelp thinking you are still delirious.”\\n\\n“I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You\\nfind me curious, do you?”\\n\\n“Yes, curious.”\\n\\n“Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See\\nwhat a lot of papers I’ve made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?”\\n\\n“Well, what is it?”\\n\\n“You prick up your ears?”\\n\\n“How do you mean--‘prick up my ears’?”\\n\\n“I’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,\\nbetter ‘I confess’... No, that’s not right either; ‘I make a deposition\\nand you take it.’ I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and\\nsearching....” he screwed up his eyes and paused. “I was searching--and\\ncame here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old\\npawnbroker woman,” he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing\\nhis face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him\\nsteadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov\\nafterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for\\nexactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.\\n\\n“What if you have been reading about it?” he cried at last, perplexed\\nand impatient. “That’s no business of mine! What of it?”\\n\\n“The same old woman,” Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not\\nheeding Zametov’s explanation, “about whom you were talking in the\\npolice-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understand\\nnow?”\\n\\n“What do you mean? Understand... what?” Zametov brought out, almost\\nalarmed.\\n\\nRaskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he\\nsuddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though\\nutterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with\\nextraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that\\nmoment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch\\ntrembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden\\ndesire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at\\nthem, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!\\n\\n“You are either mad, or...” began Zametov, and he broke off, as though\\nstunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.\\n\\n“Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!”\\n\\n“Nothing,” said Zametov, getting angry, “it’s all nonsense!”\\n\\nBoth were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became\\nsuddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and\\nleaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten\\nZametov. The silence lasted for some time.\\n\\n“Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,” said Zametov.\\n\\n“What! Tea? Oh, yes....” Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of\\nbread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember\\neverything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face\\nresumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.\\n\\n“There have been a great many of these crimes lately,” said Zametov.\\n“Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of\\nfalse coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They\\nused to forge tickets!”\\n\\n“Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,”\\n Raskolnikov answered calmly. “So you consider them criminals?” he added,\\nsmiling.\\n\\n“Of course they are criminals.”\\n\\n“They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred\\npeople meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too\\nmany, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in\\nthemselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.\\nSimpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what\\na thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these\\nsimpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the\\nrest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his\\nlife! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change\\nthe notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand\\nroubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,\\nbut did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the\\nmoney into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And\\nthe whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?”\\n\\n“That his hands trembled?” observed Zametov, “yes, that’s quite\\npossible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can’t\\nstand things.”\\n\\n“Can’t stand that?”\\n\\n“Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the sake of a hundred\\nroubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes\\ninto a bank where it’s their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I\\nshould not have the face to do it. Would you?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov had an intense desire again “to put his tongue out.” Shivers\\nkept running down his spine.\\n\\n“I should do it quite differently,” Raskolnikov began. “This is how I\\nwould change the notes: I’d count the first thousand three or four times\\nbackwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I’d set to the\\nsecond thousand; I’d count that half-way through and then hold some\\nfifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light\\nagain--to see whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, ‘a\\nrelation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a\\nfalse note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole story. And after I began\\ncounting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I would say, ‘I fancy I made a\\nmistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.’\\nAnd so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and\\nso on to the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from the\\nfifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light\\nand ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew\\nthat he would not know how to get rid of me. When I’d finished and had\\ngone out, I’d come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation.\\nThat’s how I’d do it.”\\n\\n“Foo! what terrible things you say!” said Zametov, laughing. “But all\\nthat is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you’d make a slip.\\nI believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on\\nhimself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old\\nwoman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a\\ndesperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by\\na miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the\\nplace, he couldn’t stand it. That was clear from the...”\\n\\nRaskolnikov seemed offended.\\n\\n“Clear? Why don’t you catch him then?” he cried, maliciously gibing at\\nZametov.\\n\\n“Well, they will catch him.”\\n\\n“Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You’ve a tough job! A\\ngreat point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had\\nno money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any\\nchild can mislead you.”\\n\\n“The fact is they always do that, though,” answered Zametov. “A man will\\ncommit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes\\ndrinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all\\nas cunning as you are. You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.\\n\\n“You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should\\nbehave in that case, too?” he asked with displeasure.\\n\\n“I should like to,” Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too\\nmuch earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.\\n\\n“Very much?”\\n\\n“Very much!”\\n\\n“All right then. This is how I should behave,” Raskolnikov began, again\\nbringing his face close to Zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking\\nin a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. “This is what\\nI should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should\\nhave walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place\\nwith fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden\\nor place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone\\nweighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from\\nthe time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure\\nto be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that\\nhole. Then I’d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,\\nwould press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,\\nthree maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There’d\\nbe no trace.”\\n\\n“You are a madman,” said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a\\nwhisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He\\nhad turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.\\nHe bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move\\nwithout uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he\\nwas doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on\\nhis lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break\\nout, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.\\n\\n“And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?” he said\\nsuddenly and--realised what he had done.\\n\\nZametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His\\nface wore a contorted smile.\\n\\n“But is it possible?” he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked\\nwrathfully at him.\\n\\n“Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?”\\n\\n“Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,” Zametov cried\\nhastily.\\n\\n“I’ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you\\nbelieve less than ever?”\\n\\n“Not at all,” cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. “Have you been\\nfrightening me so as to lead up to this?”\\n\\n“You don’t believe it then? What were you talking about behind my\\nback when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive\\nlieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,” he shouted to the\\nwaiter, getting up and taking his cap, “how much?”\\n\\n“Thirty copecks,” the latter replied, running up.\\n\\n“And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!” he\\nheld out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. “Red notes and\\nblue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new\\nclothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You’ve cross-examined my\\nlandlady, I’ll be bound.... Well, that’s enough! _Assez causé!_ Till we\\nmeet again!”\\n\\nHe went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical\\nsensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he\\nwas gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.\\nHis fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation\\nstimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as\\nquickly when the stimulus was removed.\\n\\nZametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in\\nthought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on\\na certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.\\n\\n“Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,” he decided.\\n\\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he\\nstumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other\\ntill they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood\\nlooking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then\\nanger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.\\n\\n“So here you are!” he shouted at the top of his voice--“you ran away\\nfrom your bed! And here I’ve been looking for you under the sofa! We\\nwent up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here\\nhe is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole\\ntruth! Confess! Do you hear?”\\n\\n“It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,”\\n Raskolnikov answered calmly.\\n\\n“Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a\\nsheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing\\nin the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!”\\n\\n“Let me go!” said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much\\nfor Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.\\n\\n“Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I’ll do\\nwith you directly? I’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you\\nhome under my arm and lock you up!”\\n\\n“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t\\nyou see that I don’t want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to\\nshower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in\\nfact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I\\nwas very glad to die. Didn’t I tell you plainly enough to-day that\\nyou were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to\\ntorture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my\\nrecovery, because it’s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov\\nwent away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for\\ngoodness’ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don’t\\nyou see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can\\nI persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be\\nungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God’s sake, let me be!\\nLet me be, let me be!”\\n\\nHe began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was\\nabout to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had\\nbeen with Luzhin.\\n\\nRazumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.\\n\\n“Well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully. “Stay,” he\\nroared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. “Listen to me. Let me tell\\nyou, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you’ve any\\nlittle trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are\\nplagiarists even in that! There isn’t a sign of independent life in\\nyou! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you’ve lymph in your veins\\ninstead of blood. I don’t believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances\\nthe first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!” he\\ncried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making\\na movement--“hear me out! You know I’m having a house-warming this\\nevening, I dare say they’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I\\njust ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren’t a fool, a common\\nfool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...\\nyou see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a\\nfool!--and if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening\\ninstead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone\\nout, there’s no help for it! I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady\\nhas one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any\\nway you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“R-rubbish!” Razumihin shouted, out of patience. “How do you know?\\nYou can’t answer for yourself! You don’t know anything about it....\\nThousands of times I’ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back\\nto them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So\\nremember, Potchinkov’s house on the third storey....”\\n\\n“Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you’d let anybody beat you from sheer\\nbenevolence.”\\n\\n“Beat? Whom? Me? I’d twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkov’s\\nhouse, 47, Babushkin’s flat....”\\n\\n“I shall not come, Razumihin.” Raskolnikov turned and walked away.\\n\\n“I bet you will,” Razumihin shouted after him. “I refuse to know you if\\nyou don’t! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Did you see him?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Talked to him?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“What about? Confound you, don’t tell me then. Potchinkov’s house, 47,\\nBabushkin’s flat, remember!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.\\nRazumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he\\nwent into the house but stopped short of the stairs.\\n\\n“Confound it,” he went on almost aloud. “He talked sensibly but yet...\\nI am a fool! As if madmen didn’t talk sensibly! And this was just what\\nZossimov seemed afraid of.” He struck his finger on his forehead. “What\\nif... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,\\nwhat a blunder! I can’t.” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but\\nthere was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to\\nthe Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.\\n\\nRaskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and\\nleaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting\\nwith Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this\\nplace. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending\\nover the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the\\nsunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at\\none distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in\\nthe last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,\\nand the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed\\nbefore his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal\\nbanks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,\\nsaved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He\\nbecame aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked\\nand saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,\\nwasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but\\nobviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her\\nright hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then\\nher left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and\\nswallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning\\nwoman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head\\nand legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.\\n\\n“A woman drowning! A woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people\\nran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people\\ncrowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.\\n\\n“Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!” a woman cried tearfully close by.\\n“Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!”\\n\\n“A boat, a boat” was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a\\nboat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great\\ncoat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:\\nshe floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of\\nher clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a\\ncomrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They\\nlaid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered\\nconsciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,\\nstupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\\n\\n“She’s drunk herself out of her senses,” the same woman’s voice wailed\\nat her side. “Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang\\nherself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little\\ngirl to look after her--and here she’s in trouble again! A neighbour,\\ngentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,\\nsee yonder....”\\n\\nThe crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone\\nmentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange\\nsensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. “No, that’s\\nloathsome... water... it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself.\\n“Nothing will come of it,” he added, “no use to wait. What about the\\npolice office...? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The police\\noffice is open till ten o’clock....” He turned his back to the railing\\nand looked about him.\\n\\n“Very well then!” he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and\\nwalked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and\\nempty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there\\nwas not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “to make an\\nend of it all.” Complete apathy had succeeded to it.\\n\\n“Well, it’s a way out of it,” he thought, walking slowly and listlessly\\nalong the canal bank. “Anyway I’ll make an end, for I want to.... But\\nis it a way out? What does it matter! There’ll be the square yard of\\nspace--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or\\nnot? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie\\ndown soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don’t\\ncare about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one’s head.”\\n\\nTo reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the\\nsecond turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the\\nfirst turning he stopped and, after a minute’s thought, turned into a\\nside street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any\\nobject, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking\\nat the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted\\nhis head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.\\nHe had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.\\nAn overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the\\nhouse, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the\\nright, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.\\nThe narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing\\nand looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework\\nof the window had been taken out. “That wasn’t so then,” he thought.\\nHere was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been\\nworking. “It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So it’s to let.” Then\\nthe third storey and the fourth. “Here!” He was perplexed to find the\\ndoor of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;\\nhe had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last\\nstairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were\\nworkmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he\\nwould find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the\\nsame places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed\\nstrange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There\\nwere two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the\\nother. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with\\nlilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for\\nsome reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper\\nwith dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.\\nThe workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were\\nhurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took\\nno notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov\\nfolded his arms and listened.\\n\\n“She comes to me in the morning,” said the elder to the younger, “very\\nearly, all dressed up. ‘Why are you preening and prinking?’ says I. ‘I\\nam ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of\\ngoing on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!”\\n\\n“And what is a fashion book?” the younger one asked. He obviously\\nregarded the other as an authority.\\n\\n“A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the\\ntailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how\\nto dress, the male sex as well as the female. They’re pictures. The\\ngentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles,\\nthey’re beyond anything you can fancy.”\\n\\n“There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,” the younger cried\\nenthusiastically, “except father and mother, there’s everything!”\\n\\n“Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the elder\\ndeclared sententiously.\\n\\nRaskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,\\nthe bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very\\ntiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the\\ncorner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and\\nwent to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.\\n\\n“What do you want?” he asked suddenly.\\n\\nInstead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the\\nbell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and\\na third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly\\nfearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more\\nvividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\n“Well, what do you want? Who are you?” the workman shouted, going out to\\nhim. Raskolnikov went inside again.\\n\\n“I want to take a flat,” he said. “I am looking round.”\\n\\n“It’s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up\\nwith the porter.”\\n\\n“The floors have been washed, will they be painted?” Raskolnikov went\\non. “Is there no blood?”\\n\\n“What blood?”\\n\\n“Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a\\nperfect pool there.”\\n\\n“But who are you?” the workman cried, uneasy.\\n\\n“Who am I?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You want to know? Come to the police station, I’ll tell you.”\\n\\nThe workmen looked at him in amazement.\\n\\n“It’s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock\\nup,” said the elder workman.\\n\\n“Very well, come along,” said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going\\nout first, he went slowly downstairs. “Hey, porter,” he cried in the\\ngateway.\\n\\nAt the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;\\nthe two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.\\nRaskolnikov went straight up to them.\\n\\n“What do you want?” asked one of the porters.\\n\\n“Have you been to the police office?”\\n\\n“I’ve just been there. What do you want?”\\n\\n“Is it open?”\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\n“Is the assistant there?”\\n\\n“He was there for a time. What do you want?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.\\n\\n“He’s been to look at the flat,” said the elder workman, coming forward.\\n\\n“Which flat?”\\n\\n“Where we are at work. ‘Why have you washed away the blood?’ says he.\\n‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and I’ve come to take it.’\\nAnd he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. ‘Come to the police\\nstation,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave\\nus.”\\n\\nThe porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.\\n\\n“Who are you?” he shouted as impressively as he could.\\n\\n“I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in\\nShil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he\\nknows me.” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not\\nturning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.\\n\\n“Why have you been to the flat?”\\n\\n“To look at it.”\\n\\n“What is there to look at?”\\n\\n“Take him straight to the police station,” the man in the long coat\\njerked in abruptly.\\n\\nRaskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the\\nsame slow, lazy tones:\\n\\n“Come along.”\\n\\n“Yes, take him,” the man went on more confidently. “Why was he going\\ninto _that_, what’s in his mind, eh?”\\n\\n“He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with him,” muttered the\\nworkman.\\n\\n“But what do you want?” the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry\\nin earnest--“Why are you hanging about?”\\n\\n“You funk the police station then?” said Raskolnikov jeeringly.\\n\\n“How funk it? Why are you hanging about?”\\n\\n“He’s a rogue!” shouted the peasant woman.\\n\\n“Why waste time talking to him?” cried the other porter, a huge peasant\\nin a full open coat and with keys on his belt. “Get along! He is a rogue\\nand no mistake. Get along!”\\n\\nAnd seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He\\nlurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in\\nsilence and walked away.\\n\\n“Strange man!” observed the workman.\\n\\n“There are strange folks about nowadays,” said the woman.\\n\\n“You should have taken him to the police station all the same,” said the\\nman in the long coat.\\n\\n“Better have nothing to do with him,” decided the big porter. “A regular\\nrogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you\\nwon’t get rid of him.... We know the sort!”\\n\\n“Shall I go there or not?” thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle\\nof the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as\\nthough expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all\\nwas dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to\\nhim alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards\\naway, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.\\nIn the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the\\nmiddle of the street. “What is it?” Raskolnikov turned to the right\\nand went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled\\ncoldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to\\nthe police station and knew that it would all soon be over.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nAn elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of\\nspirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got\\noff his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....\\nA mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One\\nof them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying\\nclose to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the\\ncoachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:\\n\\n“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last\\nin seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a\\nman who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with\\nblood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was\\nflowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and\\ndisfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\\n\\n“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do? If I’d\\nbeen driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,\\nnot in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody\\nelse. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him\\ncrossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again\\nand a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell\\nstraight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very\\ntipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,\\nhe screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”\\n\\n“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.\\n\\n“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice\\ndeclared.\\n\\n“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.\\n\\nBut the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was\\nevident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who\\nwas awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little\\nanxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to\\ntake the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew\\nhis name.\\n\\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The\\nlantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised\\nhim.\\n\\n“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a\\ngovernment clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close\\nby in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He\\npulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in\\nviolent agitation.\\n\\nThe police were glad that they had found out who the man was.\\nRaskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it\\nhad been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious\\nMarmeladov to his lodging at once.\\n\\n“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to\\nKozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,\\nhe is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one\\ndaughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is\\nsure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will\\nbe looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die\\nbefore you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something\\nunseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward\\nand legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the\\ninjured man; people volunteered to help.\\n\\nKozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,\\ncarefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.\\n\\n“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn\\nround! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free\\nmoment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and\\nback again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself\\nand coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest\\ngirl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not\\nunderstand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so\\nalways watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost\\nto appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little\\nbrother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was\\nwaiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.\\nHe was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,\\nserious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels\\ntogether and toes turned out.\\n\\nHe was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting\\nperfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good\\nlittle boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little\\ngirl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,\\nwaiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve\\nthem a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the\\nother rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,\\nconsumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner\\nduring that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than\\never.\\n\\n“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking\\nabout the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house\\nand how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!\\nPapa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that\\neveryone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,\\nas our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed\\nlife,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her\\nbreast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s...\\nPrincess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father\\nand I were married, Polenka--she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty\\ngirl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend\\nthat tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or\\nto-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger,” she\\narticulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just\\ncome from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to\\nmake me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions\\nand told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your\\nfather, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me\\nthe shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you\\nmust manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out\\nwith it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond\\ndoesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,\\nhe has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to\\nwork two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!\\nWhat’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,\\nwho were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it? What are\\nthey bringing? Mercy on us!”\\n\\n“Where are we to put him?” asked the policeman, looking round when\\nMarmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.\\n\\n“On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,”\\n Raskolnikov showed him.\\n\\n“Run over in the road! Drunk!” someone shouted in the passage.\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The\\nchildren were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and\\nclutched at her, trembling all over.\\n\\nHaving laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.\\n\\n“For God’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!” he said, speaking\\nquickly, “he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don’t\\nbe frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I’ve been\\nhere already, you remember? He will come to; I’ll pay!”\\n\\n“He’s done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she\\nrushed to her husband.\\n\\nRaskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who\\nswoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man’s head a\\npillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining\\nhim. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips\\nand stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.\\n\\nRaskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a\\ndoctor, it appeared, next door but one.\\n\\n“I’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, “don’t be\\nuneasy, I’ll pay. Haven’t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,\\nanything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe\\nme.... We shall see what the doctor says!”\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the\\ncorner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in\\nreadiness for washing her children’s and husband’s linen that night.\\nThis washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a\\nweek, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they\\nwere practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could\\nnot endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she\\npreferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when\\nthe rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry\\nby the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov’s request,\\nbut almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already\\nsucceeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off\\nMarmeladov’s face.\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands\\nto her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began\\nto realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man\\nbrought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.\\n\\n“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste. If you\\ndon’t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over\\nand that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!\\nthere, put on the shawl.”\\n\\n“Run your fastest!” cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after\\nwhich he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his\\nheels thrust forward and his toes spread out.\\n\\nMeanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn’t have\\ndropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a\\ntime, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost\\nall Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms\\nof the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but\\nafterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a\\nfury.\\n\\n“You might let him die in peace, at least,” she shouted at the crowd,\\n“is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,\\ncough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his\\nhat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!”\\n\\nHer cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They\\nevidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after\\nanother, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling\\nof satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden\\naccident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which\\nno living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and\\ncompassion.\\n\\nVoices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying\\nthat they’d no business to make a disturbance here.\\n\\n“No business to die!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to\\nthe door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to\\nface with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident\\nand ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and\\nirresponsible German.\\n\\n“Ah, my God!” she cried, clasping her hands, “your husband drunken\\nhorses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!”\\n\\n“Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,”\\n Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with\\nthe landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not\\ndeny herself this satisfaction). “Amalia Ludwigovna...”\\n\\n“I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may\\nnot dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.”\\n\\n“You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not\\none of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who’s laughing\\nbehind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it\\nagain’ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you\\nAmalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that\\nname. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;\\nhe is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.\\nLet him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,\\nhimself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew\\nme as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been\\na benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many\\nfriends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable\\npride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to\\nRaskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has\\nwealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a\\nchild. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...”\\n\\nAll this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,\\nbut a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence. At that\\ninstant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she\\nran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or\\nunderstanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew\\ndeep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth\\nand drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising\\nRaskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked\\nat him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.\\n\\n“My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,” she said\\nin despair. “We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon\\nZaharovitch, if you can,” she cried to him.\\n\\nMarmeladov recognised her.\\n\\n“A priest,” he articulated huskily.\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window\\nframe and exclaimed in despair:\\n\\n“Oh, cursed life!”\\n\\n“A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence.\\n\\n“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her\\nshout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she\\nreturned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for\\nlong.\\n\\nSoon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in\\nthe corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her\\nwondering childish eyes.\\n\\n“A-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.\\n\\n“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\n\\n“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the\\nchild’s bare feet.\\n\\n“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is\\nbarefooted.”\\n\\n“Thank God, the doctor,” exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.\\n\\nThe doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about\\nhim mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully\\nfelt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the\\nblood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest. It was gashed,\\ncrushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.\\nOn the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking\\nyellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse’s hoof. The doctor\\nfrowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and\\nturned round with it for thirty yards on the road.\\n\\n“It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,” the doctor\\nwhispered softly to Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“What do you think of him?” he asked.\\n\\n“He will die immediately.”\\n\\n“Is there really no hope?”\\n\\n“Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,\\ntoo... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.\\nHe is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.”\\n\\n“Better bleed him then.”\\n\\n“If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.”\\n\\nAt that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,\\nand the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing\\nthe sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.\\nThe doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.\\nRaskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his\\nshoulders and remained.\\n\\nAll stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably\\nunderstood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.\\nKaterina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt\\ndown in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of\\nher. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his\\nlittle bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with\\nprecision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which\\nseemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her\\nlips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling\\nstraight the boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders\\nwith a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her\\nknees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was\\nopened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from\\nall the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not\\nventure beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.\\n\\nAt that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She\\ncame in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for\\nher mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the\\nstreet.” Her mother made her kneel beside her.\\n\\nTimidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,\\nand strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,\\ndeath and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of\\nthe cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,\\nunmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the\\ndoorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.\\nShe forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with\\nits ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the\\nwhole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought\\nwith her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat\\nwith its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat\\nwas a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in\\nterror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather\\npretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the\\npriest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some\\nwords in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a\\nstep forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.\\n\\nThe service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.\\nThe priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and\\nconsolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.\\n\\n“What am I to do with these?” she interrupted sharply and irritably,\\npointing to the little ones.\\n\\n“God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,” the priest began.\\n\\n“Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.”\\n\\n“That’s a sin, a sin, madam,” observed the priest, shaking his head.\\n\\n“And isn’t that a sin?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying\\nman.\\n\\n“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to\\ncompensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”\\n\\n“You don’t understand!” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.\\n“And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself\\nunder the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.\\nHe drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he\\nwasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he’s dying! One\\nless to keep!”\\n\\n“You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, madam, such\\nfeelings are a great sin.”\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,\\nwiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,\\nand had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now\\nshe flew at him almost in a frenzy.\\n\\n“Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d not been run\\nover, he’d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and\\nin rags and he’d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been\\nsousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s\\nand then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I\\nshould have been darning them. That’s how I spend my nights!... What’s\\nthe use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!”\\n\\nA terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief\\nto her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her\\naching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed\\nhis head and said nothing.\\n\\nMarmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face\\nof Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying\\nto say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and\\narticulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\\nwanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\\n\\n“Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!” And the sick man\\nwas silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\\ndoorway and he saw Sonia.\\n\\nTill then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a\\ncorner.\\n\\n“Who’s that? Who’s that?” he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,\\nin agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his\\ndaughter was standing, and trying to sit up.\\n\\n“Lie down! Lie do-own!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\n\\nWith unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his\\nelbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as\\nthough not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.\\nSuddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and\\ngaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying\\nfather. His face showed intense suffering.\\n\\n“Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!” he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand\\nto her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on\\nthe floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he\\nwas dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so\\nwithout moving. He died in her arms.\\n\\n“He’s got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s\\ndead body. “Well, what’s to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can\\nI give them to-morrow to eat?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\\n\\n“Katerina Ivanovna,” he began, “last week your husband told me all his\\nlife and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate\\nreverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you\\nall and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\\nin spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\\nfriends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my\\ndead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any\\nassistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will\\nbe sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....\\nGood-bye!”\\n\\nAnd he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd\\nto the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim\\nFomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions\\nin person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but\\nNikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\\n\\n“Ah, is that you?” he asked him.\\n\\n“He’s dead,” answered Raskolnikov. “The doctor and the priest have been,\\nall as it should have been. Don’t worry the poor woman too much, she is\\nin consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a\\nkind-hearted man, I know...” he added with a smile, looking straight in\\nhis face.\\n\\n“But you are spattered with blood,” observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing\\nin the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov’s waistcoat.\\n\\n“Yes... I’m covered with blood,” Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;\\nthen he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\\n\\nHe walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious\\nof it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and\\nstrength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be\\ncompared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been\\npardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on\\nhis way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting\\nwith him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid\\nfootsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was\\nrunning after him, calling “Wait! wait!”\\n\\nHe turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped\\nshort a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov\\ncould distinguish the child’s thin but pretty little face, looking at\\nhim with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message\\nwhich she was evidently glad to give.\\n\\n“Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?” she said\\nhurriedly in a breathless voice.\\n\\nHe laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of\\nrapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said\\nwhy.\\n\\n“Who sent you?”\\n\\n“Sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.\\n\\n“I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.”\\n\\n“Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,\\ntoo, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’”\\n\\n“Do you love sister Sonia?”\\n\\n“I love her more than anyone,” Polenka answered with a peculiar\\nearnestness, and her smile became graver.\\n\\n“And will you love me?”\\n\\nBy way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching him, her full\\nlips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks\\nheld him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl\\nwept softly, pressing her face against him.\\n\\n“I am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, raising her\\ntear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. “It’s\\nnothing but misfortunes now,” she added suddenly with that peculiarly\\nsedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak\\nlike grown-up people.\\n\\n“Did your father love you?”\\n\\n“He loved Lida most,” she went on very seriously without a smile,\\nexactly like grown-up people, “he loved her because she is little and\\nbecause she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But\\nhe taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,” she added with\\ndignity. “And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she\\nliked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,\\nfor it’s time my education began.”\\n\\n“And do you know your prayers?”\\n\\n“Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself\\nas I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.\\nFirst they repeat the ‘Ave Maria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord,\\nforgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and\\nbless our second father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is\\nanother one, but we do pray for the other as well.”\\n\\n“Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. ‘And Thy\\nservant Rodion,’ nothing more.”\\n\\n“I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,” the little girl declared\\nhotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him\\nwarmly once more.\\n\\nRaskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to\\ncome next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past\\nten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on\\nthe bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.\\n\\n“Enough,” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. “I’ve done with\\nfancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven’t I lived\\njust now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of\\nHeaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the\\nreign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now\\nwe will see! We will try our strength!” he added defiantly, as though\\nchallenging some power of darkness. “And I was ready to consent to live\\nin a square of space!\\n\\n“I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.\\nI knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov’s house\\nis only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if\\nit were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some\\nsatisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you\\ncan get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that’s\\nwhat they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently and\\nhe walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and\\nself-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming\\na different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this\\nrevolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a\\nstraw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there was still\\nlife for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.’ Perhaps he\\nwas in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of\\nthat.\\n\\n“But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers,” the\\nidea struck him. “Well, that was... in case of emergency,” he added and\\nlaughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.\\n\\nHe easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at\\nPotchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way\\nupstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big\\ngathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could\\nhear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the\\ncompany consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,\\nwhere two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two\\nsamovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up\\nfrom the landlady’s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran\\nout delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a\\ngreat deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite\\ndrunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.\\n\\n“Listen,” Raskolnikov hastened to say, “I’ve only just come to tell you\\nyou’ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to\\nhim. I can’t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And\\nso good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Do you know what? I’ll see you home. If you say you’re weak yourself,\\nyou must...”\\n\\n“And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped\\nout?”\\n\\n“He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle’s, I expect, or perhaps\\nhe has come without being invited... I’ll leave uncle with them, he\\nis an invaluable person, pity I can’t introduce you to him now. But\\nconfound them all now! They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh\\nair, for you’ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I\\nshould have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...\\nyou simply can’t imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn’t you\\nimagine? Don’t we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that’s the\\nway to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.”\\n\\nZossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special\\ninterest in him; soon his face brightened.\\n\\n“You must go to bed at once,” he pronounced, examining the patient as\\nfar as he could, “and take something for the night. Will you take it? I\\ngot it ready some time ago... a powder.”\\n\\n“Two, if you like,” answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.\\n\\n“It’s a good thing you are taking him home,” observed Zossimov to\\nRazumihin--“we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he’s not at all\\namiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn...”\\n\\n“Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?”\\n Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. “I won’t tell\\nyou everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me\\nto talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and\\nafterwards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his head\\nthat you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,\\nyou’ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,\\nyou needn’t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,\\nthat piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental\\ndiseases, and what’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your\\nconversation to-day with Zametov.”\\n\\n“Zametov told you all about it?”\\n\\n“Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does\\nZametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little\\ndrunk now.... But that’s... no matter... the point is that this\\nidea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you\\nunderstand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea\\nis too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that\\nbubble’s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave\\nZametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that’s between ourselves,\\nbrother; please don’t let out a hint that you know of it; I’ve noticed\\nhe is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna’s. But to-day, to-day\\nit’s all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He\\ntook advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed\\nof it himself now; I know that...”\\n\\nRaskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too\\nfreely.\\n\\n“I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,” said\\nRaskolnikov.\\n\\n“No need to explain that! And it wasn’t the paint only: the fever had\\nbeen coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed\\nthat boy is now, you wouldn’t believe! ‘I am not worth his little\\nfinger,’ he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,\\nbrother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais\\nde Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,\\nyou know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced\\nhim again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you\\nsuddenly--put out your tongue at him: ‘There now, what do you make of\\nit?’ It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by\\nJove, it’s what they deserve! Ah, that I wasn’t there! He was hoping to\\nsee you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance...”\\n\\n“Ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?”\\n\\n“Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,\\nyou see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it’s\\nclear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and\\nhow that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little\\ndrunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... I\\ntell you, he’s mad on mental diseases. But don’t you mind him...”\\n\\nFor half a minute both were silent.\\n\\n“Listen, Razumihin,” began Raskolnikov, “I want to tell you plainly:\\nI’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... I gave them all my\\nmoney... and besides I’ve just been kissed by someone who, if I had\\nkilled anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else\\nthere... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I\\nam very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...”\\n\\n“What’s the matter? What’s the matter with you?” Razumihin asked\\nanxiously.\\n\\n“I am a little giddy, but that’s not the point, I am so sad, so sad...\\nlike a woman. Look, what’s that? Look, look!”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“Don’t you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack...”\\n\\nThey were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level\\nof the landlady’s door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that\\nthere was a light in Raskolnikov’s garret.\\n\\n“Queer! Nastasya, perhaps,” observed Razumihin.\\n\\n“She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,\\nbut... I don’t care! Good-bye!”\\n\\n“What do you mean? I am coming with you, we’ll come in together!”\\n\\n“I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say\\ngood-bye to you here. So give me your hand, good-bye!”\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you, Rodya?”\\n\\n“Nothing... come along... you shall be witness.”\\n\\nThey began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that\\nperhaps Zossimov might be right after all. “Ah, I’ve upset him with my\\nchatter!” he muttered to himself.\\n\\nWhen they reached the door they heard voices in the room.\\n\\n“What is it?” cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open the\\ndoor; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.\\n\\nHis mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an\\nhour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of\\nthem, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would\\narrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had\\nspent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was\\nstanding before them and had told them everything by now. They were\\nbeside themselves with alarm when they heard of his “running away”\\n to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! “Good\\nHeavens, what had become of him?” Both had been weeping, both had been\\nin anguish for that hour and a half.\\n\\nA cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance. Both rushed to\\nhim. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck\\nhim like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he\\ncould not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,\\nlaughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,\\nfainting.\\n\\nAnxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the\\ndoorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and\\nin a moment had him on the sofa.\\n\\n“It’s nothing, nothing!” he cried to the mother and sister--“it’s only a\\nfaint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better,\\nthat he is perfectly well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he is\\nall right again!”\\n\\nAnd seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made\\nher bend down to see that “he is all right again.” The mother and sister\\nlooked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. They\\nhad heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya\\nduring his illness, by this “very competent young man,” as Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with\\nDounia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART III\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nRaskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly\\nto Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations\\nhe was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand\\nand for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.\\nHis mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion\\nagonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost\\ninsane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\\n\\nAvdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother’s.\\n\\n“Go home... with him,” he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,\\n“good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you\\narrived?”\\n\\n“This evening, Rodya,” answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “the train was\\nawfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! I\\nwill spend the night here, near you...”\\n\\n“Don’t torture me!” he said with a gesture of irritation.\\n\\n“I will stay with him,” cried Razumihin, “I won’t leave him for a\\nmoment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts’ content!\\nMy uncle is presiding there.”\\n\\n“How, how can I thank you!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once\\nmore pressing Razumihin’s hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.\\n\\n“I can’t have it! I can’t have it!” he repeated irritably, “don’t worry\\nme! Enough, go away... I can’t stand it!”\\n\\n“Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,” Dounia\\nwhispered in dismay; “we are distressing him, that’s evident.”\\n\\n“Mayn’t I look at him after three years?” wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“Stay,” he stopped them again, “you keep interrupting me, and my ideas\\nget muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?”\\n\\n“No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,\\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,” Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna added somewhat timidly.\\n\\n“Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d throw him\\ndownstairs and told him to go to hell....”\\n\\n“Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don’t mean to tell us...”\\n Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at\\nDounia.\\n\\nAvdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting\\nfor what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from\\nNastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,\\nand were in painful perplexity and suspense.\\n\\n“Dounia,” Raskolnikov continued with an effort, “I don’t want that\\nmarriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,\\nso that we may never hear his name again.”\\n\\n“Good Heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“Brother, think what you are saying!” Avdotya Romanovna began\\nimpetuously, but immediately checked herself. “You are not fit to talk\\nnow, perhaps; you are tired,” she added gently.\\n\\n“You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_\\nsake. But I won’t accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before\\nto-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will\\nbe the end of it!”\\n\\n“That I can’t do!” the girl cried, offended, “what right have you...”\\n\\n“Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don’t you see...”\\n the mother interposed in dismay. “Better come away!”\\n\\n“He is raving,” Razumihin cried tipsily, “or how would he dare!\\nTo-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did\\ndrive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He made\\nspeeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out\\ncrest-fallen....”\\n\\n“Then it’s true?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,” said Dounia compassionately--“let us\\ngo, mother... Good-bye, Rodya.”\\n\\n“Do you hear, sister,” he repeated after them, making a last effort,\\n“I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like\\na scoundrel, but you mustn’t... one is enough... and though I am a\\nscoundrel, I wouldn’t own such a sister. It’s me or Luzhin! Go now....”\\n\\n“But you’re out of your mind! Despot!” roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov\\ndid not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, and\\nturned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with\\ninterest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively\\nstarted at her glance.\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.\\n\\n“Nothing would induce me to go,” she whispered in despair to Razumihin.\\n“I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home.”\\n\\n“You’ll spoil everything,” Razumihin answered in the same whisper,\\nlosing patience--“come out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a\\nlight! I assure you,” he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--“that\\nhe was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you\\nunderstand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not\\nto irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once\\nand slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this\\ntime of night, and will do himself some mischief....”\\n\\n“What are you saying?”\\n\\n“And Avdotya Romanovna can’t possibly be left in those lodgings without\\nyou. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch\\ncouldn’t find you better lodgings... But you know I’ve had a little to\\ndrink, and that’s what makes me... swear; don’t mind it....”\\n\\n“But I’ll go to the landlady here,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,\\n“I’ll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I\\ncan’t leave him like that, I cannot!”\\n\\nThis conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady’s\\ndoor. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in\\nextraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing\\nRaskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of\\nit himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he\\nhad imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he\\nhad drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with\\nthe two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving\\nthem reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every\\nword he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their\\nhands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the\\nleast regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of\\nhis huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew\\nthem all the closer to him. If they’d told him to jump head foremost\\nfrom the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation\\nin their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man\\nwas really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety\\nover her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was\\nunwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna\\nshared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not\\nsee the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It\\nwas only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her\\nbrother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from\\nhim, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,\\nthat even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,\\nhowever, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of\\nRazumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might\\nbe in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.\\n\\n“You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!” he cried. “If\\nyou stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive him to a frenzy, and\\nthen goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll\\ndo: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you\\ncan’t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that\\nway.... But no matter! Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter of\\nan hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news how he is,\\nwhether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I’ll run home in\\na twinkling--I’ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--I’ll fetch\\nZossimov--that’s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,\\nbut he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I’ll drag him\\nto Rodya, and then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the\\nhour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s a\\nvery different thing from my account of him! If there’s anything wrong,\\nI swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if it’s all right, you go to\\nbed. And I’ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won’t hear me,\\nand I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, to be at hand. Which\\nis better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the\\nlandlady is out of the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of\\nthe question for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s... for she’s a\\nfool... She’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,\\ntoo, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an\\nabsolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...\\nNo matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?”\\n\\n“Let us go, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna, “he will certainly do what\\nhe has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really\\nwill consent to spend the night here, what could be better?”\\n\\n“You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!”\\n Razumihin cried in ecstasy, “let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit\\nwith him with a light; I’ll come in a quarter of an hour.”\\n\\nThough Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no\\nfurther resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down\\nthe stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and\\ngood-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in\\nsuch a condition....\\n\\n“Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!” Razumihin broke in upon\\nher thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge\\nsteps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he\\ndid not observe, however. “Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,\\nbut that’s not it; I am not drunk from wine. It’s seeing you has turned\\nmy head... But don’t mind me! Don’t take any notice: I am talking\\nnonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The\\nminute I’ve taken you home, I’ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over\\nmy head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only\\nyou knew how I love you both! Don’t laugh, and don’t be angry! You may\\nbe angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I\\nam your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year\\nthere was a moment... though it wasn’t a presentiment really, for\\nyou seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan’t sleep all\\nnight... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...\\nthat’s why he mustn’t be irritated.”\\n\\n“What do you say?” cried the mother.\\n\\n“Did the doctor really say that?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.\\n\\n“Yes, but it’s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a\\npowder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been\\nbetter if you had come to-morrow. It’s a good thing we went away. And in\\nan hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not\\ndrunk! And I shan’t be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because\\nthey got me into an argument, damn them! I’ve sworn never to argue! They\\ntalk such trash! I almost came to blows! I’ve left my uncle to preside.\\nWould you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism\\nand that’s just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike\\nthemselves as they can. That’s what they regard as the highest point of\\nprogress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is...”\\n\\n“Listen!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added\\nfuel to the flames.\\n\\n“What do you think?” shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, “you think I\\nam attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk\\nnonsense. That’s man’s one privilege over all creation. Through error\\nyou come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any\\ntruth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and\\nfourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can’t even make\\nmistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,\\nand I’ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one’s own way is better than\\nto go right in someone else’s. In the first case you are a man, in the\\nsecond you’re no better than a bird. Truth won’t escape you, but life\\ncan be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?\\nIn science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,\\njudgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are\\nstill in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other\\npeople’s ideas, it’s what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?” cried\\nRazumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies’ hands.\\n\\n“Oh, mercy, I do not know,” cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“Yes, yes... though I don’t agree with you in everything,” added Avdotya\\nRomanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand\\nso painfully.\\n\\n“Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you...” he cried in\\na transport, “you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and\\nperfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kiss\\nyour hands here at once, on my knees...” and he fell on his knees on the\\npavement, fortunately at that time deserted.\\n\\n“Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\ncried, greatly distressed.\\n\\n“Get up, get up!” said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.\\n\\n“Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That’s it! Enough! I\\nget up and we’ll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and\\ndrunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you, but to do\\nhomage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And\\nI’ve done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya\\nwas right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how\\ndare he put you in such lodgings! It’s a scandal! Do you know the\\nsort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are\\nhis betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I’ll tell you, your _fiancé_ is a\\nscoundrel.”\\n\\n“Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting...” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\nwas beginning.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,”\\n Razumihin made haste to apologise. “But... but you can’t be angry with\\nme for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!\\nThat would be disgraceful; in fact not because I’m in... hm! Well,\\nanyway, I won’t say why, I daren’t.... But we all saw to-day when he\\ncame in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair\\ncurled at the barber’s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his\\nwit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint\\nand a buffoon. That’s evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is a\\nfool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,\\nladies?” he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, “though\\nall my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we\\ndo talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the\\ntruth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...\\nis not on the right path. Though I’ve been calling them all sorts of\\nnames just now, I do respect them all... though I don’t respect Zametov,\\nI like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he\\nis an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it’s all said and\\nforgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let’s go on. I know this corridor,\\nI’ve been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you\\nhere? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.\\nDon’t let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I’ll come back with news,\\nand half an hour later I’ll bring Zossimov, you’ll see! Good-bye, I’ll\\nrun.”\\n\\n“Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?” said Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.\\n\\n“Don’t worry yourself, mother,” said Dounia, taking off her hat and\\ncape. “God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a\\ndrinking party. We can depend on him, I assure you. And all that he has\\ndone for Rodya....”\\n\\n“Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bring\\nmyself to leave Rodya?... And how different, how different I had fancied\\nour meeting! How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us....”\\n\\nTears came into her eyes.\\n\\n“No, it’s not that, mother. You didn’t see, you were crying all the\\ntime. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that’s the reason.”\\n\\n“Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talked\\nto you, Dounia!” said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,\\ntrying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia’s\\nstanding up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven\\nhim. “I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow,” she added,\\nprobing her further.\\n\\n“And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,”\\n Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going\\nbeyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\\nafraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter\\nwarmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait\\nanxiously for Razumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who\\nwalked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.\\nThis walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya\\nRomanovna’s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her\\ndaughter’s mood at such moments.\\n\\nRazumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation\\nfor Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many\\npeople would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya\\nRomanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and\\nfro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was\\nremarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,\\nstrong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every\\ngesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and\\nsoftness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she\\nmight be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a\\nlittle lighter than her brother’s; there was a proud light in her almost\\nblack eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was\\npale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness\\nand vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected\\na little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful\\nface, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty\\nexpression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;\\nbut how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,\\nlaughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,\\nsimple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone\\nlike her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head\\nimmediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the\\nfirst time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at\\nmeeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation\\nat her brother’s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was\\nsealed.\\n\\nHe had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken\\ntalk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov’s eccentric\\nlandlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of\\nAvdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\\nforty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she\\nlooked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the\\ncase with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure\\nsincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to\\npreserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her\\nhair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s\\nfoot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from\\nanxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia\\nover again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and\\nyielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a\\ngreat deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a\\ncertain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions\\nwhich nothing would induce her to cross.\\n\\nExactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, there came two\\nsubdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.\\n\\n“I won’t come in, I haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was\\nopened. “He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may\\nsleep ten hours. Nastasya’s with him; I told her not to leave till I\\ncame. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d\\nbetter turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....”\\n\\nAnd he ran off down the corridor.\\n\\n“What a very competent and... devoted young man!” cried Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna exceedingly delighted.\\n\\n“He seems a splendid person!” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some\\nwarmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.\\n\\nIt was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor\\nand another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely\\nrelying on Razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing\\nZossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to\\ngo to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest\\nsuspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated\\ncondition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw\\nthat they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten\\nminutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and\\nextreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.\\nHe did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the\\nslightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two\\nladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya\\nRomanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and\\naddressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him\\nextraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the\\ninvalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his\\nobservations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate\\nmaterial surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also\\na moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and\\nmoral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...\\nand so on.” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his\\nwords with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this\\ntheme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as\\nto “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid\\nsmile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient\\nhad some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,\\nwas now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but\\nthat it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in\\ndelirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have\\na favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all\\nfresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly. Then he got up,\\ntook leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm\\ngratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna\\nspontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased\\nwith his visit and still more so with himself.\\n\\n“We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!” Razumihin said in conclusion,\\nfollowing Zossimov out. “I’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as\\npossible with my report.”\\n\\n“That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,” remarked Zossimov,\\nalmost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.\\n\\n“Fetching? You said fetching?” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov\\nand seized him by the throat. “If you ever dare.... Do you understand?\\nDo you understand?” he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing\\nhim against the wall. “Do you hear?”\\n\\n“Let me go, you drunken devil,” said Zossimov, struggling and when he\\nhad let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.\\nRazumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.\\n\\n“Of course, I am an ass,” he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, “but\\nstill... you are another.”\\n\\n“No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly.”\\n\\nThey walked along in silence and only when they were close to\\nRaskolnikov’s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable\\nanxiety.\\n\\n“Listen,” he said, “you’re a first-rate fellow, but among your other\\nfailings, you’re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You\\nare a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you’re getting fat\\nand lazy and can’t deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because\\nit leads one straight into the dirt. You’ve let yourself get so slack\\nthat I don’t know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.\\nYou--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your\\npatients! In another three or four years you won’t get up for your\\npatients... But hang it all, that’s not the point!... You are going\\nto spend to-night in the landlady’s flat here. (Hard work I’ve had to\\npersuade her!) And I’ll be in the kitchen. So here’s a chance for you to\\nget to know her better.... It’s not as you think! There’s not a trace of\\nanything of the sort, brother...!”\\n\\n“But I don’t think!”\\n\\n“Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage\\nvirtue... and yet she’s sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!\\nSave me from her, by all that’s unholy! She’s most prepossessing... I’ll\\nrepay you, I’ll do anything....”\\n\\nZossimov laughed more violently than ever.\\n\\n“Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?”\\n\\n“It won’t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,\\nas long as you sit by her and talk. You’re a doctor, too; try curing\\nher of something. I swear you won’t regret it. She has a piano, and you\\nknow, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: ‘I\\nshed hot tears.’ She likes the genuine article--and well, it all\\nbegan with that song; Now you’re a regular performer, a _maître_, a\\nRubinstein.... I assure you, you won’t regret it!”\\n\\n“But have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise of\\nmarriage, perhaps?”\\n\\n“Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is not\\nthat sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that....”\\n\\n“Well then, drop her!”\\n\\n“But I can’t drop her like that!”\\n\\n“Why can’t you?”\\n\\n“Well, I can’t, that’s all about it! There’s an element of attraction\\nhere, brother.”\\n\\n“Then why have you fascinated her?”\\n\\n“I haven’t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.\\nBut she won’t care a straw whether it’s you or I, so long as somebody\\nsits beside her, sighing.... I can’t explain the position, brother...\\nlook here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin\\nteaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I’m not joking, I’m\\nin earnest, it’ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh\\nfor a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time\\nabout the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she\\njust sighed and perspired! And you mustn’t talk of love--she’s bashful\\nto hysterics--but just let her see you can’t tear yourself away--that’s\\nenough. It’s fearfully comfortable; you’re quite at home, you can\\nread, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if you’re\\ncareful.”\\n\\n“But what do I want with her?”\\n\\n“Ach, I can’t make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!\\nI have often been reminded of you!... You’ll come to it in the end! So\\ndoes it matter whether it’s sooner or later? There’s the feather-bed\\nelement here, brother--ach! and not only that! There’s an attraction\\nhere--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,\\nthe navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the\\nworld, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening\\nsamovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as\\nsnug as though you were dead, and yet you’re alive--the advantages\\nof both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I’m talking, it’s\\nbedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so I’ll go in and look at\\nhim. But there’s no need, it’s all right. Don’t you worry yourself,\\nyet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you notice\\nanything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there can’t be....”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nRazumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, troubled and serious.\\nHe found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.\\nHe had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He\\nremembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly\\nnovel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression\\nunlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised\\nclearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly\\nunattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and\\nhe hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties\\nbequeathed him by that “thrice accursed yesterday.”\\n\\nThe most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown\\nhimself “base and mean,” not only because he had been drunk, but\\nbecause he had taken advantage of the young girl’s position to abuse\\nher _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual\\nrelations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And\\nwhat right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?\\nWho had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as\\nAvdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there\\nmust be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know\\nthe character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how\\ndespicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?\\nSuch a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the\\ntruth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse\\nand envious heart”! And would such a dream ever be permissible to\\nhim, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy\\nbraggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical\\na juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and\\nsuddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had\\nsaid last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of\\nAvdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist\\ndown heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the\\nbricks flying.\\n\\n“Of course,” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of\\nself-abasement, “of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or\\nsmoothed over... and so it’s useless even to think of it, and I must\\ngo to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask\\nforgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!”\\n\\nAnd yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.\\nHe hadn’t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn’t have put it\\non. “I would have made a point of not putting it on.” But in any case he\\ncould not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend\\nthe feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his\\nassistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.\\nHis linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.\\n\\nHe washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he\\nwashed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the\\nquestion whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna\\nhad capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question\\nwas angrily answered in the negative. “Let it stay as it is! What if\\nthey think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think\\nso! Not on any account!”\\n\\n“And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the\\nmanners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had\\nsome of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be\\nproud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all\\nthe same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly\\ndishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to\\nset all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he’d\\nmake a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he\\nwouldn’t care! He’d be worse!”\\n\\nHe was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night\\nin Praskovya Pavlovna’s parlour, came in.\\n\\nHe was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.\\nRazumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.\\nZossimov gave orders that they shouldn’t wake him and promised to see\\nhim again about eleven.\\n\\n“If he is still at home,” he added. “Damn it all! If one can’t control\\none’s patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will\\ngo to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?”\\n\\n“They are coming, I think,” said Razumihin, understanding the object\\nof the question, “and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.\\nI’ll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I.”\\n\\n“But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I’ve plenty\\nto do besides looking after them.”\\n\\n“One thing worries me,” interposed Razumihin, frowning. “On the way home\\nI talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and\\namongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.”\\n\\n“You told the ladies so, too.”\\n\\n“I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so\\nseriously?”\\n\\n“That’s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,\\nyourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to\\nhim... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with\\nyour story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,\\nperhaps, mad on that very point! If only I’d known what happened then\\nat the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this\\nsuspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.\\nThese monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and\\nsee their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was\\nZametov’s story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I\\nknow one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat\\nof a little boy of eight, because he couldn’t endure the jokes he made\\nevery day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police\\nofficer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half\\nfrantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That\\nmay well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it\\nall!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but\\nhm... he shouldn’t have told all that last night. He is an awful\\nchatterbox!”\\n\\n“But whom did he tell it to? You and me?”\\n\\n“And Porfiry.”\\n\\n“What does that matter?”\\n\\n“And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?\\nTell them to be more careful with him to-day....”\\n\\n“They’ll get on all right!” Razumihin answered reluctantly.\\n\\n“Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn’t\\nseem to dislike him... and they haven’t a farthing, I suppose? eh?”\\n\\n“But what business is it of yours?” Razumihin cried with annoyance. “How\\ncan I tell whether they’ve a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps\\nyou’ll find out....”\\n\\n“Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night’s wine has not gone off\\nyet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night’s\\nlodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through\\nthe door; she was up at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her\\nfrom the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....”\\n\\nAt nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev’s\\nhouse. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They\\nhad risen at seven o’clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as\\nnight, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He\\nhad reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at\\nhim, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced\\ntimidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that\\nmoment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such\\ncomplete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and\\nill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater\\nconfusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a\\nsubject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.\\n\\nHearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because\\n“she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over\\nbeforehand.” Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation\\nto have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya\\nRomanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and\\nthey asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such\\na dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin\\nvigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped\\nin embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\\nquestions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.\\n\\nHe talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted\\nby their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the\\nmost important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov’s life,\\nconcluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,\\nhowever, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at\\nthe police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly\\nto his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his\\nlisteners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.\\n\\n“Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don’t know\\nyour name!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.\\n\\n“Dmitri Prokofitch.”\\n\\n“I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he\\nlooks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are\\nhis likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,\\nwhat are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is\\nhe now? In a word, I should like...”\\n\\n“Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?” observed Dounia.\\n\\n“Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,\\nDmitri Prokofitch!”\\n\\n“Naturally,” answered Razumihin. “I have no mother, but my uncle comes\\nevery year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in\\nappearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years’ separation\\nmeans a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for\\na year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of\\nlate--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and\\nfanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like\\nshowing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his\\nheart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply\\ncold and inhumanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between\\ntwo characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is\\nso busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing\\nnothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because he hasn’t the wit, but\\nas though he hadn’t time to waste on such trifles. He never listens\\nto what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other\\npeople at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps\\nhe is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most\\nbeneficial influence upon him.”\\n\\n“God grant it may,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by\\nRazumihin’s account of her Rodya.\\n\\nAnd Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.\\nHe glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and\\nlooked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening\\nattentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her\\narms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,\\nwithout stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to\\nwhat was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a\\nwhite transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of\\nextreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed\\nlike a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps\\njust because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery\\nof her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be\\nafraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very\\ntrying for a man who already felt diffident.\\n\\n“You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s\\ncharacter... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you\\nwere too uncritically devoted to him,” observed Avdotya Romanovna with\\na smile. “I think you are right that he needs a woman’s care,” she added\\nthoughtfully.\\n\\n“I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only...”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“He loves no one and perhaps he never will,” Razumihin declared\\ndecisively.\\n\\n“You mean he is not capable of love?”\\n\\n“Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in\\neverything, indeed!” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but\\nremembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,\\nhe turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya\\nRomanovna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.\\n\\n“You may both be mistaken about Rodya,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,\\nslightly piqued. “I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.\\nWhat Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have\\nsupposed may be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how\\nmoody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what\\nhe would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might\\ndo something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for\\ninstance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave\\nme a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that\\ngirl--what was her name--his landlady’s daughter?”\\n\\n“Did you hear about that affair?” asked Avdotya Romanovna.\\n\\n“Do you suppose----” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. “Do you\\nsuppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from\\ngrief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have\\ndisregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!”\\n\\n“He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,” Razumihin answered\\ncautiously. “But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,\\nthough she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was\\nrather strange.”\\n\\n“And what did you hear?” both the ladies asked at once.\\n\\n“Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which\\nonly failed to take place through the girl’s death, was not at all to\\nPraskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all\\npretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and\\nqueer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have\\nhad some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable.... She had no money\\neither and he wouldn’t have considered her money.... But it’s always\\ndifficult to judge in such matters.”\\n\\n“I am sure she was a good girl,” Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.\\n\\n“God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don’t know\\nwhich of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her\\nor she to him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began\\ntentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with\\nLuzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to\\nthe latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently\\ncaused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in\\ndetail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly\\nblamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not\\nseeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.\\n\\n“He had planned it before his illness,” he added.\\n\\n“I think so, too,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.\\nBut she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself\\nso carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.\\nAvdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.\\n\\n“So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\ncould not resist asking.\\n\\n“I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,”\\n Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply\\nfrom vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna\\nhas of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so\\nrudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...\\nmad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this\\nmorning I am ashamed of it.”\\n\\nHe crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not\\nbreak the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began\\nto speak of Luzhin.\\n\\nWithout her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what\\nto do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she\\nconfessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.\\n\\n“You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,” she began. “I’ll be perfectly open with\\nDmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?”\\n\\n“Of course, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.\\n\\n“This is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to\\nspeak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. “Very early this\\nmorning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter\\nannouncing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you\\nknow; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these\\nlodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would\\nbe here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.\\nYou’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me\\nvery much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid\\nopinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than\\nanyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell\\nyou, made her decision at once, but I still don’t feel sure how to act\\nand I... I’ve been waiting for your opinion.”\\n\\nRazumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read\\nas follows:\\n\\n“Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you\\nthat owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at\\nthe railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object\\nin view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with\\nyou to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of\\ndelay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you\\nare meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have\\nthe honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings\\nnot later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and\\nherewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative\\nrequest that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as\\nhe offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my\\nvisit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire\\nfrom you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation\\nupon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own\\ninterpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,\\nthat if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be\\ncompelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to\\nblame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so\\nill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able\\nto leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief\\nby the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who\\nwas run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of\\nnotorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the\\nfuneral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to\\nraise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable\\ndaughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage\\nof\\n\\n“Your humble servant,\\n\\n“P. LUZHIN.”\\n\\n\\n“What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\\nalmost weeping. “How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted\\nso earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not\\nto receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will\\nhappen then?”\\n\\n“Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin answered calmly at\\nonce.\\n\\n“Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t\\nexplain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that\\nit would be best, but that it’s absolutely necessary that Rodya should\\nmake a point of being here at eight o’clock and that they must meet....\\nI didn’t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him\\nfrom coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so\\nirritable.... Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who died\\nand that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the\\nmoney... which...”\\n\\n“Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,” put in Avdotya Romanovna.\\n\\n“He was not himself yesterday,” Razumihin said thoughtfully, “if you\\nonly knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there\\nwas sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home\\nyesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand\\na word.... But last night, I myself...”\\n\\n“The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and\\nthere I assure you we shall see at once what’s to be done. Besides,\\nit’s getting late--good heavens, it’s past ten,” she cried looking at\\na splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin\\nVenetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her\\ndress. “A present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin.\\n\\n“We must start, Dounia, we must start,” her mother cried in a flutter.\\n“He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming\\nso late. Merciful heavens!”\\n\\nWhile she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;\\nDounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were\\nnot merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty\\ngave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in\\npeople who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently\\nat Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. “The queen who mended her\\nstockings in prison,” he thought, “must have looked then every inch a\\nqueen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.”\\n\\n“My God!” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “little did I think that I\\nshould ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,\\nDmitri Prokofitch,” she added, glancing at him timidly.\\n\\n“Don’t be afraid, mother,” said Dounia, kissing her, “better have faith\\nin him.”\\n\\n“Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven’t slept all night,”\\n exclaimed the poor woman.\\n\\nThey came out into the street.\\n\\n“Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of\\nMarfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took\\nmy hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were\\nblaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don’t know, Dmitri\\nProkofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!”\\n\\n“No, I didn’t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?”\\n\\n“She died suddenly; and only fancy...”\\n\\n“Afterwards, mamma,” put in Dounia. “He doesn’t know who Marfa Petrovna\\nis.”\\n\\n“Ah, you don’t know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.\\nForgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don’t know what I am thinking about\\nthese last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and\\nso I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a\\nrelation.... Don’t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what’s the\\nmatter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?”\\n\\n“Yes, I bruised it,” muttered Razumihin overjoyed.\\n\\n“I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault\\nwith me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether\\nhe is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,\\nyou say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy\\nhim with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to\\ntreat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.”\\n\\n“Don’t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don’t\\nask him too much about his health; he doesn’t like that.”\\n\\n“Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the\\nstairs.... What an awful staircase!”\\n\\n“Mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, darling,” said\\nDounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: “He ought to be\\nhappy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.”\\n\\n“Wait, I’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.”\\n\\nThe ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they\\nreached the landlady’s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her\\ndoor was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching\\nthem from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was\\nsuddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried\\nout.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n“He is well, quite well!” Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.\\n\\nHe had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place\\nas before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,\\nfully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for\\nsome time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed\\nto follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.\\n\\nRaskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the\\nday before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like\\na wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.\\nHis brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke\\nlittle and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a\\nrestlessness in his movements.\\n\\nHe only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete\\nthe impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The\\npale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister\\nentered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\\nplace of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look\\nof suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient\\nwith all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed\\nin him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of\\nbitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable\\ntorture. He saw later that almost every word of the following\\nconversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But\\nat the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself\\nand hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a\\nmonomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\\n\\n“Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,” said Raskolnikov,\\ngiving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna radiant at once. “And I don’t say this _as I did\\nyesterday_,” he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of\\nhis hand.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,” began Zossimov, much\\ndelighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping\\nup a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. “In another three or\\nfour days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,\\nas he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been\\ncoming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been\\nperhaps your own fault?” he added, with a tentative smile, as though\\nstill afraid of irritating him.\\n\\n“It is very possible,” answered Raskolnikov coldly.\\n\\n“I should say, too,” continued Zossimov with zest, “that your complete\\nrecovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,\\nI should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the\\nelementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your\\nmorbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go\\nfrom bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don’t know, but they must\\nbe known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed\\nyourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement\\ncoincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without\\noccupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I\\nfancy, be very beneficial.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to\\nthe university: and then everything will go smoothly....”\\n\\nZossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before\\nthe ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his\\npatient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted\\nan instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking\\nZossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.\\n\\n“What! he saw you last night?” Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.\\n“Then you have not slept either after your journey.”\\n\\n“Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock. Dounia and I never go to\\nbed before two at home.”\\n\\n“I don’t know how to thank him either,” Raskolnikov went on,\\nsuddenly frowning and looking down. “Setting aside the question of\\npayment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I\\nreally don’t know what I have done to deserve such special attention\\nfrom you! I simply don’t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon\\nme, indeed, because I don’t understand it. I tell you so candidly.”\\n\\n“Don’t be irritated.” Zossimov forced himself to laugh. “Assume that you\\nare my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love\\nour first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in\\nlove with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients.”\\n\\n“I say nothing about him,” added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,\\n“though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.”\\n\\n“What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,\\nare you?” shouted Razumihin.\\n\\nIf he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no\\ntrace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.\\nBut Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching\\nher brother.\\n\\n“As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,” he went on, as though\\nrepeating a lesson learned by heart. “It is only to-day that I have\\nbeen able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here\\nyesterday, waiting for me to come back.”\\n\\nWhen he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,\\nsmiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real\\nunfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his\\nhand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her\\nsince their dispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up\\nwith ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken\\nreconciliation. “Yes, that is what I love him for,” Razumihin,\\nexaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his\\nchair. “He has these movements.”\\n\\n“And how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself. “What\\ngenerous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end\\nto all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his\\nhand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what\\nfine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better\\nlooking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly\\nhe’s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch’s shop, is\\nbetter dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but\\nI am afraid.... Oh, dear, he’s so strange! He’s talking kindly, but I’m\\nafraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...”\\n\\n“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to\\nanswer his words to her, “how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now\\nthat it’s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can\\ntell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace\\nyou and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told\\nus at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away\\nfrom the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the\\nstreets. You can’t imagine how we felt! I couldn’t help thinking of the\\ntragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s--you\\ncan’t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever\\nand fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out\\ntill next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of\\nrushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were\\nalone, utterly alone,” she said plaintively and stopped short,\\nsuddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr\\nPetrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes.... Of course it’s very annoying....” Raskolnikov muttered in\\nreply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed\\nat him in perplexity.\\n\\n“What else was it I wanted to say?” He went on trying to recollect. “Oh,\\nyes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don’t think that I didn’t mean\\nto come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.”\\n\\n“What are you saying, Rodya?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,\\nwas surprised.\\n\\n“Is he answering us as a duty?” Dounia wondered. “Is he being reconciled\\nand asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating\\na lesson?”\\n\\n“I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing\\nto my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out\\nthe blood... I’ve only just dressed.”\\n\\n“Blood! What blood?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing--don’t be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about\\nyesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run\\nover... a clerk...”\\n\\n“Delirious? But you remember everything!” Razumihin interrupted.\\n\\n“That’s true,” Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. “I\\nremember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did\\nthat and went there and said that, I can’t clearly explain now.”\\n\\n“A familiar phenomenon,” interposed Zossimov, “actions are sometimes\\nperformed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the\\nactions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it’s\\nlike a dream.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me almost a\\nmadman,” thought Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed\\nDounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.\\n\\n“There is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied. “In that\\nsense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the\\nslight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we\\nmust draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among\\ndozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.”\\n\\nAt the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on\\nhis favourite subject, everyone frowned.\\n\\nRaskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a\\nstrange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.\\n\\n“Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!”\\n Razumihin cried hastily.\\n\\n“What?” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. “Oh... I got spattered with\\nblood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an\\nunpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave\\naway all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She’s\\na widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,\\nstarving... nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps\\nyou’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them. But I had no right to\\ndo it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.\\nTo help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,\\nchiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents_.” He laughed, “That’s right, isn’t\\nit, Dounia?”\\n\\n“No, it’s not,” answered Dounia firmly.\\n\\n“Bah! you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with\\nhatred, and smiling sarcastically. “I ought to have considered that....\\nWell, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a\\nline you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,\\nmaybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that’s nonsense,” he added\\nirritably, vexed at being carried away. “I only meant to say that I beg\\nyour forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly.\\n\\n“That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,”\\n said his mother, delighted.\\n\\n“Don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.\\n\\nA silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this\\nconversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the\\nforgiveness, and all were feeling it.\\n\\n“It is as though they were afraid of me,” Raskolnikov was thinking\\nto himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.\\n\\n“Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,” flashed through\\nhis mind.\\n\\n“Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\nsuddenly blurted out.\\n\\n“What Marfa Petrovna?”\\n\\n“Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much about\\nher.”\\n\\n“A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she’s dead! Oh, really?” he roused\\nhimself suddenly, as if waking up. “What did she die of?”\\n\\n“Only imagine, quite suddenly,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered\\nhurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. “On the very day I was sending\\nyou that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been\\nthe cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.”\\n\\n“Why, were they on such bad terms?” he asked, addressing his sister.\\n\\n“Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very\\npatient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their\\nmarried life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All\\nof a sudden he seems to have lost patience.”\\n\\n“Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven\\nyears? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?”\\n\\n“No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!” Dounia\\nanswered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into\\nthought.\\n\\n“That had happened in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on\\nhurriedly. “And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be\\nharnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used\\nto drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am\\ntold....”\\n\\n“After the beating?”\\n\\n“That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not\\nto be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was\\nundergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and\\nshe used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got\\ninto the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”\\n\\n“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\\n\\n“And did he beat her badly?”\\n\\n“What does that matter!” put in Dounia.\\n\\n“H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,”\\n said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.\\n\\n“Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,” broke from Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna.\\n\\n“Why, are you all afraid of me?” he asked, with a constrained smile.\\n\\n“That’s certainly true,” said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at\\nher brother. “Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the\\nstairs.”\\n\\nHis face worked, as though in convulsion.\\n\\n“Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, Rodya....\\nWhy did you say that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,\\noverwhelmed--“You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the\\ntrain, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything\\ntogether.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what\\nam I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy\\nnow--simply in seeing you, Rodya....”\\n\\n“Hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but\\npressing her hand. “We shall have time to speak freely of everything!”\\n\\nAs he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned\\npale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly\\nchill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to\\nhim that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be\\nable to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to\\n_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that\\nfor a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not\\nlooking at anyone walked towards the door.\\n\\n“What are you about?” cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.\\n\\nHe sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were\\nall looking at him in perplexity.\\n\\n“But what are you all so dull for?” he shouted, suddenly and quite\\nunexpectedly. “Do say something! What’s the use of sitting like this?\\nCome, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....\\nCome, anything!”\\n\\n“Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning\\nagain,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.\\n\\n“What is the matter, Rodya?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing! I remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly\\nlaughed.\\n\\n“Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!... I was beginning\\nto think...” muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. “It is time\\nfor me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can...” He made\\nhis bows, and went out.\\n\\n“What an excellent man!” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” Raskolnikov\\nbegan, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he\\nhad not shown till then. “I can’t remember where I met him before my\\nillness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good\\nman, too,” he nodded at Razumihin. “Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked\\nher; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.\\n\\n“Very much,” answered Dounia.\\n\\n“Foo!--what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible\\nconfusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled\\nfaintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.\\n\\n“Where are you off to?”\\n\\n“I must go.”\\n\\n“You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don’t go.\\nWhat’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What a pretty watch you have got,\\nDounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.”\\n\\n“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia.\\n\\n“And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.”\\n\\n“I like that sort,” said Dounia.\\n\\n“So it is not a present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin, and was\\nunreasonably delighted.\\n\\n“I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”\\n\\n“A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get\\nmarried?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted\\nby the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, my dear.”\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.\\n\\n“H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much indeed. She was\\nsuch a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.\\n“Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was\\nalways dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she\\nbegan talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very\\nwell. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know what drew me\\nto her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been\\nlame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he\\nsmiled dreamily. “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”\\n\\n“No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling.\\n\\nHe fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did\\nnot understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,\\nwent up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.\\n\\n“You love her even now?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.\\n\\n“Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that’s all now, as\\nit were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything\\nhappening here seems somehow far away.” He looked attentively at them.\\n“You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...\\nbut, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use of\\nasking about it?” he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell\\ninto dreamy silence again.\\n\\n“What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a tomb,” said\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. “I\\nam sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so\\nmelancholy.”\\n\\n“My lodging,” he answered, listlessly. “Yes, the lodging had a great\\ndeal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,\\nwhat a strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing\\nstrangely.\\n\\nA little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,\\nwith him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,\\nin face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,\\nwould have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent\\nmatter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had\\ndecided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of\\nescape.\\n\\n“Listen, Dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course I beg your\\npardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that\\nI do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a\\nscoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease\\nat once to look on you as a sister.”\\n\\n“Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna cried, mournfully. “And why do you call yourself a\\nscoundrel? I can’t bear it. You said the same yesterday.”\\n\\n“Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. “In all\\nthis there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,\\nand found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am\\nsacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at\\nall. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for\\nme. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to\\nmy family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision....”\\n\\n“She is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.\\n“Proud creature! She won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too\\nhaughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,\\nhow I... hate them all!”\\n\\n“In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of\\ntwo evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of\\nme, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?” She, too,\\nflushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.\\n\\n“All?” he asked, with a malignant grin.\\n\\n“Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch’s\\ncourtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too\\nwell of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing\\nagain?”\\n\\n“And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are\\nintentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your\\nown against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked\\nwith him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you\\nare acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.”\\n\\n“It is not true. I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure.\\n“I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me\\nand thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly\\nconvinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing\\nproof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as\\nyou say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a\\nvile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?\\nWhy do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It\\nis despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I\\nam not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you\\nso pale? Rodya, darling, what’s the matter?”\\n\\n“Good heavens! You have made him faint,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“No, no, nonsense! It’s nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You\\nhave fainting on the brain. H’m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In\\nwhat way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,\\nand that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?”\\n\\n“Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia.\\n\\nWith trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He\\ntook it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked\\nwith a sort of wonder at Dounia.\\n\\n“It is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. “What\\nam I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!”\\n\\nHe said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for\\nsome time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at\\nlast, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,\\nslowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected\\nsomething particular.\\n\\n“What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter\\nto his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a\\nbusiness man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and\\nyet he writes such an uneducated letter.”\\n\\nThey all started. They had expected something quite different.\\n\\n“But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin observed, abruptly.\\n\\n“Have you read it?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now,” Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna began, embarrassed.\\n\\n“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in. “Legal\\ndocuments are written like that to this day.”\\n\\n“Legal? Yes, it’s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,\\nand not quite educated--business language!”\\n\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap\\neducation, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya\\nRomanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.\\n\\n“Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You seem to\\nbe offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the\\nletter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to\\nannoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style\\noccurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There\\nis one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and\\nplainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I\\nam present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon\\nyou both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning\\nyou to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an\\nexpression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had\\nwritten it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”\\n\\n“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it\\nwas too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill\\nin writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,\\nindeed...”\\n\\n“It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he\\nintended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression\\nin the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I\\ngave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed\\nwith trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay\\nfor the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,\\nof notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my\\nlife)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander\\nme and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal\\njargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and\\nwith a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act\\nsensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I\\ndon’t think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to\\nwarn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...”\\n\\nDounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only\\nawaiting the evening.\\n\\n“Then what is your decision, Rodya?” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who\\nwas more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his\\ntalk.\\n\\n“What decision?”\\n\\n“You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this\\nevening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?”\\n\\n“That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are\\nnot offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is\\nnot offended. I will do what you think best,” he added, drily.\\n\\n“Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,” Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna hastened to declare.\\n\\n“I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at\\nthis interview,” said Dounia. “Will you come?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,” she said,\\naddressing Razumihin. “Mother, I am inviting him, too.”\\n\\n“Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,” added Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna, “so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like\\nconcealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr\\nPetrovitch may be angry or not, now!”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nAt that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into\\nthe room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with\\nsurprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise\\nher. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for\\nthe first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such\\na dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she\\nwas a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,\\nalmost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but\\nsomewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor\\ndress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a\\nparasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so\\nmuch embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a\\nlittle child. She was even about to retreat. “Oh... it’s you!” said\\nRaskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once\\nrecollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin’s letter\\nof “some young woman of notorious behaviour.” He had only just been\\nprotesting against Luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the\\ngirl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He\\nremembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression “of\\nnotorious behaviour.” All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through\\nhis brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated\\ncreature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she\\nmade a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.\\n\\n“I did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her\\nstop. “Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.\\nAllow me--not there. Sit here....”\\n\\nAt Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of\\nRaskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to\\nenter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where\\nZossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him\\nas a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to\\nRazumihin’s chair.\\n\\n“You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.\\n\\nSonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the\\ntwo ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she\\ncould sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened\\nthat she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed\\nRaskolnikov.\\n\\n“I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you,” she\\nbegan falteringly. “I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to\\nsend. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in\\nthe morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...\\nto do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and\\nceased speaking.\\n\\n“I will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered Raskolnikov. He,\\ntoo, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.\\n“Please sit down,” he said, suddenly. “I want to talk to you. You are\\nperhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and\\nhe drew up a chair for her.\\n\\nSonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened\\nlook at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov’s pale face\\nflushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.\\n\\n“Mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is Sofya Semyonovna\\nMarmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run\\nover yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.”\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up\\nher eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya’s urgent and\\nchallenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia\\ngazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised\\nher with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise\\nher eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.\\n\\n“I wanted to ask you,” said Raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were\\narranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?”\\n\\n“No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...\\nthey did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“At the body’s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,\\nto-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until\\nto-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees\\nherself that it’s necessary...”\\n\\n“To-day, then?”\\n\\n“She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the\\nservice, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.”\\n\\n“She is giving a funeral lunch?”\\n\\n“Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping\\nus yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.”\\n\\nAll at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she\\ncontrolled herself, looking down again.\\n\\nDuring the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a\\nthin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a\\nsharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but\\nher blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such\\na kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help\\nbeing attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another\\npeculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked\\nalmost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this\\nchildishness seemed almost absurd.\\n\\n“But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?\\nDoes she even mean to have a funeral lunch?” Raskolnikov asked,\\npersistently keeping up the conversation.\\n\\n“The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so\\nit won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so\\nthat there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious\\nit should be so. You know one can’t... it’s a comfort to her... she is\\nlike that, you know....”\\n\\n“I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room\\nlike that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb.”\\n\\n“You gave us everything yesterday,” Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a\\nloud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips\\nand chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once\\nby Raskolnikov’s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out\\nspontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,\\nand even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.\\n\\n“Rodya,” she said, getting up, “we shall have dinner together, of\\ncourse. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little\\nwalk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am\\nafraid we have exhausted you....”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I’ll come,” he answered, getting up fussily. “But I have\\nsomething to see to.”\\n\\n“But surely you will have dinner together?” cried Razumihin, looking in\\nsurprise at Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.\\nYou do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him\\nfrom you?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining\\nwith us?”\\n\\n“Please do,” added Dounia.\\n\\nRazumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all\\nstrangely embarrassed.\\n\\n“Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.\\nGood-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again.”\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed\\nto come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.\\n\\nBut Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother\\nout, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave\\na hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort\\nin her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention were\\noppressive and painful to her.\\n\\n“Dounia, good-bye,” called Raskolnikov, in the passage. “Give me your\\nhand.”\\n\\n“Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?” said Dounia, turning\\nwarmly and awkwardly to him.\\n\\n“Never mind, give it to me again.” And he squeezed her fingers warmly.\\n\\nDounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.\\n\\n“Come, that’s capital,” he said to Sonia, going back and looking\\nbrightly at her. “God give peace to the dead, the living have still to\\nlive. That is right, isn’t it?”\\n\\nSonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked\\nat her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father\\nfloated before his memory in those moments....\\n\\n*****\\n\\n“Heavens, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in\\nthe street, “I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.\\nHow little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad\\nof that.”\\n\\n“I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see it?\\nPerhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much\\ncan be forgiven.”\\n\\n“Well, you were not very patient!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,\\nhotly and jealously. “Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You\\nare the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You\\nare both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both\\ngenerous.... Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of\\nwhat is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!”\\n\\n“Don’t be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be.”\\n\\n“Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch\\nbreaks it off?” poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.\\n\\n“He won’t be worth much if he does,” answered Dounia, sharply and\\ncontemptuously.\\n\\n“We did well to come away,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.\\n“He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has\\na breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is\\none to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up\\nrooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will\\ncrush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I\\ndeclare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman,\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“What young woman, mother?\\n\\n“Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, but\\nas soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief\\ncause of the trouble....”\\n\\n“Nothing of the sort!” cried Dounia, in vexation. “What nonsense, with\\nyour presentiments, mother! He only made her acquaintance the evening\\nbefore, and he did not know her when she came in.”\\n\\n“Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will\\nsee! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I could\\nscarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you\\nremember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that\\nabout her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great\\ndeal of her.”\\n\\n“People will write anything. We were talked about and written about,\\ntoo. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it\\nis all nonsense.”\\n\\n“God grant it may be!”\\n\\n“And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,” Dounia snapped out,\\nsuddenly.\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n“I will tell you what I want with you,” said Raskolnikov, drawing\\nRazumihin to the window.\\n\\n“Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming,” Sonia said\\nhurriedly, preparing to depart.\\n\\n“One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in our\\nway. I want to have another word or two with you. Listen!” he turned\\nsuddenly to Razumihin again. “You know that... what’s his name...\\nPorfiry Petrovitch?”\\n\\n“I should think so! He is a relation. Why?” added the latter, with\\ninterest.\\n\\n“Is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?... You\\nwere speaking about it yesterday.”\\n\\n“Yes... well?” Razumihin’s eyes opened wide.\\n\\n“He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some\\npledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when\\nI left home, and my father’s silver watch--they are only worth five or\\nsix roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I\\ndo not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just\\nnow, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia’s\\nwatch. It is the only thing of father’s left us. She would be ill if\\nit were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I\\nought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be\\nbetter to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter\\nmight be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before\\ndinner.”\\n\\n“Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry,” Razumihin\\nshouted in extraordinary excitement. “Well, how glad I am. Let us go at\\nonce. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him.”\\n\\n“Very well, let us go.”\\n\\n“And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance. I have\\noften talked to him of you at different times. I was speaking of you\\nyesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman? So that’s it! It is all\\nturning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna...”\\n\\n“Sofya Semyonovna,” corrected Raskolnikov. “Sofya Semyonovna, this is my\\nfriend Razumihin, and he is a good man.”\\n\\n“If you have to go now,” Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin\\nat all, and still more embarrassed.\\n\\n“Let us go,” decided Raskolnikov. “I will come to you to-day, Sofya\\nSemyonovna. Only tell me where you live.”\\n\\nHe was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her\\neyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so. They all went\\nout together.\\n\\n“Don’t you lock up?” asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs.\\n\\n“Never,” answered Raskolnikov. “I have been meaning to buy a lock for\\nthese two years. People are happy who have no need of locks,” he said,\\nlaughing, to Sonia. They stood still in the gateway.\\n\\n“Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me, by the\\nway?” he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. He\\nwanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.\\n\\n“Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.”\\n\\n“Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is your sister?\\nDid I give her the address?”\\n\\n“Why, had you forgotten?”\\n\\n“No, I remember.”\\n\\n“I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name,\\nand he did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name,\\nI asked to-day, ‘Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?’ I did not know you\\nhad only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna.”\\n\\nShe was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,\\nhurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty\\nsteps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then\\nmoving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to\\nremember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she\\nfelt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was\\nopening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to\\ncome to her that day, perhaps at once!\\n\\n“Only not to-day, please, not to-day!” she kept muttering with a sinking\\nheart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child. “Mercy! to\\nme... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!”\\n\\nShe was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who\\nwas watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from\\nthe gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood\\nstill at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,\\nstarted on hearing Sonia’s words: “and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov\\nlived?” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially\\nupon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted\\nthe house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not\\nto betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for\\nsomething. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and\\nthat Sonia was going home.\\n\\n“Home? Where? I’ve seen that face somewhere,” he thought. “I must find\\nout.”\\n\\nAt the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the\\nsame way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on\\nthe other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook\\nher and kept two or three yards behind her.\\n\\nHe was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high\\nshoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore\\ngood and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.\\nHe carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each\\nstep; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face\\nwith high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.\\nHis flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with\\ngrey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.\\nHis eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were\\ncrimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger\\nthan his years.\\n\\nWhen Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on\\nthe pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching\\nthe house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed\\nher, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right\\ncorner. “Bah!” muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs\\nbehind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,\\nturned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed\\nin chalk, “Kapernaumov, Tailor.” “Bah!” the stranger repeated again,\\nwondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.\\nThe doors were two or three yards apart.\\n\\n“You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.\\n“He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at\\nMadame Resslich’s. How odd!” Sonia looked at him attentively.\\n\\n“We are neighbours,” he went on gaily. “I only came to town the day\\nbefore yesterday. Good-bye for the present.”\\n\\nSonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for\\nsome reason ashamed and uneasy.\\n\\n*****\\n\\nOn the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was obviously excited.\\n\\n“That’s capital, brother,” he repeated several times, “and I am glad! I\\nam glad!”\\n\\n“What are you glad about?” Raskolnikov thought to himself.\\n\\n“I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, too. And...\\nwas it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?”\\n\\n“What a simple-hearted fool he is!”\\n\\n“When was it?” Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. “Two or three\\ndays before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem\\nthe things now,” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous\\nsolicitude about the things. “I’ve not more than a silver rouble\\nleft... after last night’s accursed delirium!”\\n\\nHe laid special emphasis on the delirium.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. “Then\\nthat’s why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you\\nwere continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that’s\\nclear, it’s all clear now.”\\n\\n“Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will\\ngo to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared\\nup_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have\\non all of them!”\\n\\n“Shall we find him?” he asked suddenly.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” Razumihin answered quickly. “He is a nice fellow, you will\\nsee, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished\\nmanners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent\\nfellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He\\nis incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or\\nrather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....\\nBut he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a\\ncase of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very\\nanxious to make your acquaintance!”\\n\\n“On what grounds is he so anxious?”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s not exactly... you see, since you’ve been ill I happen to have\\nmentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about\\nyour being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,\\n‘What a pity!’ And so I concluded... from everything together, not only\\nthat; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on\\nthe way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,\\nof your exaggerating it, you see.”\\n\\n“What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right,” he said\\nwith a constrained smile.\\n\\n“Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was\\nsomething else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.”\\n\\n“But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!” Raskolnikov cried\\nwith exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.\\n\\n“I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One’s ashamed\\nto speak of it.”\\n\\n“If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.”\\n\\nBoth were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov\\nperceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had\\njust said about Porfiry.\\n\\n“I shall have to pull a long face with him too,” he thought, with a\\nbeating heart, and he turned white, “and do it naturally, too. But the\\nmost natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing\\nat all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we\\nshall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good\\nthing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is\\nbeating, that’s what’s bad!”\\n\\n“In this grey house,” said Razumihin.\\n\\n“The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old\\nhag’s flat yesterday... and asked about the blood? I must find that out\\ninstantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise... I’ll\\nfind out, if it’s my ruin.”\\n\\n“I say, brother,” he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly\\nsmile, “I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously\\nexcited. Isn’t it so?”\\n\\n“Excited? Not a bit of it,” said Razumihin, stung to the quick.\\n\\n“Yes, brother, I assure you it’s noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair\\nin a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be\\nwrithing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you\\nwere angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even\\nblushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed\\nawfully.”\\n\\n“Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?”\\n\\n“But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By Jove, there\\nhe’s blushing again.”\\n\\n“What a pig you are!”\\n\\n“But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, I’ll tell of you\\nto-day. Ha-ha-ha! I’ll make mother laugh, and someone else, too...”\\n\\n“Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you fiend!”\\n Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. “What will\\nyou tell them? Come, brother... foo! what a pig you are!”\\n\\n“You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; a\\nRomeo over six foot high! And how you’ve washed to-day--you cleaned your\\nnails, I declare. Eh? That’s something unheard of! Why, I do believe\\nyou’ve got pomatum on your hair! Bend down.”\\n\\n“Pig!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. So\\nlaughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch’s flat. This is what\\nRaskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they\\ncame in, still guffawing in the passage.\\n\\n“Not a word here or I’ll... brain you!” Razumihin whispered furiously,\\nseizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nRaskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as though\\nhe had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him\\nRazumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,\\nwith an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and\\nwhole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified\\nRaskolnikov’s laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,\\nbowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room\\nlooking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still\\napparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few\\nwords to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming\\na serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as\\nthough accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:\\nhis stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried\\nto restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received\\nthis “spontaneous” mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most\\ngenuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as\\nthough on purpose.\\n\\n“Fool! You fiend,” he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a\\nlittle round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent\\nflying and crashing.\\n\\n“But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it’s a loss to the Crown,”\\n Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.\\n\\nRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch’s,\\nbut anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural\\nend to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table\\nand smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and\\nturned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back\\nto the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.\\nPorfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but\\nobviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the\\ncorner, but he rose at the visitors’ entrance and was standing in\\nexpectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and\\neven it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a\\ncertain embarrassment. Zametov’s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov\\nunpleasantly.\\n\\n“I’ve got to think of that,” he thought. “Excuse me, please,” he began,\\naffecting extreme embarrassment. “Raskolnikov.”\\n\\n“Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you’ve come\\nin.... Why, won’t he even say good-morning?” Porfiry Petrovitch nodded\\nat Razumihin.\\n\\n“Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage with me. I only\\ntold him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. And\\nthat was all, I think!”\\n\\n“Pig!” ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.\\n\\n“There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at\\nthe word,” Porfiry laughed.\\n\\n“Oh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!” snapped Razumihin, and suddenly\\nbursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more\\ncheerful face as though nothing had happened. “That’ll do! We are\\nall fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch\\nRaskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make\\nyour acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with\\nyou. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you\\nknown each other long?”\\n\\n“What does this mean?” thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\\n\\nZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\\n\\n“Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,” he said easily.\\n\\n“Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me\\nto introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out\\nwithout me. Where is your tobacco?”\\n\\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and\\ntrodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,\\nstout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short\\nand had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His\\nsoft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,\\nbut had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been\\ngood-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,\\nmawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression\\nof those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish\\nfigure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at\\nfirst sight.\\n\\nAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter\\nof business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down\\nhimself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with\\nthat careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and\\nembarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are\\ndiscussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such\\nexceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov\\nexplained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied\\nwith himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.\\nPorfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,\\nsitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,\\nlooking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive\\ninterest.\\n\\n“Fool,” Raskolnikov swore to himself.\\n\\n“You have to give information to the police,” Porfiry replied, with a\\nmost businesslike air, “that having learnt of this incident, that is of\\nthe murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such\\nand such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...\\nor... but they will write to you.”\\n\\n“That’s just the point, that at the present moment,” Raskolnikov tried\\nhis utmost to feign embarrassment, “I am not quite in funds... and\\neven this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for\\nthe present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have\\nmoney....”\\n\\n“That’s no matter,” answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his\\nexplanation of his pecuniary position coldly, “but you can, if you\\nprefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the\\nmatter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...”\\n\\n“On an ordinary sheet of paper?” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again\\ninterested in the financial side of the question.\\n\\n“Oh, the most ordinary,” and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with\\nobvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at\\nhim. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s fancy, for it all lasted but a\\nmoment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could\\nhave sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.\\n\\n“He knows,” flashed through his mind like lightning.\\n\\n“Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,” he went on, a little\\ndisconcerted, “the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them\\nparticularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must\\nconfess that I was alarmed when I heard...”\\n\\n“That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that\\nPorfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!” Razumihin put in\\nwith obvious intention.\\n\\nThis was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him\\nwith a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately\\nrecollected himself.\\n\\n“You seem to be jeering at me, brother?” he said to him, with a\\nwell-feigned irritability. “I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious\\nabout such trash; but you mustn’t think me selfish or grasping for that,\\nand these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you\\njust now that the silver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the\\nonly thing left us of my father’s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is\\nhere,” he turned suddenly to Porfiry, “and if she knew,” he turned again\\nhurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, “that the\\nwatch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!”\\n\\n“Not a bit of it! I didn’t mean that at all! Quite the contrary!”\\n shouted Razumihin distressed.\\n\\n“Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?” Raskolnikov asked\\nhimself in a tremor. “Why did I say that about women?”\\n\\n“Oh, your mother is with you?” Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“When did she come?”\\n\\n“Last night.”\\n\\nPorfiry paused as though reflecting.\\n\\n“Your things would not in any case be lost,” he went on calmly and\\ncoldly. “I have been expecting you here for some time.”\\n\\nAnd as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered\\nthe ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash\\nover the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be\\nlooking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette.\\n\\n“What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?”\\n cried Razumihin.\\n\\nPorfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on\\nthe paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the\\ndate on which you left them with her...”\\n\\n“How observant you are!” Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very\\nutmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly\\nadded:\\n\\n“I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it\\nmust be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so\\nclearly, and... and...”\\n\\n“Stupid! Feeble!” he thought. “Why did I add that?”\\n\\n“But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn’t\\ncome forward,” Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.\\n\\n“I haven’t been quite well.”\\n\\n“I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress\\nabout something. You look pale still.”\\n\\n“I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well,” Raskolnikov snapped\\nout rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was\\nmounting, he could not repress it. “And in my anger I shall betray\\nmyself,” flashed through his mind again. “Why are they torturing me?”\\n\\n“Not quite well!” Razumihin caught him up. “What next! He was\\nunconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as\\nsoon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,\\nand gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,\\ndelirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!”\\n\\n“Really delirious? You don’t say so!” Porfiry shook his head in a\\nwomanish way.\\n\\n“Nonsense! Don’t you believe it! But you don’t believe it anyway,”\\n Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem\\nto catch those strange words.\\n\\n“But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been delirious?”\\n Razumihin got hot suddenly. “What did you go out for? What was the\\nobject of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did\\nit? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.”\\n\\n“I was awfully sick of them yesterday.” Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry\\nsuddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, “I ran away from them to\\ntake lodgings where they wouldn’t find me, and took a lot of money with\\nme. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or\\ndelirious yesterday; settle our dispute.”\\n\\nHe could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his\\nexpression and his silence to him.\\n\\n“In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were\\nextremely irritable,” Zametov pronounced dryly.\\n\\n“And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,” put in Porfiry Petrovitch,\\n“that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had\\nbeen run over.”\\n\\n“And there,” said Razumihin, “weren’t you mad then? You gave your last\\npenny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen\\nor twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he\\nflung away all the twenty-five at once!”\\n\\n“Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So\\nthat’s why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I’ve found a\\ntreasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour\\nwith such trivialities,” he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with\\ntrembling lips. “We are boring you, aren’t we?”\\n\\n“Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you\\ninterest me! It’s interesting to look on and listen... and I am really\\nglad you have come forward at last.”\\n\\n“But you might give us some tea! My throat’s dry,” cried Razumihin.\\n\\n“Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn’t you\\nlike... something more essential before tea?”\\n\\n“Get along with you!”\\n\\nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\\n\\nRaskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.\\n\\n“The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care to stand on\\nceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at all, did you come to talk\\nto Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don’t care to hide that they are\\ntracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.” He was\\nshaking with rage. “Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me like a\\ncat with a mouse. It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I\\nwon’t allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly\\nfaces, and you’ll see how I despise you.” He could hardly breathe.\\n“And what if it’s only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through\\ninexperience I get angry and don’t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it’s\\nall unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is\\nsomething about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.\\nWhy did he say bluntly, ‘With her’? Why did Zametov add that I spoke\\nartfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin\\nis sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never\\ndoes see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of\\ncourse it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset\\nmy nerves or are they teasing me? Either it’s ill fancy or they know!\\nEven Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.\\nI foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it’s my\\nfirst visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back\\nto him. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they\\nwere talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If\\nonly they’d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he\\nlet it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use\\nafterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last\\nnight! He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival! The hag had written the\\ndate on in pencil! You are wrong, you won’t catch me! There are no\\nfacts... it’s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn’t a\\nfact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the\\nflat? I won’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being\\nangry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that’s\\nright; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch\\nme. Why did I come?”\\n\\nAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.\\n\\nPorfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.\\n\\n“Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out\\nof sorts altogether,” he began in quite a different tone, laughing to\\nRazumihin.\\n\\n“Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.\\nWho got the best of it?”\\n\\n“Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated\\noff into space.”\\n\\n“Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a\\nthing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off.”\\n\\n“What is there strange? It’s an everyday social question,” Raskolnikov\\nanswered casually.\\n\\n“The question wasn’t put quite like that,” observed Porfiry.\\n\\n“Not quite, that’s true,” Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and\\nhurried as usual. “Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to\\nhear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to\\nhelp me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist\\ndoctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the\\nabnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing\\nmore; no other causes admitted!...”\\n\\n“You are wrong there,” cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably\\nanimated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him\\nmore excited than ever.\\n\\n“Nothing is admitted,” Razumihin interrupted with heat.\\n\\n“I am not wrong. I’ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them\\nis ‘the influence of environment,’ and nothing else. Their favourite\\nphrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,\\nall crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest\\nagainst and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature\\nis not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to exist!\\nThey don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living\\nprocess, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a\\nsocial system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going\\nto organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an\\ninstant, quicker than any living process! That’s why they instinctively\\ndislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they\\nexplain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the _living_\\nprocess of life; they don’t want a _living soul_! The living soul\\ndemands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an\\nobject of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though\\nit smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not\\nalive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt! And it comes in the end\\nto their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning\\nof rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,\\nindeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it\\nwants life, it hasn’t completed its vital process, it’s too soon for the\\ngraveyard! You can’t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three\\npossibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce\\nit all to the question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution of the\\nproblem! It’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about it. That’s\\nthe great thing, you mustn’t think! The whole secret of life in two\\npages of print!”\\n\\n“Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!” laughed\\nPorfiry. “Can you imagine,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “six people\\nholding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a\\npreliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a\\ngreat deal in crime; I can assure you of that.”\\n\\n“Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child\\nof ten; was it environment drove him to it?”\\n\\n“Well, strictly speaking, it did,” Porfiry observed with noteworthy\\ngravity; “a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the\\ninfluence of environment.”\\n\\nRazumihin was almost in a frenzy. “Oh, if you like,” he roared. “I’ll\\nprove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the\\nChurch of Ivan the Great’s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I\\nwill prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal\\ntendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?”\\n\\n“Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!”\\n\\n“He is always humbugging, confound him,” cried Razumihin, jumping up and\\ngesticulating. “What’s the use of talking to you? He does all that\\non purpose; you don’t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday,\\nsimply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they\\nwere delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he\\npersuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two\\nmonths. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going\\nto get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered\\nnew clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no\\nbride, nothing, all pure fantasy!”\\n\\n“Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in\\nfact that made me think of taking you in.”\\n\\n“Are you such a good dissembler?” Raskolnikov asked carelessly.\\n\\n“You wouldn’t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in,\\ntoo. Ha-ha-ha! No, I’ll tell you the truth. All these questions about\\ncrime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours\\nwhich interested me at the time. ‘On Crime’... or something of the\\nsort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the\\n_Periodical Review_.”\\n\\n“My article? In the _Periodical Review_?” Raskolnikov asked in\\nastonishment. “I certainly did write an article upon a book six months\\nago when I left the university, but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_.”\\n\\n“But it came out in the _Periodical_.”\\n\\n“And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist, so that’s why it wasn’t\\nprinted at the time.”\\n\\n“That’s true; but when it ceased to exist, the _Weekly Review_ was\\namalgamated with the _Periodical_, and so your article appeared two\\nmonths ago in the latter. Didn’t you know?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov had not known.\\n\\n“Why, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a\\nstrange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know\\nnothing of matters that concern you directly. It’s a fact, I assure\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!” cried Razumihin. “I’ll\\nrun to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago?\\nWhat was the date? It doesn’t matter though, I will find it. Think of\\nnot telling us!”\\n\\n“How did you find out that the article was mine? It’s only signed with\\nan initial.”\\n\\n“I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know\\nhim.... I was very much interested.”\\n\\n“I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and\\nafter the crime.”\\n\\n“Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always\\naccompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that part\\nof your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of\\nthe article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working\\nit out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are\\ncertain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have\\na perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the\\nlaw is not for them.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his\\nidea.\\n\\n“What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the\\ninfluence of environment?” Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.\\n\\n“No, not exactly because of it,” answered Porfiry. “In his article all\\nmen are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have\\nto live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,\\ndon’t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to\\ncommit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they\\nare extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?”\\n\\n“What do you mean? That can’t be right?” Razumihin muttered in\\nbewilderment.\\n\\nRaskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they\\nwanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.\\n\\n“That wasn’t quite my contention,” he began simply and modestly. “Yet\\nI admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,\\nperfectly so.” (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) “The only\\ndifference is that I don’t contend that extraordinary people are always\\nbound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt\\nwhether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an\\n‘extraordinary’ man has the right... that is not an official right, but\\nan inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain\\nobstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment\\nof his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).\\nYou say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it as clear\\nas I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I\\nmaintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have\\nbeen made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a\\nhundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have\\nbeen in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for\\nthe sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But\\nit does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people\\nright and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I\\nmaintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,\\nsuch as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without\\nexception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they\\ntransgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held\\nsacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,\\nif that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence\\nof ancient law--were of use to their cause. It’s remarkable, in fact,\\nthat the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity\\nwere guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men\\nor even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving\\nsome new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,\\nof course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut;\\nand to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their\\nvery nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to\\nit. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The\\nsame thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my\\ndivision of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that\\nit’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t insist upon exact numbers. I only\\nbelieve in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law\\nof nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,\\nmaterial that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have\\nthe gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,\\ninnumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both\\ncategories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally\\nspeaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live\\nunder control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty\\nto be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing\\nhumiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the\\nlaw; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their\\ncapacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;\\nfor the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the\\npresent for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the\\nsake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I\\nmaintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading\\nthrough blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.\\nIt’s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article\\n(you remember it began with the legal question). There’s no need for\\nsuch anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,\\nthey punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil\\nquite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these\\ncriminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or\\nless). The first category is always the man of the present, the second\\nthe man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the\\nsecond move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal\\nright to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la\\nguerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!”\\n\\n“Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?”\\n\\n“I do,” Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during\\nthe whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.\\n\\n“And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.”\\n\\n“I do,” repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.\\n\\n“And... do you believe in Lazarus’ rising from the dead?”\\n\\n“I... I do. Why do you ask all this?”\\n\\n“You believe it literally?”\\n\\n“Literally.”\\n\\n“You don’t say so.... I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us\\ngo back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the\\ncontrary...”\\n\\n“Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this\\nlife, and then...”\\n\\n“They begin executing other people?”\\n\\n“If it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is\\nvery witty.”\\n\\n“Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary\\npeople from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel\\nthere ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the\\nnatural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they\\nadopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear something, be\\nbranded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of\\none category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate\\nobstacles’ as you so happily expressed it, then...”\\n\\n“Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other.”\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\n“No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in\\nthe first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps\\nunfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to\\nobedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes\\nvouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,\\n‘destroyers,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and\\nthis quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often\\nunobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling\\ntendencies. But I don’t think there is any considerable danger here,\\nand you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,\\nthey might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away\\nwith them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even\\nthis isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very\\nconscientious: some perform this service for one another and others\\nchastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various\\npublic acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying\\neffect; in fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about.... It’s a law of\\nnature.”\\n\\n“Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but\\nthere’s another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people\\nwho have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am\\nready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming\\nif there are a great many of them, eh?”\\n\\n“Oh, you needn’t worry about that either,” Raskolnikov went on in the\\nsame tone. “People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for\\nsaying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily\\nso in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these\\ngrades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity\\nsome law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am\\nconvinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of\\nmankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,\\nby some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and\\nstocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a\\nthousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I\\nspeak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with\\nstill greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius\\nis one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,\\nappear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have\\nnot peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there\\ncertainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of\\nchance.”\\n\\n“Why, are you both joking?” Razumihin cried at last. “There you sit,\\nmaking fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.\\nAnd the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of\\nPorfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.\\n\\n“Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,\\nin saying that it’s not new, that it’s like what we’ve read and heard a\\nthousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is\\nexclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed\\n_in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such\\nfanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that\\nsanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible\\nthan the official, legal sanction of bloodshed....”\\n\\n“You are quite right, it is more terrible,” Porfiry agreed.\\n\\n“Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it.\\nYou can’t think that! I shall read it.”\\n\\n“All that is not in the article, there’s only a hint of it,” said\\nRaskolnikov.\\n\\n“Yes, yes.” Porfiry couldn’t sit still. “Your attitude to crime is\\npretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence (I am\\nreally ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you’ve removed\\nmy anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various\\npractical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth\\nimagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and\\nsuppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great\\nenterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...\\ndo you see?”\\n\\nZametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even\\nraise his eyes to him.\\n\\n“I must admit,” he went on calmly, “that such cases certainly must\\narise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that\\nsnare; young people especially.”\\n\\n“Yes, you see. Well then?”\\n\\n“What then?” Raskolnikov smiled in reply; “that’s not my fault. So it is\\nand so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)\\nthat I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,\\nbanishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There’s no need to\\nbe uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.”\\n\\n“And what if we do catch him?”\\n\\n“Then he gets what he deserves.”\\n\\n“You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?”\\n\\n“Why do you care about that?”\\n\\n“Simply from humanity.”\\n\\n“If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his\\npunishment--as well as the prison.”\\n\\n“But the real geniuses,” asked Razumihin frowning, “those who have\\nthe right to murder? Oughtn’t they to suffer at all even for the blood\\nthey’ve shed?”\\n\\n“Why the word _ought_? It’s not a matter of permission or prohibition.\\nHe will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are\\nalways inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The\\nreally great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth,” he added\\ndreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.\\n\\nHe raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his\\ncap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and\\nhe felt this. Everyone got up.\\n\\n“Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,” Porfiry\\nPetrovitch began again, “but I can’t resist. Allow me one little\\nquestion (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I\\nwant to express, simply that I may not forget it.”\\n\\n“Very good, tell me your little notion,” Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale\\nand grave before him.\\n\\n“Well, you see... I really don’t know how to express it properly....\\nIt’s a playful, psychological idea.... When you were writing your\\narticle, surely you couldn’t have helped, he-he! fancying yourself...\\njust a little, an ‘extraordinary’ man, uttering a _new word_ in your\\nsense.... That’s so, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Quite possibly,” Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.\\n\\nRazumihin made a movement.\\n\\n“And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties\\nand hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...\\nFor instance, to rob and murder?”\\n\\nAnd again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as\\nbefore.\\n\\n“If I did I certainly should not tell you,” Raskolnikov answered with\\ndefiant and haughty contempt.\\n\\n“No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary\\npoint of view...”\\n\\n“Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!” Raskolnikov thought with\\nrepulsion.\\n\\n“Allow me to observe,” he answered dryly, “that I don’t consider myself\\na Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being\\none of them I cannot tell you how I should act.”\\n\\n“Oh, come, don’t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?”\\n Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.\\n\\nSomething peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.\\n\\n“Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona\\nIvanovna last week?” Zametov blurted out from the corner.\\n\\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.\\nRazumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing\\nsomething. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy\\nsilence. Raskolnikov turned to go.\\n\\n“Are you going already?” Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with\\nexcessive politeness. “Very, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your\\nrequest, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still,\\ncome to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed. I shall\\nbe there at eleven o’clock for certain. We’ll arrange it all; we’ll have\\na talk. As one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able to\\ntell us something,” he added with a most good-natured expression.\\n\\n“You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?” Raskolnikov asked\\nsharply.\\n\\n“Oh, why? That’s not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me.\\nI lose no opportunity, you see, and... I’ve talked with all who had\\npledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the\\nlast.... Yes, by the way,” he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, “I\\njust remember, what was I thinking of?” he turned to Razumihin, “you\\nwere talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know\\nvery well,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but\\nwhat is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point,\\nthis is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very\\nmoment he spoke that he need not have said it.\\n\\n“Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn’t you see in\\na flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen\\nor at least one of them? They were painting there, didn’t you notice\\nthem? It’s very, very important for them.”\\n\\n“Painters? No, I didn’t see them,” Raskolnikov answered slowly, as\\nthough ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking\\nevery nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as\\npossible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. “No, I didn’t\\nsee them, and I don’t think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on\\nthe fourth storey” (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)\\n“I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona\\nIvanovna’s.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters\\nwere carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But\\npainters... no, I don’t remember that there were any painters, and I\\ndon’t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had\\nreflected and realised. “Why, it was on the day of the murder the\\npainters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you\\nasking?”\\n\\n“Foo! I have muddled it!” Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.\\n“Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!” he addressed\\nRaskolnikov somewhat apologetically. “It would be such a great thing for\\nus to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at\\nthe flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... I\\nquite muddled it.”\\n\\n“Then you should be more careful,” Razumihin observed grimly.\\n\\nThe last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them\\nto the door with excessive politeness.\\n\\nThey went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they\\ndid not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n“I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumihin, trying in\\nperplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments.\\n\\nThey were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin\\nkept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited\\nby the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about\\n_it_.\\n\\n“Don’t believe it, then!” answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless\\nsmile. “You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every\\nword.”\\n\\n“You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h’m...\\ncertainly, I agree, Porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and still\\nmore that wretch Zametov!... You are right, there was something about\\nhim--but why? Why?”\\n\\n“He has changed his mind since last night.”\\n\\n“Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do\\ntheir utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you\\nafterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless.”\\n\\n“If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for\\nsuspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,\\nin the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago\\nbesides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all\\nambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by\\nimpudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted\\nit out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an\\nintelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to\\nknow. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome\\nexplaining it all. Stop!”\\n\\n“And it’s insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have\\nspoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I\\nam glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,\\nthis idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an\\ninsinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you\\nknew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,\\nunhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious\\nillness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to\\nspeak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to\\nface some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and\\nthe unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presented\\nby Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling\\natmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person\\nwhere he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he\\nmight well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it\\nall on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,\\nRodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,\\nand spit a dozen times in all directions. I’d hit out in all\\ndirections, neatly too, and so I’d put an end to it. Damn them! Don’t be\\ndownhearted. It’s a shame!”\\n\\n“He really has put it well, though,” Raskolnikov thought.\\n\\n“Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?” he said with\\nbitterness. “Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel\\nvexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the\\nrestaurant....”\\n\\n“Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, as\\none of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And\\nas for Zametov...”\\n\\n“At last he sees through him!” thought Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Stay!” cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. “Stay! you\\nwere wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?\\nYou say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had\\ndone _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...\\nand the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if\\nyou had seen it. Who would own it against himself?”\\n\\n“If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had\\nseen the workmen and the flat,” Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance\\nand obvious disgust.\\n\\n“But why speak against yourself?”\\n\\n“Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny\\neverything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed\\nand experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts\\nthat can’t be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will\\nintroduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another\\nsignificance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon\\nthat I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an\\nair of truth, and then make some explanation.”\\n\\n“But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been\\nthere two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on\\nthe day of the murder at eight o’clock. And so he would have caught you\\nover a detail.”\\n\\n“Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to\\nreflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and\\nso would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days\\nbefore.”\\n\\n“But how could you forget it?”\\n\\n“Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most\\neasily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he\\nwill be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler\\nthe trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you\\nthink....”\\n\\n“He is a knave then, if that is so!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he was\\nstruck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness\\nwith which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the\\npreceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,\\nfrom necessity.\\n\\n“I am getting a relish for certain aspects!” he thought to himself.\\nBut almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an\\nunexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on\\nincreasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev’s.\\n\\n“Go in alone!” said Raskolnikov suddenly. “I will be back directly.”\\n\\n“Where are you going? Why, we are just here.”\\n\\n“I can’t help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them.”\\n\\n“Say what you like, I will come with you.”\\n\\n“You, too, want to torture me!” he screamed, with such bitter\\nirritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin’s hands dropped.\\nHe stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov\\nstriding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting\\nhis teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry\\nlike a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.\\n\\nWhen Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was\\nbreathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his\\nunlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror\\nhe rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put\\nthe things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the\\nhole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up\\nand drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev’s, he\\nsuddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper\\nin which they had been wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it,\\nmight somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then\\nmight suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.\\n\\nHe stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half\\nsenseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went\\nquietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily\\nthrough the gateway.\\n\\n“Here he is himself,” shouted a loud voice.\\n\\nHe raised his head.\\n\\nThe porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing\\nhim out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat\\nand a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He\\nstooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled\\nflabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and\\nthey looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.\\n\\n“What is it?” Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.\\n\\nThe man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him\\nattentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the\\ngate into the street without saying a word.\\n\\n“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your\\nname and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and\\nhe went away. It’s funny.”\\n\\nThe porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after\\nwondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.\\n\\nRaskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of\\nhim walking along the other side of the street with the same even,\\ndeliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in\\nmeditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.\\nAt last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man\\nnoticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;\\nand so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.\\n\\n“You were inquiring for me... of the porter?” Raskolnikov said at last,\\nbut in a curiously quiet voice.\\n\\nThe man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him. Again they were both\\nsilent.\\n\\n“Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What’s the\\nmeaning of it?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words\\nclearly.\\n\\nThe man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at\\nRaskolnikov.\\n\\n“Murderer!” he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.\\n\\nRaskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a\\ncold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for\\na moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So\\nthey walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.\\n\\nThe man did not look at him.\\n\\n“What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?” muttered\\nRaskolnikov hardly audibly.\\n\\n“_You_ are a murderer,” the man answered still more articulately and\\nemphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked\\nstraight into Raskolnikov’s pale face and stricken eyes.\\n\\nThey had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left\\nwithout looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after\\nhim. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still\\nstanding there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that\\nhe was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.\\n\\nWith slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way\\nback to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap\\nand put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.\\nThen he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he\\nstretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.\\n\\nHe thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some\\nimages without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of\\npeople he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would\\nnever have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table\\nin a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars\\nin some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite\\ndark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the\\nSunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one\\nanother, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried\\nto clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression\\nwithin him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even\\npleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too\\nwas an almost pleasant sensation.\\n\\nHe heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and\\npretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some\\ntime in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into\\nthe room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s\\nwhisper:\\n\\n“Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.”\\n\\n“Quite so,” answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the\\ndoor. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on\\nhis back again, clasping his hands behind his head.\\n\\n“Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,\\nwhat did he see? He has seen it all, that’s clear. Where was he then?\\nAnd from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?\\nAnd how could he see? Is it possible? Hm...” continued Raskolnikov,\\nturning cold and shivering, “and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the\\ndoor--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you\\ncan build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it\\npossible?” He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he\\nhad become. “I ought to have known it,” he thought with a bitter smile.\\n“And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an\\naxe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did\\nknow!” he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some\\nthought.\\n\\n“No, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is\\npermitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in\\nEgypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off\\nwith a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and\\nso _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but\\nof bronze!”\\n\\nOne sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the\\npyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with\\na red trunk under her bed--it’s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to\\ndigest! How can they digest it! It’s too inartistic. “A Napoleon creep\\nunder an old woman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!”\\n\\nAt moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish\\nexcitement. “The old woman is of no consequence,” he thought, hotly and\\nincoherently. “The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not\\nwhat matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to\\noverstep.... I didn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the\\nprinciple, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was\\nonly capable of killing. And it seems I wasn’t even capable of that...\\nPrinciple? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are\\nindustrious, commercial people; ‘the happiness of all’ is their case.\\nNo, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I\\ndon’t want to wait for ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself,\\nor else better not live at all. I simply couldn’t pass by my mother\\nstarving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the\\n‘happiness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness of\\nall and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only\\nlive once, I too want.... Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing\\nmore,” he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. “Yes, I am certainly a\\nlouse,” he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing\\nwith it with vindictive pleasure. “In the first place, because I can\\nreason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been\\ntroubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for\\nmy own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble\\nobject--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as\\npossible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked\\nout the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I\\nneeded for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone\\nto a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I\\nam utterly a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “is that I am\\nperhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt\\nbeforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can\\nanything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The\\nabjectness! I understand the ‘prophet’ with his sabre, on his steed:\\nAllah commands and ‘trembling’ creation must obey! The ‘prophet’ is\\nright, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up\\nthe innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! It’s for you to\\nobey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that’s not for\\nyou!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!”\\n\\nHis hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his\\neyes were fixed on the ceiling.\\n\\n“Mother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate\\nthem, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can’t bear them near me....\\nI went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her\\nand think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That’s just what\\nI might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am,” he added, straining\\nhimself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. “Ah, how I hate\\nthe old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!\\nPoor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It’s strange though, why is it\\nI scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn’t killed her? Lizaveta!\\nSonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don’t\\nthey weep? Why don’t they moan? They give up everything... their eyes\\nare soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia!”\\n\\nHe lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn’t remember\\nhow he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen\\nand the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a\\npeculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the\\nstreet; workmen and business people were making their way home; other\\npeople had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and\\nstagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was\\ndistinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do\\nsomething in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he\\nstood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,\\nbeckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and\\nwalked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to\\nhim. “Stay, did he really beckon?” Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried\\nto overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and\\nwas frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long\\ncoat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;\\nthey went down a turning; the man still did not look round. “Does he\\nknow I am following him?” thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the\\ngateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in\\nto see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard\\nthe man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at\\nonce followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have\\ngone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard\\nslow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely\\nfamiliar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone\\nthrough the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he\\nreached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were\\nat work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps\\nof the man above had died away. “So he must have stopped or hidden\\nsomewhere.” He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a\\nstillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own\\nfootsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be\\nhiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he\\nhesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as\\nthough everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour\\nwhich was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the\\nchairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the\\nframes. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.\\n“It’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,” thought\\nRaskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more\\nsilent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was\\npainful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp\\ncrack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly\\nflew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At\\nthat moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little\\ncupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. “Why is that cloak\\nhere?” he thought, “it wasn’t there before....” He went up to it quietly\\nand felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved\\nthe cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent\\ndouble so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over\\nher. “She is afraid,” he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the\\nnoose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange\\nto say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was\\nfrightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,\\nbent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up\\ninto her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old\\nwoman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing\\nher utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door\\nfrom the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and\\nwhispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the\\nold woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe\\nthe laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old\\nwoman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the\\npassage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the\\nlanding, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of\\nheads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.\\nSomething gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they\\nwould not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.\\n\\nHe drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:\\nhis door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the\\ndoorway watching him intently.\\n\\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them\\nagain. He lay on his back without stirring.\\n\\n“Is it still a dream?” he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly\\nperceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching\\nhim.\\n\\nHe stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after\\nhim, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on\\nRaskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he\\nput his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane\\nand his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait\\nindefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen\\nglances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost\\nwhitish beard.\\n\\nTen minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There\\nwas complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.\\nOnly a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was\\nunbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.\\n\\n“Come, tell me what you want.”\\n\\n“I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending,” the stranger answered\\noddly, laughing calmly. “Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to\\nintroduce myself....”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART IV\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n“Can this be still a dream?” Raskolnikov thought once more.\\n\\nHe looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.\\n\\n“Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can’t be!” he said at last aloud in\\nbewilderment.\\n\\nHis visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.\\n\\n“I’ve come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I wanted to make\\nyour personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about\\nyou that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope\\nthat you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the\\nwelfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she\\nmight not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,\\nbut with your assistance I reckon on...”\\n\\n“You reckon wrongly,” interrupted Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov made no reply.\\n\\n“It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well,\\nlet me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don’t consider it necessary\\nto justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly\\ncriminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,\\nwith common sense?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.\\n\\n“That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and ‘insulted her\\nwith my infamous proposals’--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) But\\nyou’ve only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a\\nword, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which\\ndoes not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the\\nmost natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself\\na victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of my\\npassion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished\\nthe deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting\\nour mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,\\nprobably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!”\\n\\n“But that’s not the point,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. “It’s\\nsimply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. We don’t\\nwant to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.\\n\\n“But you’re... but there’s no getting round you,” he said, laughing in\\nthe frankest way. “I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right\\nline at once!”\\n\\n“But you are trying to get round me still!”\\n\\n“What of it? What of it?” cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly. “But this\\nis what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of\\ndeception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I\\nrepeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for\\nwhat happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna...”\\n\\n“You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?” Raskolnikov\\ninterrupted rudely.\\n\\n“Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then? You’d be sure to, though.... But\\nas for your question, I really don’t know what to say, though my own\\nconscience is quite at rest on that score. Don’t suppose that I am in\\nany apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medical\\ninquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy\\ndinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing\\nelse. But I’ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on\\nmy way here in the train, especially: didn’t I contribute to all that...\\ncalamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the\\nsort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the\\nquestion.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov laughed.\\n\\n“I wonder you trouble yourself about it!”\\n\\n“But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her just twice\\nwith a switch--there were no marks even... don’t regard me as a cynic,\\nplease; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;\\nbut I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased\\nat my, so to say, warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to\\nthe last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to\\nsit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides,\\nshe had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the\\nletter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her\\nfirst act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak\\nof the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be\\ninsulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances\\nof it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to\\nbe insulted, have you noticed that? But it’s particularly so with women.\\nOne might even say it’s their only amusement.”\\n\\nAt one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so\\nfinishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence\\nmade him linger for a moment.\\n\\n“You are fond of fighting?” he asked carelessly.\\n\\n“No, not very,” Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. “And Marfa Petrovna and\\nI scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she was always\\npleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not\\ncounting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first\\ntime, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the\\ncountry, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you\\nsuppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?\\nHa, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years\\nago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve forgotten\\nhis name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having\\nthrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in\\nthose days, that very year I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the\\n_Age_’ took place (you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading,\\nyou remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,\\nwhere are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,\\nI feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there\\nfor sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking\\n‘Germans’ that I don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite\\nanswer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view\\nthen, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I assure you.”\\n\\nAfter saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.\\nRaskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his\\nmind and able to keep it to himself.\\n\\n“I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?” he asked.\\n\\n“Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an\\nadaptable man?”\\n\\n“No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man.”\\n\\n“Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is that\\nit? But why take offence? As you asked, so I answered,” he replied,\\nwith a surprising expression of simplicity. “You know, there’s\\nhardly anything I take interest in,” he went on, as it were dreamily,\\n“especially now, I’ve nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to\\nimagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as\\nI told you I want to see your sister about something. But I’ll confess\\nfrankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I am\\ndelighted to see you.... Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you\\nseem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, there’s\\nsomething wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,\\nbut now, generally.... Well, well, I won’t, I won’t, don’t scowl! I am\\nnot such a bear, you know, as you think.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov looked gloomily at him.\\n\\n“You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,” he said. “I fancy indeed that\\nyou are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to\\nbehave like one.”\\n\\n“I am not particularly interested in anyone’s opinion,” Svidrigaïlov\\nanswered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, “and therefore why\\nnot be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our\\nclimate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,” he\\nadded, laughing again.\\n\\n“But I’ve heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, ‘not\\nwithout connections.’ What can you want with me, then, unless you’ve\\nsome special object?”\\n\\n“That’s true that I have friends here,” Svidrigaïlov admitted, not\\nreplying to the chief point. “I’ve met some already. I’ve been lounging\\nabout for the last three days, and I’ve seen them, or they’ve seen me.\\nThat’s a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor\\nman; the emancipation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property\\nconsists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not\\nfallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long\\nago. I’ve been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town\\nit is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town of\\nofficials and students of all sorts. Yes, there’s a great deal I didn’t\\nnotice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My only\\nhope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!”\\n\\n“Anatomy?”\\n\\n“But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,\\nmaybe--well, all that can go on without me,” he went on, again without\\nnoticing the question. “Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?”\\n\\n“Why, have you been a card-sharper then?”\\n\\n“How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the best\\nsociety, eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding,\\nyou know, poets, men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russian\\nsociety the best manners are found among those who’ve been thrashed,\\nhave you noticed that? I’ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get\\ninto prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. Then\\nMarfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for\\nthirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were united\\nin lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.\\nYou know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. For\\nseven years I never left the country. And, take note, that all my life\\nshe held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so\\nif I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at\\nonce! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in\\nthat.”\\n\\n“If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the slip?”\\n\\n“I don’t know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I\\ndidn’t want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go\\nabroad, seeing I was bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always\\nfelt sick there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the\\nsea--you look at them and it makes you sad. What’s most revolting is\\nthat one is really sad! No, it’s better at home. Here at least one\\nblames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have gone\\nperhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _j’ai le vin\\nmauvais_ and hate drinking, and there’s nothing left but wine. I have\\ntried it. But, I say, I’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon\\nnext Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a\\nfee. Is it true?”\\n\\n“Why, would you go up?”\\n\\n“I... No, oh, no,” muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in\\nthought.\\n\\n“What does he mean? Is he in earnest?” Raskolnikov wondered.\\n\\n“No, the document didn’t restrain me,” Svidrigaïlov went on,\\nmeditatively. “It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly\\na year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day\\nand made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too. She had a\\nfortune, you know. ‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’--that\\nwas actually her expression. You don’t believe she used it? But do\\nyou know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the\\nneighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved,\\nbut afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying.”\\n\\n“You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?”\\n\\n“Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you\\nbelieve in ghosts?”\\n\\n“What ghosts?”\\n\\n“Why, ordinary ghosts.”\\n\\n“Do you believe in them?”\\n\\n“Perhaps not, _pour vous plaire_.... I wouldn’t say no exactly.”\\n\\n“Do you see them, then?”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.\\n\\n“Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,” he said, twisting his mouth\\ninto a strange smile.\\n\\n“How do you mean ‘she is pleased to visit you’?”\\n\\n“She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the\\nfuneral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to\\ncome here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on\\nthe journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two\\nhours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone.”\\n\\n“Were you awake?”\\n\\n“Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for\\na minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear\\nher.”\\n\\n“What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to\\nyou?” Raskolnikov said suddenly.\\n\\nAt the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much\\nexcited.\\n\\n“What! Did you think so?” Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment. “Did you\\nreally? Didn’t I say that there was something in common between us, eh?”\\n\\n“You never said so!” Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.\\n\\n“Didn’t I?”\\n\\n“No!”\\n\\n“I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,\\npretending, I said to myself at once, ‘Here’s the man.’”\\n\\n“What do you mean by ‘the man?’ What are you talking about?” cried\\nRaskolnikov.\\n\\n“What do I mean? I really don’t know....” Svidrigaïlov muttered\\ningenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.\\n\\nFor a minute they were silent. They stared in each other’s faces.\\n\\n“That’s all nonsense!” Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. “What does she\\nsay when she comes to you?”\\n\\n“She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man\\nis a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I\\nwas tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch\\nafterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and\\nbegan to think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day,\\nArkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,’\\nshe said. All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if\\nI forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way\\nhere. I got out at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out,\\nwith my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and\\nthere was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of\\ncards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady\\nIvanovitch?’ She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never\\nforgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,\\nbesides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a\\nmiserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden\\nMarfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress\\nwith a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my\\ndress? Aniska can’t make like this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the\\ncountry, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a\\npretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,\\nand then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. ‘I wonder\\nyou trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good\\ngracious, you won’t let one disturb you about anything!’ To tease her\\nI said, ‘I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you,\\nArkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a\\nbride when you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good\\nchoice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you\\nwill only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’ Then she went out and\\nher train seemed to rustle. Isn’t it nonsense, eh?”\\n\\n“But perhaps you are telling lies?” Raskolnikov put in.\\n\\n“I rarely lie,” answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not\\nnoticing the rudeness of the question.\\n\\n“And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?”\\n\\n“Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had\\na serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting ‘Filka, my\\npipe!’ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat\\nstill and thought ‘he is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a\\nviolent quarrel just before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole\\nin your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and went out,\\nand never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted\\nto have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed.”\\n\\n“You should go to a doctor.”\\n\\n“I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don’t know\\nwhat’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn’t\\nask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you\\nbelieve that they exist.”\\n\\n“No, I won’t believe it!” Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.\\n\\n“What do people generally say?” muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though\\nspeaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. “They say, ‘You\\nare ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not\\nstrictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that\\nonly proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that\\nthey don’t exist.”\\n\\n“Nothing of the sort,” Raskolnikov insisted irritably.\\n\\n“No? You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him\\ndeliberately. “But what do you say to this argument (help me with\\nit): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the\\nbeginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see\\nthem, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the\\nsake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon\\nas one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is\\nbroken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the\\nmore seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one’s contact with that\\nother world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that\\nworld. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you\\ncould believe in that, too.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe in a future life,” said Raskolnikov.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.\\n\\n“And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,”\\n he said suddenly.\\n\\n“He is a madman,” thought Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,\\nsomething vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what\\nif it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black\\nand grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is? I\\nsometimes fancy it like that.”\\n\\n“Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than\\nthat?” Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.\\n\\n“Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know\\nit’s what I would certainly have made it,” answered Svidrigaïlov, with a\\nvague smile.\\n\\nThis horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlov\\nraised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.\\n\\n“Only think,” he cried, “half an hour ago we had never seen each other,\\nwe regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between\\nus; we’ve thrown it aside, and away we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t\\nI right in saying that we were birds of a feather?”\\n\\n“Kindly allow me,” Raskolnikov went on irritably, “to ask you to explain\\nwhy you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,\\nI have no time to waste. I want to go out.”\\n\\n“By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to\\nbe married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?”\\n\\n“Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning\\nher name? I can’t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,\\nif you really are Svidrigaïlov.”\\n\\n“Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning\\nher?”\\n\\n“Very good, speak, but make haste.”\\n\\n“I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.\\nLuzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only\\nseen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no\\nmatch for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing\\nherself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of\\nher family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very\\nglad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly\\nadvantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it.”\\n\\n“All this is very naïve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on\\nyour part,” said Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don’t be uneasy, Rodion\\nRomanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have\\nspoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something\\npsychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for\\nAvdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell you\\nthat I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder\\nmyself indeed, for I really did feel something...”\\n\\n“Through idleness and depravity,” Raskolnikov put in.\\n\\n“I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities\\nthat even I could not help being impressed by them. But that’s all\\nnonsense, as I see myself now.”\\n\\n“Have you seen that long?”\\n\\n“I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the\\nday before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I\\nstill fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya\\nRomanovna’s hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.”\\n\\n“Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object\\nof your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out...”\\n\\n“With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a\\ncertain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary\\narrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided\\nfor; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should\\nmake, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year\\nago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.\\nBefore the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.\\nIt’s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled\\nwith Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.\\nI want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you\\nlike in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she\\nwill never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging\\nher pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten\\nthousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to\\nwhich I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way\\nto it.”\\n\\n“You are certainly mad,” cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as\\nastonished. “How dare you talk like that!”\\n\\n“I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not\\nrich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no\\nneed for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste\\nit in some more foolish way. That’s the first thing. Secondly, my\\nconscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.\\nYou may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will\\nknow. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I\\ngreatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely\\nregretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the\\nunpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show\\nthat I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there\\nwere a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not\\nhave made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand\\nonly, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,\\nvery soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion\\nof any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say that\\nin marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from\\nanother man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly\\nand quietly.”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying\\nthis.\\n\\n“I beg you to say no more,” said Raskolnikov. “In any case this is\\nunpardonable impertinence.”\\n\\n“Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour\\nin this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good\\nby trivial conventional formalities. That’s absurd. If I died, for\\ninstance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she\\nwouldn’t refuse it?”\\n\\n“Very likely she would.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten\\nthousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case I\\nbeg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna.”\\n\\n“No, I won’t.”\\n\\n“In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her\\nmyself and worry her by doing so.”\\n\\n“And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?”\\n\\n“I don’t know really what to say. I should like very much to see her\\nonce more.”\\n\\n“Don’t hope for it.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may become better\\nfriends.”\\n\\n“You think we may become friends?”\\n\\n“And why not?” Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up and took his hat.\\n“I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning\\non it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning.”\\n\\n“Where did you see me this morning?” Raskolnikov asked uneasily.\\n\\n“I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you\\nlike me.... But don’t be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on\\nall right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great\\npersonage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about\\nRaphael’s _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left Marfa\\nPetrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at\\nViazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in\\na balloon with Berg, perhaps.”\\n\\n“Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?”\\n\\n“What travels?”\\n\\n“Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.”\\n\\n“A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that’s a wide\\nsubject.... if only you knew what you are asking,” he added, and gave\\na sudden, loud, short laugh. “Perhaps I’ll get married instead of the\\njourney. They’re making a match for me.”\\n\\n“Here?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“How have you had time for that?”\\n\\n“But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly beg\\nit. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something.\\nTell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered\\nher in her will and left her three thousand roubles. That’s absolutely\\ncertain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was\\ndone in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money\\nin two or three weeks.”\\n\\n“Are you telling the truth?”\\n\\n“Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near you.”\\n\\nAs he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nIt was nearly eight o’clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev’s,\\nto arrive before Luzhin.\\n\\n“Why, who was that?” asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the\\nstreet.\\n\\n“It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister was\\ninsulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with\\nhis attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This\\nMarfa Petrovna begged Dounia’s forgiveness afterwards, and she’s just\\ndied suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don’t\\nknow why I’m afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wife’s\\nfuneral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We\\nmust guard Dounia from him... that’s what I wanted to tell you, do you\\nhear?”\\n\\n“Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya,\\nfor speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her. Where does\\nhe live?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you ask? What a pity! I’ll find out, though.”\\n\\n“Did you see him?” asked Raskolnikov after a pause.\\n\\n“Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.”\\n\\n“You did really see him? You saw him clearly?” Raskolnikov insisted.\\n\\n“Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have\\na good memory for faces.”\\n\\nThey were silent again.\\n\\n“Hm!... that’s all right,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Do you know, I\\nfancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination.”\\n\\n“What do you mean? I don’t understand you.”\\n\\n“Well, you all say,” Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a\\nsmile, “that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad,\\nand have only seen a phantom.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that\\nhappened all these days may be only imagination.”\\n\\n“Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he say, what did\\nhe come for?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.\\n\\n“Now let me tell you my story,” he began, “I came to you, you were\\nasleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry’s, Zametov was\\nstill with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn’t speak in\\nthe right way. They don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but\\nare not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking\\nto him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At\\nlast I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I’d\\nbrain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was\\nall. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn’t say a word. But, you see, I\\nthought I’d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea\\nstruck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger\\nor anything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang for them. We\\nshall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I’d\\nmystify them more than ever. How ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang\\nthem! We can thrash them afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!”\\n\\n“To be sure,” answered Raskolnikov. “But what will you say to-morrow?”\\n he thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had never\\noccurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he\\nthought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his visit\\nto Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone\\nsince then.\\n\\nIn the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually\\nat eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in\\ntogether without greeting or looking at one another. The young men\\nwalked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a\\nlittle in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came\\nforward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her\\nbrother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with\\nredoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though\\nhe were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make\\nthem all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia\\nand Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.\\nRazumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin\\nwas next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.\\n\\nA moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a\\ncambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of\\na benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to\\ninsist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to\\nkeep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp\\nand emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.\\nBut he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure\\nuncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so\\nopenly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was\\nbetter to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and\\nthere would always be time for that.\\n\\n“I trust you had a favourable journey,” he inquired officially of\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.”\\n\\n“I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued\\neither?”\\n\\n“I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great strain for\\nmother,” answered Dounia.\\n\\n“That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.\\n‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all my\\ndesire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all\\npassed off without inconvenience?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,” Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, “and if\\nDmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself,\\nwe should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch\\nRazumihin,” she added, introducing him to Luzhin.\\n\\n“I had the pleasure... yesterday,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a\\nhostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very\\npolite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,\\ndirectly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and\\nbecome more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.\\nAgain all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya\\nRomanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had\\nnothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.\\n\\n“Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?” she began having recourse to\\nher leading item of conversation.\\n\\n“To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to\\nmake you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov\\nset off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So\\nat least I have excellent authority for believing.”\\n\\n“To Petersburg? here?” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the\\nrapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.”\\n\\n“Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even here?” cried\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\n“I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for\\nuneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting\\ninto communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now\\ndiscovering where he is lodging.”\\n\\n“Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have\\ngiven me,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: “I’ve only seen him twice,\\nbut I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the\\ncause of Marfa Petrovna’s death.”\\n\\n“It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I\\ndo not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of\\nevents by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the\\ngeneral conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am\\nin agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and\\nprecisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within\\na very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any\\npecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is\\nthe most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.\\nI have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so\\nunfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years\\nago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions\\nand sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic\\nand homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to\\nSiberia, was hushed up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to\\nknow.”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened\\nattentively.\\n\\n“Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of\\nthis?” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.\\n\\n“I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must\\nobserve that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.\\nThere was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,\\na foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other\\ncommissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close\\nand mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living\\nwith her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than\\nfourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she\\nused to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in\\nthe garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual\\nproceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that\\nthe child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this\\nwas not clearly established, the information was given by another German\\nwoman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement\\nwas actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and\\nexertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very\\nsignificant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were\\nwith them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he\\nreceived six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”\\n\\n“I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.”\\n\\n“Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,\\nto suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.\\nSvidrigaïlov.”\\n\\n“I don’t know that,” answered Dounia, dryly. “I only heard a queer story\\nthat Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,\\nthe servants used to say, ‘he read himself silly,’ and that he hanged\\nhimself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not\\nhis blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they\\nwere actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for\\nPhilip’s death.”\\n\\n“I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his\\ndefence all of a sudden,” Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into\\nan ambiguous smile, “there’s no doubt that he is an astute man, and\\ninsinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has\\ndied so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be\\nof service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed\\nefforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it’s\\nmy firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor’s prison again.\\nMarfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything\\nsubstantial on him, having regard for his children’s interests, and,\\nif she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,\\nsomething insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a\\nman of his habits.”\\n\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,” said Dounia, “say no more of Mr.\\nSvidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable.”\\n\\n“He has just been to see me,” said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for\\nthe first time.\\n\\nThere were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr\\nPetrovitch was roused.\\n\\n“An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and\\nintroduced himself,” Raskolnikov continued. “He was fairly cheerful\\nand at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is\\nparticularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at\\nwhich he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and\\nhe told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa\\nPetrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that\\nyou can receive the money very shortly.”\\n\\n“Thank God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. “Pray for\\nher soul, Dounia!”\\n\\n“It’s a fact!” broke from Luzhin.\\n\\n“Tell us, what more?” Dounia urged Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his\\nchildren who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere\\nnot far from me, but where, I don’t know, I didn’t ask....”\\n\\n“But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?” cried Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna in a fright. “Did he tell you?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“What was it?”\\n\\n“I’ll tell you afterwards.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.\\n\\n“I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in\\nyour way,” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.\\n\\n“Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,” said Dounia, “you intended to spend\\nthe evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an\\nexplanation with mother.”\\n\\n“Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Pyotr Petrovitch answered\\nimpressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. “I\\ncertainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon\\na very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly\\nin my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not\\ndesire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...\\nof certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weighty\\nand urgent request has been disregarded....”\\n\\nAssuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.\\n\\n“Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was\\ndisregarded solely at my insistance,” said Dounia. “You wrote that you\\nhad been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at\\nonce, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you,\\nthen he _should_ and _will_ apologise.”\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.\\n\\n“There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us\\nforget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;\\nand when it has been overstepped, there is no return.”\\n\\n“That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia\\ninterrupted with some impatience. “Please understand that our whole\\nfuture depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as\\nsoon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at\\nit in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this\\nbusiness must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that\\nif my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness.”\\n\\n“I am surprised at your putting the question like that,” said Luzhin,\\ngetting more and more irritated. “Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you,\\nI may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member\\nof your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I\\ncannot accept duties incompatible with...”\\n\\n“Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia\\ninterrupted with feeling, “and be the sensible and generous man I have\\nalways considered, and wish to consider, you to be. I’ve given you a\\ngreat promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe\\nme, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of\\njudge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted\\non his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told\\nhim nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not\\nreconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That\\nis how the question rests on your side and on his. I don’t want to be\\nmistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off\\nwith my brother, for my brother’s sake I must break off with you. I can\\nfind out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to\\nknow it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me,\\nwhether you are the husband for me.”\\n\\n“Avdotya Romanovna,” Luzhin declared huffily, “your words are of too\\nmuch consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view\\nof the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say\\nnothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an\\nimpertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to\\nme. You say ‘you or he,’ showing thereby of how little consequence I\\nam in your eyes... I cannot let this pass considering the relationship\\nand... the obligations existing between us.”\\n\\n“What!” cried Dounia, flushing. “I set your interest beside all that has\\nhitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the _whole_ of\\nmy life, and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of\\nyou.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr\\nPetrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he\\nbecame more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it.\\n\\n“Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to\\noutweigh your love for your brother,” he pronounced sententiously, “and\\nin any case I cannot be put on the same level.... Although I said so\\nemphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother’s presence,\\nnevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary\\nexplanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.\\nYour son,” he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “yesterday in the\\npresence of Mr. Razsudkin (or... I think that’s it? excuse me I have\\nforgotten your surname,” he bowed politely to Razumihin) “insulted me by\\nmisrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation,\\ndrinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had\\nexperience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of\\nview than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable\\nfor the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the\\nsignificance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of\\nmalicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your\\ncorrespondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite\\nconclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know\\nin what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion\\nRomanovitch.”\\n\\n“I don’t remember,” faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “I repeated them as\\nI understood them. I don’t know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps\\nhe exaggerated.”\\n\\n“He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation.”\\n\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, “the\\nproof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is\\nthe fact that we are here.”\\n\\n“Good, mother,” said Dounia approvingly.\\n\\n“Then this is my fault again,” said Luzhin, aggrieved.\\n\\n“Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have\\njust written what was false about him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added,\\ngaining courage.\\n\\n“I don’t remember writing anything false.”\\n\\n“You wrote,” Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, “that I\\ngave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was\\nthe fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).\\nYou wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that\\nobject added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you\\ndon’t know. All that is mean slander.”\\n\\n“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, quivering with fury. “I enlarged upon\\nyour qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your\\nsister’s and mother’s inquiries, how I found you, and what impression\\nyou made on me. As for what you’ve alluded to in my letter, be so good\\nas to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn’t\\nthrow away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that\\nfamily, however unfortunate.”\\n\\n“To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little\\nfinger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones.”\\n\\n“Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and\\nsister?”\\n\\n“I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit down to-day\\nwith mother and Dounia.”\\n\\n“Rodya!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin\\nknitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.\\n\\n“You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,” he said, “whether it is\\npossible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end,\\nonce and for all. I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures\\nof family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets.” He got up from his\\nchair and took his hat. “But in withdrawing, I venture to request\\nthat for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to\\nsay, compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to\\nyou and to no one else.”\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.\\n\\n“You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr\\nPetrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded,\\nshe had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you were\\nlaying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as\\na command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show\\nparticular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown\\nup everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any\\ncase in a sense in your hands.”\\n\\n“That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the\\npresent moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna’s legacy, which\\nseems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me,” he\\nadded sarcastically.\\n\\n“Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were\\nreckoning on our helplessness,” Dounia observed irritably.\\n\\n“But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire\\nnot to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady\\nIvanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has entrusted to your brother and\\nwhich have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest\\nfor you.”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\nRazumihin could not sit still on his chair.\\n\\n“Aren’t you ashamed now, sister?” asked Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“I am ashamed, Rodya,” said Dounia. “Pyotr Petrovitch, go away,” she\\nturned to him, white with anger.\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.\\nHe had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the\\nhelplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned\\npale, and his lips quivered.\\n\\n“Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a\\ndismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back. Consider\\nwhat you are doing. My word is not to be shaken.”\\n\\n“What insolence!” cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. “I don’t\\nwant you to come back again.”\\n\\n“What! So that’s how it stands!” cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the\\nlast moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of\\nhis reckoning now. “So that’s how it stands! But do you know, Avdotya\\nRomanovna, that I might protest?”\\n\\n“What right have you to speak to her like that?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\nintervened hotly. “And what can you protest about? What rights have you?\\nAm I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us altogether!\\nWe are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above\\nall....”\\n\\n“But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,” Luzhin stormed in a\\nfrenzy, “by your promise, and now you deny it and... besides... I have\\nbeen led on account of that into expenses....”\\n\\nThis last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that\\nRaskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,\\ncould not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\\nfurious.\\n\\n“Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the\\nconductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have bound\\nyou! What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us,\\nhand and foot, not we!”\\n\\n“Enough, mother, no more please,” Avdotya Romanovna implored. “Pyotr\\nPetrovitch, do be kind and go!”\\n\\n“I am going, but one last word,” he said, quite unable to control\\nhimself. “Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my\\nmind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread\\nall over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public\\nopinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly\\nmight very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for\\ngratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I see\\nmyself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the\\nuniversal verdict....”\\n\\n“Does the fellow want his head smashed?” cried Razumihin, jumping up.\\n\\n“You are a mean and spiteful man!” cried Dounia.\\n\\n“Not a word! Not a movement!” cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back;\\nthen going close up to Luzhin, “Kindly leave the room!” he said quietly\\nand distinctly, “and not a word more or...”\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that\\nworked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man\\ncarried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against\\nRaskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It is\\nnoteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case\\nwas perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were\\nconcerned, all might “very well indeed” be set right again.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nThe fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an\\nending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that\\ntwo destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. This\\nconviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to\\nthe point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from\\ninsignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest\\nopinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated\\nin solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued\\nabove all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts\\nof devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his\\nsuperiors.\\n\\nWhen he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in\\nspite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity\\nand had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such “black ingratitude.”\\n And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the\\ngroundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere\\ncontradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the\\ntownspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a defence. And he would not have\\ndenied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly\\nof his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as\\nsomething heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret\\nfeeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that\\nothers should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with\\nthe feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good\\ndeeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he\\nconsidered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.\\n\\nDounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.\\nFor many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had\\ngone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profound\\nsecret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),\\nvery young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one\\nwho had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who\\nwould all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him\\nand only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined\\non this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,\\nbehold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and\\neducation of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position\\nhad been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he\\ndreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education\\nand breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would\\nbe slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and\\nwould humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,\\nunbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after long\\nreflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and\\nwas now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his\\ncherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely\\nto be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune\\nin Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The\\nfascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make\\nhis way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing\\nan aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This sudden\\nhorrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a\\nhideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,\\nhad not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried\\naway--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did love\\nDounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all\\nat once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,\\nsmoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop\\nwho was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help\\nrecalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;\\nas though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man\\nhe really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He had, in short, a\\ngreat deal to attend to....\\n\\n*****\\n\\n“No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!” said Dounia, kissing and\\nembracing her mother. “I was tempted by his money, but on my honour,\\nbrother, I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him\\nbefore, nothing would have tempted me! Don’t blame me, brother!”\\n\\n“God has delivered us! God has delivered us!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\\nmuttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what\\nhad happened.\\n\\nThey were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now\\nand then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:\\nshe had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible\\nmisfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express his\\njoy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight\\nhad fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to\\nthem, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to\\nthink of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination\\nrange. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and\\nindifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of\\nLuzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Dounia\\ncould not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna watched him timidly.\\n\\n“What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?” said Dounia, approaching him.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n\\nRaskolnikov raised his head.\\n\\n“He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires\\nto see you once in my presence.”\\n\\n“See her! On no account!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “And how dare he\\noffer her money!”\\n\\nThen Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with\\nSvidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa\\nPetrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.\\n\\n“What answer did you give him?” asked Dounia.\\n\\n“At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said that\\nhe would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.\\nHe assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he\\nhas no feeling for you. He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk\\nwas altogether rather muddled.”\\n\\n“How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did he strike you?”\\n\\n“I must confess I don’t quite understand him. He offers you ten\\nthousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, and\\nin ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says he is going to be\\nmarried and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,\\nand probably a bad one. But it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about\\nit if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused this\\nmoney on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him very\\nstrange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;\\nthat may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems\\nto have made a great impression on him.”\\n\\n“God rest her soul,” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “I shall always,\\nalways pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three\\nthousand! It’s as though it had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this\\nmorning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were\\njust planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man\\nuntil he offered help.”\\n\\nDounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s offer. She still\\nstood meditating.\\n\\n“He has got some terrible plan,” she said in a half whisper to herself,\\nalmost shuddering.\\n\\nRaskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.\\n\\n“I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,” he said to\\nDounia.\\n\\n“We will watch him! I will track him out!” cried Razumihin, vigorously.\\n“I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me\\nhimself just now. ‘Take care of my sister.’ Will you give me leave, too,\\nAvdotya Romanovna?”\\n\\nDounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not\\nleave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the\\nthree thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively\\nconversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,\\nthough he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.\\n\\n“And why, why should you go away?” he flowed on ecstatically. “And what\\nare you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all here\\ntogether and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.\\nFor a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll\\nplan a capital enterprise. Listen! I’ll explain it all in detail to\\nyou, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning,\\nbefore anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must\\nintroduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).\\nThis uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his\\npension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has\\nbeen bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.\\ninterest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last year\\nI had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as\\nhe arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have\\nenough for a start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going\\nto do?”\\n\\nThen Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length\\nthat almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all\\nof what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad\\npublishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give\\na profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been\\ndreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had\\nbeen working in publishers’ offices, and knew three European languages\\nwell, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was\\n“schwach” in German with an object of persuading him to take half his\\ntranslation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and\\nRaskolnikov knew he was lying.\\n\\n“Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief\\nmeans of success--money of our own!” cried Razumihin warmly. “Of course\\nthere will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,\\nI, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And\\nthe great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants\\ntranslating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at\\nonce. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years\\nI’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every\\ndetail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe\\nme! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know--and I kept\\nthe secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles\\nsimply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would\\nnot take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you\\nthink? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate--they are\\nsuch blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,\\nyou trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll begin in a small way and go\\non to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get\\nback our capital.”\\n\\nDounia’s eyes shone.\\n\\n“I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!” she said.\\n\\n“I know nothing about it, of course,” put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\\n“it may be a good idea, but again God knows. It’s new and untried. Of\\ncourse, we must remain here at least for a time.” She looked at Rodya.\\n\\n“What do you think, brother?” said Dounia.\\n\\n“I think he’s got a very good idea,” he answered. “Of course, it’s too\\nsoon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out\\nfive or six books and be sure of success. I know of one book myself\\nwhich would be sure to go well. And as for his being able to manage it,\\nthere’s no doubt about that either. He knows the business.... But we can\\ntalk it over later....”\\n\\n“Hurrah!” cried Razumihin. “Now, stay, there’s a flat here in this\\nhouse, belonging to the same owner. It’s a special flat apart, not\\ncommunicating with these lodgings. It’s furnished, rent moderate,\\nthree rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. I’ll pawn your watch\\nto-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.\\nYou can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But where\\nare you off to, Rodya?”\\n\\n“What, Rodya, you are going already?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in\\ndismay.\\n\\n“At such a minute?” cried Razumihin.\\n\\nDounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. He held his cap in\\nhis hand, he was preparing to leave them.\\n\\n“One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever,” he\\nsaid somewhat oddly. He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a\\nsmile. “But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each\\nother...” he let slip accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it\\nsomehow was uttered aloud.\\n\\n“What is the matter with you?” cried his mother.\\n\\n“Where are you going, Rodya?” asked Dounia rather strangely.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m quite obliged to...” he answered vaguely, as though hesitating\\nwhat he would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in his\\nwhite face.\\n\\n“I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother,\\nand you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. I\\nfeel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come of\\nmyself... when it’s possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me,\\nleave me alone. I decided this even before... I’m absolutely resolved on\\nit. Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be\\nalone. Forget me altogether, it’s better. Don’t inquire about me. When\\nI can, I’ll come of myself or... I’ll send for you. Perhaps it will all\\ncome back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin to\\nhate you, I feel it.... Good-bye!”\\n\\n“Good God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his mother and his sister\\nwere terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also.\\n\\n“Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!” cried his\\npoor mother.\\n\\nHe turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Dounia\\novertook him.\\n\\n“Brother, what are you doing to mother?” she whispered, her eyes\\nflashing with indignation.\\n\\nHe looked dully at her.\\n\\n“No matter, I shall come.... I’m coming,” he muttered in an undertone,\\nas though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of\\nthe room.\\n\\n“Wicked, heartless egoist!” cried Dounia.\\n\\n“He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don’t you see it? You’re\\nheartless after that!” Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing\\nher hand tightly. “I shall be back directly,” he shouted to the\\nhorror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room.\\n\\nRaskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.\\n\\n“I knew you would run after me,” he said. “Go back to them--be with\\nthem... be with them to-morrow and always.... I... perhaps I shall\\ncome... if I can. Good-bye.”\\n\\nAnd without holding out his hand he walked away.\\n\\n“But where are you going? What are you doing? What’s the matter with\\nyou? How can you go on like this?” Razumihin muttered, at his wits’ end.\\n\\nRaskolnikov stopped once more.\\n\\n“Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.\\nDon’t come to see me. Maybe I’ll come here.... Leave me, but _don’t\\nleave_ them. Do you understand me?”\\n\\nIt was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a\\nminute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered\\nthat minute all his life. Raskolnikov’s burning and intent eyes\\ngrew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his\\nconsciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it\\nwere, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,\\nsomething awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....\\nRazumihin turned pale.\\n\\n“Do you understand now?” said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously.\\n“Go back, go to them,” he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went\\nout of the house.\\n\\nI will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,\\nhow he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his\\nillness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every\\nday, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,\\nthat he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the\\nbest doctor, a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin took\\nhis place with them as a son and a brother.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nRaskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia\\nlived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the\\nporter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of\\nKapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard\\nthe entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second\\nfloor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey\\nover the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where\\nto turn for Kapernaumov’s door, a door opened three paces from him; he\\nmechanically took hold of it.\\n\\n“Who is there?” a woman’s voice asked uneasily.\\n\\n“It’s I... come to see you,” answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the\\ntiny entry.\\n\\nOn a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.\\n\\n“It’s you! Good heavens!” cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to\\nthe spot.\\n\\n“Which is your room? This way?” and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at\\nher, hastened in.\\n\\nA minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the\\ncandlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly\\nagitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour\\nrushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She\\nfelt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly\\nand sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.\\n\\nIt was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the\\nKapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.\\nIn the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always\\nkept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.\\nSonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and\\nthis gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking\\nout on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute\\nangle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.\\nThe other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any\\nfurniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,\\nbeside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a\\nblue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other\\nflat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite\\nwall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers\\nlooking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the\\nroom. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the\\ncorners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There\\nwas every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.\\n\\nSonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and\\nunceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble\\nwith terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter\\nof her destinies.\\n\\n“I am late.... It’s eleven, isn’t it?” he asked, still not lifting his\\neyes.\\n\\n“Yes,” muttered Sonia, “oh yes, it is,” she added, hastily, as though in\\nthat lay her means of escape. “My landlady’s clock has just struck... I\\nheard it myself....”\\n\\n“I’ve come to you for the last time,” Raskolnikov went on gloomily,\\nalthough this was the first time. “I may perhaps not see you again...”\\n\\n“Are you... going away?”\\n\\n“I don’t know... to-morrow....”\\n\\n“Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?” Sonia’s voice\\nshook.\\n\\n“I don’t know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I’ve\\ncome to say one word....”\\n\\nHe raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was\\nsitting down while she was all the while standing before him.\\n\\n“Why are you standing? Sit down,” he said in a changed voice, gentle and\\nfriendly.\\n\\nShe sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.\\n\\n“How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand.”\\n\\nHe took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.\\n\\n“I have always been like that,” she said.\\n\\n“Even when you lived at home?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Of course, you were,” he added abruptly and the expression of his face\\nand the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.\\n\\nHe looked round him once more.\\n\\n“You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?”\\n\\n“Yes....”\\n\\n“They live there, through that door?”\\n\\n“Yes.... They have another room like this.”\\n\\n“All in one room?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I should be afraid in your room at night,” he observed gloomily.\\n\\n“They are very good people, very kind,” answered Sonia, who still seemed\\nbewildered, “and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.\\nAnd they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.”\\n\\n“They all stammer, don’t they?”\\n\\n“Yes.... He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too.... It’s not\\nexactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plainly. She is a very\\nkind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven\\nchildren... and it’s only the eldest one that stammers and the others\\nare simply ill... but they don’t stammer.... But where did you hear\\nabout them?” she added with some surprise.\\n\\n“Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you\\nwent out at six o’clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna\\nknelt down by your bed.”\\n\\nSonia was confused.\\n\\n“I fancied I saw him to-day,” she whispered hesitatingly.\\n\\n“Whom?”\\n\\n“Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten\\no’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I\\nwanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....”\\n\\n“You were walking in the streets?”\\n\\n“Yes,” Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and\\nlooking down.\\n\\n“Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?”\\n\\n“Oh no, what are you saying? No!” Sonia looked at him almost with\\ndismay.\\n\\n“You love her, then?”\\n\\n“Love her? Of course!” said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she\\nclasped her hands in distress. “Ah, you don’t.... If you only knew!\\nYou see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you\\nsee... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how\\nkind! Ah, you don’t understand, you don’t understand!”\\n\\nSonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement\\nand distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in\\nher eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that\\nshe was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort\\nof _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in\\nevery feature of her face.\\n\\n“Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,\\nwhat then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so\\nunhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,\\nshe is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness\\neverywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she\\nwouldn’t do wrong. She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for people to\\nbe righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is\\ngood!”\\n\\n“And what will happen to you?”\\n\\nSonia looked at him inquiringly.\\n\\n“They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands\\nbefore, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,\\nhow will it be now?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” Sonia articulated mournfully.\\n\\n“Will they stay there?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,\\nI hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina\\nIvanovna says that she won’t stay another minute.”\\n\\n“How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, don’t talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.” Sonia\\nwas agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other\\nlittle bird were to be angry. “And what could she do? What, what could\\nshe do?” she persisted, getting hot and excited. “And how she cried\\nto-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute she\\nis worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the\\nlunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,\\nweeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the\\nwall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her\\nhopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will\\nborrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and\\nset up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to\\nsuperintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses\\nand hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in\\nher fancies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has been\\nwashing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with\\nher feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this\\nmorning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are\\nquite worn out. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not nearly\\nenough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,\\nyou don’t know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the\\nshopmen because she hadn’t enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....”\\n\\n“Well, after that I can understand your living like this,” Raskolnikov\\nsaid with a bitter smile.\\n\\n“And aren’t you sorry for them? Aren’t you sorry?” Sonia flew at him\\nagain. “Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you’d\\nseen nothing of it, and if you’d seen everything, oh dear! And how\\noften, how often I’ve brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only\\na week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I’ve done it! Ah,\\nI’ve been wretched at the thought of it all day!”\\n\\nSonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.\\n\\n“You were cruel?”\\n\\n“Yes, I--I. I went to see them,” she went on, weeping, “and father said,\\n‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here’s a book.’ He\\nhad a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives\\nthere, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I\\ncan’t stay,’ as I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show\\nKaterina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some\\ncollars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina\\nIvanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself\\nin the glass and was delighted with them. ‘Make me a present of them,\\nSonia,’ she said, ‘please do.’ ‘_Please do_,’ she said, she wanted them\\nso much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old\\nhappy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she\\nhas no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn’t had all these years!\\nAnd she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give\\naway everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I\\nwas sorry to give them. ‘What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?’ I\\nsaid. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave\\nme such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.\\nAnd it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,\\nbut for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,\\nchange it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it’s nothing to you!”\\n\\n“Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?”\\n\\n“Yes.... Did you know her?” Sonia asked with some surprise.\\n\\n“Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon\\ndie,” said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.\\n\\n“Oh, no, no, no!”\\n\\nAnd Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring\\nthat she should not.\\n\\n“But it will be better if she does die.”\\n\\n“No, not better, not at all better!” Sonia unconsciously repeated in\\ndismay.\\n\\n“And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t know,” cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her\\nhands to her head.\\n\\nIt was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and\\nhe had only roused it again.\\n\\n“And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill\\nand are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?” he persisted\\npitilessly.\\n\\n“How can you? That cannot be!”\\n\\nAnd Sonia’s face worked with awful terror.\\n\\n“Cannot be?” Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. “You are not\\ninsured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will\\nbe in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head\\nagainst some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....\\nThen she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the\\nhospital, she will die, and the children...”\\n\\n“Oh, no.... God will not let it be!” broke at last from Sonia’s\\noverburdened bosom.\\n\\nShe listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb\\nentreaty, as though it all depended upon him.\\n\\nRaskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.\\nSonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible\\ndejection.\\n\\n“And can’t you save? Put by for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping\\nsuddenly before her.\\n\\n“No,” whispered Sonia.\\n\\n“Of course not. Have you tried?” he added almost ironically.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.”\\n\\nAnd again he paced the room. Another minute passed.\\n\\n“You don’t get money every day?”\\n\\nSonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.\\n\\n“No,” she whispered with a painful effort.\\n\\n“It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,” he said suddenly.\\n\\n“No, no! It can’t be, no!” Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though\\nshe had been stabbed. “God would not allow anything so awful!”\\n\\n“He lets others come to it.”\\n\\n“No, no! God will protect her, God!” she repeated beside herself.\\n\\n“But, perhaps, there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with a sort\\nof malignance, laughed and looked at her.\\n\\nSonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at\\nhim with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not\\nspeak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.\\n\\n“You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is\\nunhinged,” he said after a brief silence.\\n\\nFive minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not\\nlooking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put\\nhis two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful\\nface. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were\\ntwitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the\\nground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And\\ncertainly he looked like a madman.\\n\\n“What are you doing to me?” she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden\\nanguish clutched at her heart.\\n\\nHe stood up at once.\\n\\n“I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of\\nhumanity,” he said wildly and walked away to the window. “Listen,” he\\nadded, turning to her a minute later. “I said just now to an insolent\\nman that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister\\nhonour making her sit beside you.”\\n\\n“Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?” cried Sonia,\\nfrightened. “Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m... dishonourable....\\nAh, why did you say that?”\\n\\n“It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,\\nbut because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that’s\\ntrue,” he added almost solemnly, “and your worst sin is that you have\\ndestroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn’t that fearful? Isn’t\\nit fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at\\nthe same time you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you\\nare not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,”\\n he went on almost in a frenzy, “how this shame and degradation can exist\\nin you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be\\nbetter, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end\\nit all!”\\n\\n“But what would become of them?” Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with\\neyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.\\n\\nRaskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she\\nmust have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly\\nshe had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that\\nnow she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed\\nthe cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his\\npeculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,\\nand that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought\\nof her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long\\ntortured her. “What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered\\nher from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor\\nlittle orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,\\nknocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.\\n\\nBut, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and\\nthe amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any\\ncase remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she\\nhave remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,\\nsince she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he\\nknew that Sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not\\nunique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her\\ntinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,\\nhave killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her\\nup--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched\\nher mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her\\nheart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....\\n\\n“There are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse,\\nor... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns\\nthe heart to stone.”\\n\\nThe last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was\\nyoung, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing\\nthat the last end was the most likely.\\n\\n“But can that be true?” he cried to himself. “Can that creature who has\\nstill preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last\\ninto that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have\\nbegun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,\\nbecause vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot\\nbe!” he cried, as Sonia had just before. “No, what has kept her from the\\ncanal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she\\nhas not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her\\nmind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?\\nHow can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she\\nis slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she\\nexpect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean madness?”\\n\\nHe stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed\\nbetter than any other. He began looking more intently at her.\\n\\n“So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?” he asked her.\\n\\nSonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.\\n\\n“What should I be without God?” she whispered rapidly, forcibly,\\nglancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.\\n\\n“Ah, so that is it!” he thought.\\n\\n“And what does God do for you?” he asked, probing her further.\\n\\nSonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak\\nchest kept heaving with emotion.\\n\\n“Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!” she cried suddenly, looking\\nsternly and wrathfully at him.\\n\\n“That’s it, that’s it,” he repeated to himself.\\n\\n“He does everything,” she whispered quickly, looking down again.\\n\\n“That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,” he decided, scrutinising\\nher with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.\\nHe gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft\\nblue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that\\nlittle body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed\\nto him more and more strange, almost impossible. “She is a religious\\nmaniac!” he repeated to himself.\\n\\nThere was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every\\ntime he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.\\nIt was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in\\nleather, old and worn.\\n\\n“Where did you get that?” he called to her across the room.\\n\\nShe was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.\\n\\n“It was brought me,” she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking\\nat him.\\n\\n“Who brought it?”\\n\\n“Lizaveta, I asked her for it.”\\n\\n“Lizaveta! strange!” he thought.\\n\\nEverything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every\\nmoment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the\\npages.\\n\\n“Where is the story of Lazarus?” he asked suddenly.\\n\\nSonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was\\nstanding sideways to the table.\\n\\n“Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia.”\\n\\nShe stole a glance at him.\\n\\n“You are not looking in the right place.... It’s in the fourth gospel,”\\n she whispered sternly, without looking at him.\\n\\n“Find it and read it to me,” he said. He sat down with his elbow on the\\ntable, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to\\nlisten.\\n\\n“In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be\\nthere if I am not in a worse place,” he muttered to himself.\\n\\nSonia heard Raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly\\nto the table. She took the book however.\\n\\n“Haven’t you read it?” she asked, looking up at him across the table.\\n\\nHer voice became sterner and sterner.\\n\\n“Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!”\\n\\n“And haven’t you heard it in church?”\\n\\n“I... haven’t been. Do you often go?”\\n\\n“N-no,” whispered Sonia.\\n\\nRaskolnikov smiled.\\n\\n“I understand.... And you won’t go to your father’s funeral to-morrow?”\\n\\n“Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too... I had a requiem\\nservice.”\\n\\n“For whom?”\\n\\n“For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.”\\n\\nHis nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.\\n\\n“Were you friends with Lizaveta?”\\n\\n“Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she\\ncouldn’t.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God.”\\n\\nThe last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new\\nagain: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious\\nmaniacs.\\n\\n“I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It’s infectious!”\\n\\n“Read!” he cried irritably and insistently.\\n\\nSonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read\\nto him. He looked almost with exasperation at the “unhappy lunatic.”\\n\\n“What for? You don’t believe?...” she whispered softly and as it were\\nbreathlessly.\\n\\n“Read! I want you to,” he persisted. “You used to read to Lizaveta.”\\n\\nSonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her\\nvoice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the\\nfirst syllable.\\n\\n“Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany...” she forced\\nherself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an\\noverstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.\\n\\nRaskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him\\nand the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on\\nher doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her\\nto betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these\\nfeelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps\\nfor years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy\\nfather and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of\\nstarving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same\\ntime he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with\\ndread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read\\nto _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of\\nit!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.\\nShe mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on\\nreading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth\\nverse:\\n\\n“And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning\\ntheir brother.\\n\\n“Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met\\nHim: but Mary sat still in the house.\\n\\n“Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother\\nhad not died.\\n\\n“But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give\\nit Thee....”\\n\\nThen she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would\\nquiver and break again.\\n\\n“Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.\\n\\n“Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the\\nresurrection, at the last day.\\n\\n“Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that\\nbelieveth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.\\n\\n“And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest\\nthou this?\\n\\n“She saith unto Him,”\\n\\n(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as\\nthough she were making a public confession of faith.)\\n\\n“Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which\\nshould come into the world.”\\n\\nShe stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went\\non reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and\\nhis eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.\\n\\n“Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at\\nHis feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had\\nnot died.\\n\\n“When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which\\ncame with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,\\n\\n“And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and\\nsee.\\n\\n“Jesus wept.\\n\\n“Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!\\n\\n“And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the\\nblind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!\\nShe was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was\\ngetting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense\\ntriumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy\\ngave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she\\nwas reading by heart. At the last verse “Could not this Man which opened\\nthe eyes of the blind...” dropping her voice she passionately reproduced\\nthe doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who\\nin another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by\\nthunder, sobbing and believing.... “And _he, he_--too, is blinded and\\nunbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At\\nonce, now,” was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy\\nanticipation.\\n\\n“Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a\\ncave, and a stone lay upon it.\\n\\n“Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was\\ndead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been\\ndead four days.”\\n\\nShe laid emphasis on the word _four_.\\n\\n“Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest\\nbelieve, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\\n\\n“Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.\\nAnd Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou\\nhast heard Me.\\n\\n“And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which\\nstand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\\n\\n“And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come\\nforth.\\n\\n“And he that was dead came forth.”\\n\\n(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were\\nseeing it before her eyes.)\\n\\n“Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about\\nwith a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go.\\n\\n“Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which\\nJesus did believed on Him.”\\n\\nShe could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair\\nquickly.\\n\\n“That is all about the raising of Lazarus,” she whispered severely and\\nabruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise\\nher eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was\\nflickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the\\npoverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely\\nbeen reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.\\n\\n“I came to speak of something,” Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He got\\nup and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His face\\nwas particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in\\nit.\\n\\n“I have abandoned my family to-day,” he said, “my mother and sister. I\\nam not going to see them. I’ve broken with them completely.”\\n\\n“What for?” asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and\\nsister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. She\\nheard his news almost with horror.\\n\\n“I have only you now,” he added. “Let us go together.... I’ve come to\\nyou, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!”\\n\\nHis eyes glittered “as though he were mad,” Sonia thought, in her turn.\\n\\n“Go where?” she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.\\n\\n“How do I know? I only know it’s the same road, I know that and nothing\\nmore. It’s the same goal!”\\n\\nShe looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he was\\nterribly, infinitely unhappy.\\n\\n“No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have\\nunderstood. I need you, that is why I have come to you.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand,” whispered Sonia.\\n\\n“You’ll understand later. Haven’t you done the same? You, too, have\\ntransgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laid\\nhands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (it’s all the\\nsame!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you’ll\\nend in the Hay Market.... But you won’t be able to stand it, and if\\nyou remain alone you’ll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad\\ncreature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!”\\n\\n“What for? What’s all this for?” said Sonia, strangely and violently\\nagitated by his words.\\n\\n“What for? Because you can’t remain like this, that’s why! You must look\\nthings straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry\\nthat God won’t allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken\\nto the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, she’ll soon\\ndie and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won’t come to\\ngrief? Haven’t you seen children here at the street corners sent out\\nby their mothers to beg? I’ve found out where those mothers live and in\\nwhat surroundings. Children can’t remain children there! At seven the\\nchild is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of\\nChrist: ‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He bade us honour and love\\nthem, they are the humanity of the future....”\\n\\n“What’s to be done, what’s to be done?” repeated Sonia, weeping\\nhysterically and wringing her hands.\\n\\n“What’s to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that’s all,\\nand take the suffering on oneself. What, you don’t understand? You’ll\\nunderstand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all\\ntrembling creation and all the ant-heap!... That’s the goal, remember\\nthat! That’s my farewell message. Perhaps it’s the last time I shall\\nspeak to you. If I don’t come to-morrow, you’ll hear of it all, and then\\nremember these words. And some day later on, in years to come, you’ll\\nunderstand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I’ll tell you\\nwho killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye.”\\n\\nSonia started with terror.\\n\\n“Why, do you know who killed her?” she asked, chilled with horror,\\nlooking wildly at him.\\n\\n“I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I’m not\\ncoming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you\\nout long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when\\nLizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, don’t shake hands.\\nTo-morrow!”\\n\\nHe went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like\\none insane and felt it. Her head was going round.\\n\\n“Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those\\nwords mean? It’s awful!” But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter\\nher head, not for a moment! “Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He has\\nabandoned his mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And\\nwhat had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot\\nand said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live\\nwithout her.... Oh, merciful heavens!”\\n\\nSonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from\\ntime to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish\\nsleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading\\nthe gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing\\nher feet, weeping.\\n\\nOn the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia’s room\\nfrom Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A\\ncard was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the\\ncanal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the\\nroom’s being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been\\nstanding, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went\\nout he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room\\nwhich adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it\\nto the door that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck him\\nas interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so\\nthat he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for\\ninstance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but\\nmight listen in comfort.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nWhen next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the\\ndepartment of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in\\nto Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:\\nit was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected\\nthat they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, and\\npeople, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually\\npassing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an\\noffice, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had\\nno notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and\\nsuspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some\\nmysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was\\nnothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty\\ndetails, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.\\nHe might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him\\nthat if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the\\nearth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait\\nlike that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at\\neleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply\\nhe knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)\\nand so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom\\nexaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture\\nhad begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his\\nalarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh\\nconflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a\\nrush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at\\nfacing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was\\nmeeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred\\nand was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such\\nthat he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and\\narrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,\\nto watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained\\nnerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.\\n\\nHe found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room\\nneither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that\\nstood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a\\nbookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,\\nof polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,\\nbeyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s entrance\\nPorfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in\\nand they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial\\nand good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that\\nRaskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had\\nbeen thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.\\n\\n“Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain”... began Porfiry,\\nholding out both hands to him. “Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps\\nyou don’t like to be called ‘my dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’--_tout\\ncourt_? Please don’t think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. “In our domain,”\\n the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all\\ncharacteristic signs.\\n\\n“He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it\\nback in time,” struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,\\nbut when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.\\n\\n“I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all\\nright or shall I copy it again?”\\n\\n“What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,” Porfiry\\nPetrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the\\npaper and looked at it. “Yes, it’s all right. Nothing more is needed,”\\n he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.\\n\\nA minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the\\ntable and put it on his bureau.\\n\\n“I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...\\nformally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov\\nwas beginning again. “Why did I put in ‘I believe’” passed through\\nhis mind in a flash. “Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘_I\\nbelieve_’?” came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his\\nuneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the\\nfirst looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that\\nthis was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was\\nincreasing. “It’s bad, it’s bad! I shall say too much again.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered Porfiry\\nPetrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,\\nas it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,\\nat one moment avoiding Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again\\nstanding still and looking him straight in the face.\\n\\nHis fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling\\nfrom one side to the other and rebounding back.\\n\\n“We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a\\ncigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. “You know I am\\nreceiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my\\ngovernment quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to\\nhave some repairs done here. It’s almost finished now.... Government\\nquarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?”\\n\\n“Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost\\nironically.\\n\\n“A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as\\nthough he had just thought of something quite different. “Yes, a capital\\nthing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and\\nstopping short two steps from him.\\n\\nThis stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the\\nserious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.\\n\\nBut this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not\\nresist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.\\n\\n“Tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him\\nand taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. “I believe it’s a\\nsort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating\\nlawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least\\nan irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man\\nthey are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to\\ngive him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn’t\\nthat so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals\\nof the art?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government\\nquarters... eh?”\\n\\nAnd as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;\\na good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his\\nforehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened\\nand he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all\\nover and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced\\nhimself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,\\nbroke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s\\nrepulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and\\nstared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his\\nintentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on\\nboth sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in\\nhis visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with\\nwhich the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant\\nin Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been\\nembarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps\\nfallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here\\nunknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in\\nanother moment would break upon him...\\n\\nHe went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his\\ncap.\\n\\n“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began resolutely, though with considerable\\nirritation, “yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you\\nfor some inquiries” (he laid special stress on the word “inquiries”). “I\\nhave come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow\\nme to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral\\nof that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,” he added,\\nfeeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at\\nhis anger. “I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It’s\\npartly what made me ill. In short,” he shouted, feeling that the phrase\\nabout his illness was still more out of place, “in short, kindly examine\\nme or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the\\nproper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,\\ngood-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.”\\n\\n“Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?”\\n cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off\\nlaughing. “Please don’t disturb yourself,” he began fidgeting from place\\nto place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. “There’s no hurry,\\nthere’s no hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come\\nto see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for\\nmy confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion\\nRomanovitch? That is your name?... It’s my nerves, you tickled me\\nso with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with\\nlaughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I’m\\noften afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I\\nshall think you are angry...”\\n\\nRaskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning\\nangrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.\\n\\n“I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,”\\n Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding\\nhis visitor’s eyes. “You see, I’m a bachelor, a man of no consequence\\nand not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m\\nrunning to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in\\nour Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but\\nrespect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before\\nthey can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit\\nopposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of\\nconversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have\\ntheir subjects of conversation, _c’est de rigueur_, but people of the\\nmiddle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied\\nand awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public\\ninterest, or whether it is we are so honest we don’t want to deceive one\\nanother, I don’t know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it\\nlooks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so\\ndelighted...”\\n\\nRaskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with\\na serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry\\nPetrovitch. “Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly\\nbabble?”\\n\\n“I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a\\nfriend?” Porfiry pattered on, “and you know all these official\\nduties... please don’t mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear\\nfellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is\\nabsolutely indispensable for me. I’m always sitting and so glad to be\\nmoving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I\\nalways intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,\\neven Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have\\nit, modern science... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here, inquiries\\nand all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...\\nI assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for\\nthe interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation\\nyourself just now very aptly and wittily.” (Raskolnikov had made no\\nobservation of the kind.) “One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One\\nkeeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and\\nwe shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for\\nour legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree\\nwith you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that\\nthey begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily\\nput it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous\\ncomparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by ‘government\\nquarters’... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I won’t go on! Ah,\\nby the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just\\nnow, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality?\\nIn many cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets\\na good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allow\\nme to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining\\nlawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of\\ninvestigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!”\\n\\nPorfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled on\\nuttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again\\nreverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room, moving\\nhis fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his\\nright hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations\\nthat were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikov\\nsuddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop\\nfor a moment near the door, as though he were listening.\\n\\n“Is he expecting anything?”\\n\\n“You are certainly quite right about it,” Porfiry began gaily, looking\\nwith extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and\\ninstantly put him on his guard); “certainly quite right in laughing so\\nwittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological\\nmethods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres\\ntoo closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, if\\nI recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to\\nbe a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you’re reading for the law,\\nof course, Rodion Romanovitch?”\\n\\n“Yes, I was...”\\n\\n“Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don’t\\nsuppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish\\nabout crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I\\ntook this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him\\nprematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may\\nbe bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in\\nquite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let him walk\\nabout the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don’t quite understand, so\\nI’ll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, I\\nmay very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! You’re\\nlaughing?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressed\\nlips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch’s.\\n\\n“Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so\\ndifferent. You say ‘evidence’. Well, there may be evidence. But\\nevidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining\\nlawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, so\\nto say, mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence\\nsuch as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!\\nAnd if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_\\nwas the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of\\ngetting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so to\\nspeak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his\\nmind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at\\nSevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright\\nthat the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when\\nthey saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,\\nI am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at\\nleast. You’re laughing, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re\\nright, too. You’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I\\nadmit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the\\ngeneral case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,\\nfor which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at\\nall, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon\\nas it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and\\nsometimes a case unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that\\nsort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I don’t touch\\nhim and don’t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every\\nmoment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and\\nif he is in continual suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his\\nhead. He’ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as\\nplain as twice two are four--it’s delightful. It may be so with a simple\\npeasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a\\ncertain side, it’s a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it’s a very\\nimportant matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then\\nthere are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they\\nare all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer\\nfrom spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it’s\\nno anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk\\nabout for a bit! I know well enough that I’ve caught him and that he\\nwon’t escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A\\nPole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching\\nand have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country\\nperhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.\\nA modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such\\nstrangers as our peasants. He-he! But that’s all nonsense, and on\\nthe surface. It’s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is\\n_psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression!\\nThrough a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go.\\nHave you seen a butterfly round a candle? That’s how he will keep\\ncircling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He’ll\\nbegin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round himself, he’ll worry himself\\nto death! What’s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I\\nonly give him long enough interval.... And he’ll keep circling round\\nme, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! He’ll fly straight into my\\nmouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You\\ndon’t believe me?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with\\nthe same intensity into Porfiry’s face.\\n\\n“It’s a lesson,” he thought, turning cold. “This is beyond the cat\\nplaying with a mouse, like yesterday. He can’t be showing off his power\\nwith no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must\\nhave another object. What is it? It’s all nonsense, my friend, you are\\npretending, to scare me! You’ve no proofs and the man I saw had no\\nreal existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up\\nbeforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you won’t do it! But\\nwhy give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my\\nfriend, you are wrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap\\nfor me... let us see what you have in store for me.”\\n\\nAnd he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times\\nhe longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he\\ndreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked\\nwith foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to\\nspeak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best\\npolicy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be\\nirritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too\\nfreely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for.\\n\\n“No, I see you don’t believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke\\non you,” Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling\\nat every instant and again pacing round the room. “And to be sure you’re\\nright: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in\\nother people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse\\nan old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to\\nsay, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like\\nall young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and\\nthat’s for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as\\nfar as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten\\nNapoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it\\nall out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered\\nwith all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are\\nlaughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!\\nBut I can’t help it, it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science.\\nAnd I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve certainly\\nmissed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my\\nword I ought. I shouldn’t have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a\\nmajor, he-he! Well, I’ll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about\\nthis _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my\\ndear sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they sometimes\\ndeceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking\\nseriously, Rodion Romanovitch” (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who\\nwas scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even\\nhis voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) “Moreover, I’m\\na candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I\\nreally am: I tell you these things for nothing and don’t even expect a\\nreward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid\\nthing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of\\nlife, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a\\npoor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable\\nto be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after\\nall! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s temperament, worse\\nluck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don’t think\\nof that ‘when they overstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly\\nexpressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special\\ncase_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;\\nyou might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at\\nthe most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course\\nthere may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s\\ngiven us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his\\ntemperament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be carried\\naway by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he\\nwill turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will\\nbe _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us\\nan idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think\\ndifferently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like\\nthat at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,\\nspeaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of\\nallegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn’t you take me long\\nago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,\\nthe psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything\\nlike a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so\\npale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t trouble, please,” cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke\\ninto a laugh. “Please don’t trouble.”\\n\\nPorfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.\\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical\\nlaughter.\\n\\n“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though\\nhis legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. “I see clearly at last\\nthat you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister\\nLizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you\\nfind that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then\\nprosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my\\nface and worried...”\\n\\nHis lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain\\nhis voice.\\n\\n“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. “Do\\nyou hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t allow it.”\\n\\n“Good heavens! What does it mean?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently\\nquite frightened. “Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the\\nmatter with you?”\\n\\n“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.\\n\\n“Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, what could we\\nsay to them?” Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face\\nclose to Raskolnikov’s.\\n\\n“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,\\nbut he too spoke in a sudden whisper.\\n\\nPorfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.\\n\\n“Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You’re\\nill!” and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a\\ndecanter of water in the corner. “Come, drink a little,” he whispered,\\nrushing up to him with the decanter. “It will be sure to do you good.”\\n\\nPorfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov\\nwas silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take\\nthe water, however.\\n\\n“Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive yourself out of your\\nmind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some water, do drink a little.”\\n\\nHe forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to\\nhis lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.\\n\\n“Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your illness again,\\nmy dear fellow,” Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,\\nthough he still looked rather disconcerted. “Good heavens, you must\\ntake more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me\\nyesterday--I know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they\\nmade of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been. We\\ndined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands\\nin despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit\\ndown!”\\n\\n“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,”\\n Raskolnikov answered sharply.\\n\\n“You knew?”\\n\\n“I knew. What of it?”\\n\\n“Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;\\nI know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night\\nwhen it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so\\nthat the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I\\nunderstand your state of mind at that time... but you’ll drive yourself\\nmad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your head! You’re full of\\ngenerous indignation at the wrongs you’ve received, first from destiny,\\nand then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to\\nanother to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because\\nyou are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t\\nit? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way you’ll\\nlose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too _good_ a man for such\\na position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your\\nillness is infectious for him... I’ll tell you about it when you are\\nmore yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you\\nlook shocking, do sit down.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In\\namazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who\\nstill seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.\\nBut he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange\\ninclination to believe. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had\\nutterly overwhelmed him. “How can it be, he knows about the flat then,”\\n he thought suddenly, “and he tells it me himself!”\\n\\n“Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a\\ncase of morbid psychology,” Porfiry went on quickly. “A man confessed to\\nmurder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought\\nforward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but\\nonly partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that\\nhe had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it\\ngot on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he\\npersuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court\\nof Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under\\nproper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear\\nfellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse\\nto work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about\\nblood! I’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man\\nis sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the\\nsame with bell-ringing.... It’s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You\\nhave begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced\\ndoctor, what’s the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You\\nwere delirious when you did all this!”\\n\\nFor a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.\\n\\n“Is it possible, is it possible,” flashed through his mind, “that he is\\nstill lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.” He rejected that idea, feeling\\nto what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury\\nmight drive him mad.\\n\\n“I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,” he cried, straining\\nevery faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, “I was quite myself, do you\\nhear?”\\n\\n“Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,\\nyou were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell\\nme! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were\\nactually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,\\nwould you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession\\nof your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be\\npossible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on\\nyour conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.\\nThat’s so, isn’t it?”\\n\\nThere was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on\\nthe sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at\\nhim.\\n\\n“Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he\\ncame of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don’t\\nconceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.\\n\\n“You keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips\\ninto a sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all\\nmy game, that you know all I shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious\\nhimself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. “You want to\\nfrighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...”\\n\\nHe still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of\\nintense hatred in his eyes.\\n\\n“You keep lying,” he said. “You know perfectly well that the best\\npolicy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to\\nconceal as little as possible. I don’t believe you!”\\n\\n“What a wily person you are!” Porfiry tittered, “there’s no catching\\nyou; you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t believe me? But still you\\ndo believe me, you believe a quarter; I’ll soon make you believe the\\nwhole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you\\ngood.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov’s lips trembled.\\n\\n“Yes, I do,” went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you\\nmust take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are here\\nnow; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do\\nnothing but frighten them...”\\n\\n“What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of\\nyours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?”\\n\\n“Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don’t\\nnotice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From\\nRazumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,\\nyou interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your\\nsuspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return\\nto bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a\\nprecious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),\\nand you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,\\nshould I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed your\\nsuspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted\\nyour attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your\\nexpression) saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or\\nnearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why did you ring the bell\\nand why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters\\nto go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how\\nI ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to\\nhave taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps\\nhave arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have\\nnot done that! But you can’t look at it normally and you see nothing, I\\nsay again.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to\\nperceive it.\\n\\n“You are lying all the while,” he cried, “I don’t know your object,\\nbut you are lying. You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be\\nmistaken!”\\n\\n“I am lying?” Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving\\na good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least\\nconcerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion of him. “I am lying... but how did\\nI treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving\\nyou every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,\\nmelancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!\\nThough, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very\\nreliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don’t remember--that’s\\nall right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium\\nwere you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There\\nmay have been others, eh? He-he-he!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.\\n\\n“Briefly,” he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so\\ndoing pushing Porfiry back a little, “briefly, I want to know, do you\\nacknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, Porfiry\\nPetrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!”\\n\\n“What a business I’m having with you!” cried Porfiry with a perfectly\\ngood-humoured, sly and composed face. “And why do you want to know, why\\ndo you want to know so much, since they haven’t begun to worry you? Why,\\nyou are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Why\\ndo you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!”\\n\\n“I repeat,” Raskolnikov cried furiously, “that I can’t put up with it!”\\n\\n“With what? Uncertainty?” interrupted Porfiry.\\n\\n“Don’t jeer at me! I won’t have it! I tell you I won’t have it. I can’t\\nand I won’t, do you hear, do you hear?” he shouted, bringing his fist\\ndown on the table again.\\n\\n“Hush! Hush! They’ll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care of\\nyourself. I am not joking,” Porfiry whispered, but this time there was\\nnot the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now\\nhe was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all\\nmystification.\\n\\nBut this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell\\ninto actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to\\nspeak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.\\n\\n“I will not allow myself to be tortured,” he whispered, instantly\\nrecognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and\\ndriven to even greater fury by the thought. “Arrest me, search me, but\\nkindly act in due form and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!”\\n\\n“Don’t worry about the form,” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly\\nsmile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. “I invited\\nyou to see me quite in a friendly way.”\\n\\n“I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here,\\nI take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?”\\n\\nHe took up his cap and went to the door.\\n\\n“And won’t you see my little surprise?” chuckled Porfiry, again taking\\nhim by the arm and stopping him at the door.\\n\\nHe seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened\\nRaskolnikov.\\n\\n“What surprise?” he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in\\nalarm.\\n\\n“My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!”\\n (He pointed to the locked door.) “I locked him in that he should not\\nescape.”\\n\\n“What is it? Where? What?...”\\n\\nRaskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was\\nlocked.\\n\\n“It’s locked, here is the key!”\\n\\nAnd he brought a key out of his pocket.\\n\\n“You are lying,” roared Raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you\\ndamned punchinello!” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other\\ndoor, not at all alarmed.\\n\\n“I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray\\nmyself to you...”\\n\\n“Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion\\nRomanovitch. You are in a passion. Don’t shout, I shall call the\\nclerks.”\\n\\n“You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work\\nme into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produce\\nyour facts! I understand it all. You’ve no evidence, you have only\\nwretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you\\nwanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and\\ndeputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?\\nWhere are they? Produce them?”\\n\\n“Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do\\nso would not be acting in form as you say, you don’t know the business,\\nmy dear fellow.... And there’s no escaping form, as you see,” Porfiry\\nmuttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.\\n\\n“Ah, they’re coming,” cried Raskolnikov. “You’ve sent for them! You\\nexpected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,\\nwhat you like!... I am ready!”\\n\\nBut at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected\\nthat neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for\\nsuch a conclusion to their interview.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nWhen he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.\\n\\nThe noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a\\nlittle.\\n\\n“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. “Why, I gave orders...”\\n\\nFor an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were\\nseveral persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing\\nsomebody back.\\n\\n“What is it?” Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.\\n\\n“The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,” someone answered.\\n\\n“He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What’s he doing here?\\nHow irregular!” cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.\\n\\n“But he...” began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.\\n\\nTwo seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave\\na violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.\\n\\nThis man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared\\nstraight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined\\ngleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his\\nface, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were\\nfaintly twitching.\\n\\nHe was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,\\nslim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom\\nhe had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing\\nhim by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.\\n\\nSeveral persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them\\ntried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.\\n\\n“Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you\\nbrought him so soon?” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,\\nand as it were thrown out of his reckoning.\\n\\nBut Nikolay suddenly knelt down.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” cried Porfiry, surprised.\\n\\n“I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,” Nikolay articulated\\nsuddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.\\n\\nFor ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;\\neven the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and\\nstood immovable.\\n\\n“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary\\nstupefaction.\\n\\n“I... am the murderer,” repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.\\n\\n“What... you... what... whom did you kill?” Porfiry Petrovitch was\\nobviously bewildered.\\n\\nNikolay again was silent for a moment.\\n\\n“Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with\\nan axe. Darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.\\n\\nHe still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some\\nmoments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back\\nthe uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.\\nThen he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,\\nstaring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,\\nlooked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and\\nseeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.\\n\\n“You’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily. “I\\ndidn’t ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?”\\n\\n“I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,” Nikolay pronounced.\\n\\n“Ach! What did you kill them with?”\\n\\n“An axe. I had it ready.”\\n\\n“Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?”\\n\\nNikolay did not understand the question.\\n\\n“Did you do it alone?”\\n\\n“Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”\\n\\n“Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs\\nlike that at the time? The porters met you both!”\\n\\n“It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied\\nhurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.\\n\\n“I knew it!” cried Porfiry, with vexation. “It’s not his own tale he is\\ntelling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested\\non Raskolnikov again.\\n\\nHe was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had\\nforgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.\\n\\n“My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!” he flew up to him, “this won’t\\ndo; I’m afraid you must go... it’s no good your staying... I will...\\nyou see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!”\\n\\nAnd taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.\\n\\n“I suppose you didn’t expect it?” said Raskolnikov who, though he had\\nnot yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.\\n\\n“You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is\\ntrembling! He-he!”\\n\\n“You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!”\\n\\n“Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.”\\n\\nThey were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to\\nbe gone.\\n\\n“And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”\\n Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.\\n\\n“Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical\\nperson! Come, till we meet!”\\n\\n“I believe we can say _good-bye_!”\\n\\n“That’s in God’s hands,” muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.\\n\\nAs he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people\\nwere looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,\\nwhom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there\\nwaiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of\\nPorfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running\\nafter him, out of breath.\\n\\n“One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in God’s hands,\\nbut as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask\\nyou... so we shall meet again, shan’t we?”\\n\\nAnd Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.\\n\\n“Shan’t we?” he added again.\\n\\nHe seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.\\n\\n“You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I\\nlost my temper,” began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage\\nthat he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.\\n\\n“Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,” Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.\\n“I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet\\nagain. If it’s God’s will, we may see a great deal of one another.”\\n\\n“And will get to know each other through and through?” added\\nRaskolnikov.\\n\\n“Yes; know each other through and through,” assented Porfiry Petrovitch,\\nand he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. “Now\\nyou’re going to a birthday party?”\\n\\n“To a funeral.”\\n\\n“Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well.”\\n\\n“I don’t know what to wish you,” said Raskolnikov, who had begun to\\ndescend the stairs, but looked back again. “I should like to wish you\\nsuccess, but your office is such a comical one.”\\n\\n“Why comical?” Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to\\nprick up his ears at this.\\n\\n“Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay\\npsychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have\\nbeen at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and\\nnow that he has confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are\\nlying,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s not\\nyour own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a comical business!”\\n\\n“He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was\\nnot his own tale he was telling?”\\n\\n“How could I help noticing it!”\\n\\n“He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You’ve really a\\nplayful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say\\nthat was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers.”\\n\\n“Yes, of Gogol.”\\n\\n“Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you.”\\n\\n“So shall I.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that\\non getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to\\ncollect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he\\nwas stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,\\namazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s confession\\nwas an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at\\nonce, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they\\nwould be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do\\nsomething for himself, for the danger was imminent.\\n\\nBut how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.\\nRemembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with\\nPorfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,\\nhe did not yet know all Porfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his\\ncalculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew\\nbetter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s “lead” had been for\\nhim. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,\\ncircumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first\\nglance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was\\nbound to win. There’s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\\nhimself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was\\nnothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn’t\\nhe mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some\\nsurprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting\\nsomething or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the\\nunexpected appearance of Nikolay?\\n\\nPorfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked\\nsomething in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his\\nsleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was\\nthat “surprise”? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have\\nconcealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His\\nyesterday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If\\nPorfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....\\n\\nHe sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in\\nhis hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his\\ncap, thought a minute, and went to the door.\\n\\nHe had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might\\nconsider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he\\nwanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna’s. He would be too late for\\nthe funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,\\nand there at once he would see Sonia.\\n\\nHe stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a\\nmoment on to his lips.\\n\\n“To-day! To-day,” he repeated to himself. “Yes, to-day! So it must\\nbe....”\\n\\nBut as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He\\nstarted and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there\\nsuddenly appeared a figure--yesterday’s visitor _from underground_.\\n\\nThe man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,\\nand took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as\\nyesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change\\nin his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put\\nhis hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have\\nlooked exactly like a peasant woman.\\n\\n“What do you want?” asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was\\nstill silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching\\nit with his finger.\\n\\n“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“I have sinned,” the man articulated softly.\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“By evil thoughts.”\\n\\nThey looked at one another.\\n\\n“I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go\\nto the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they\\nlet you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my\\nsleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for\\nyou....”\\n\\n“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.\\n\\n“I did, I’ve wronged you.”\\n\\n“Then you come from that house?”\\n\\n“I was standing at the gate with them... don’t you remember? We have\\ncarried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare\\nhides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed....”\\n\\nAnd the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came\\nclearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recollected that there had\\nbeen several people there besides the porters, women among them.\\nHe remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the\\npolice-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even\\nnow he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round\\nand made him some answer....\\n\\nSo this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most awful thought\\nwas that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself\\non account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell\\nnothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So\\nPorfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this\\n_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no more\\nfacts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... then\\nwhat can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrest\\nhim? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not\\nknown about it before.\\n\\n“Was it you who told Porfiry... that I’d been there?” he cried, struck\\nby a sudden idea.\\n\\n“What Porfiry?”\\n\\n“The head of the detective department?”\\n\\n“Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went.”\\n\\n“To-day?”\\n\\n“I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how he\\nworried you.”\\n\\n“Where? What? When?”\\n\\n“Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.”\\n\\n“What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon my\\nword!”\\n\\n“I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,” began the man;\\n“for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be angry that we did not\\ncome at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making\\ninquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The\\nfirst time I went he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t\\nsee me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him of\\neverything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room\\nand punching himself on the chest. ‘What do you scoundrels mean by it?\\nIf I’d known about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out,\\ncalled somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned\\nto me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I\\ntold him everything, and I told him that you didn’t dare to say a word\\nin answer to me yesterday and that you didn’t recognise me. And he\\nfell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and\\ngetting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told\\nme to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’ he said. ‘Don’t move,\\nwhatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair there for me and locked\\nme in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call you.’ And when Nikolay’d been\\nbrought he let me out as soon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you\\nagain and question you,’ he said.”\\n\\n“And did he question Nikolay while you were there?”\\n\\n“He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay.”\\n\\nThe man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground\\nwith his finger.\\n\\n“Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.”\\n\\n“May God forgive you,” answered Raskolnikov.\\n\\nAnd as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,\\nturned slowly and went out of the room.\\n\\n“It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,” repeated\\nRaskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.\\n\\n“Now we’ll make a fight for it,” he said, with a malicious smile, as he\\nwent down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and\\ncontempt he recollected his “cowardice.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART V\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nThe morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and\\nher mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.\\nIntensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept\\nas a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before\\nfantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been\\ngnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch\\nimmediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had\\njaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at\\nhis noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of\\nlate, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the\\nconviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better\\none. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned\\naside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey\\nSemyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.\\nThat smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his\\nyoung friend’s account. He had set down a good many points against him\\nof late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to\\nhave told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s interview.\\nThat was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness\\nand irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness\\nfollowed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case\\nin the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat\\nwhich had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being\\nredecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,\\nwould not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just\\nbeen signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr\\nPetrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In\\nthe same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the\\ninstalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the\\nflat.\\n\\n“Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?” Pyotr\\nPetrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a\\ngleam of desperate hope. “Can all that be really so irrevocably over?\\nIs it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dounia sent a\\nvoluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,\\nand if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,\\nPyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.\\n\\n“It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as\\nhe returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was I\\nsuch a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny\\nso that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!\\nfoo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau\\nand presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and\\nall that sort of trash from Knopp’s and the English shop, my position\\nwould have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me\\nso easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return\\nmoney and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to\\ndo it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man\\nwho has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H’m! I’ve made a\\nblunder.”\\n\\nAnd grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a\\nfool--but not aloud, of course.\\n\\nHe returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The\\npreparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna’s excited\\nhis curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he\\nfancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares\\nhe had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy\\nlaying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he\\nheard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the\\nlodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead\\nman, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of\\nhis previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,\\nwas not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most\\nimportant of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with\\ngreat ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was\\nvery busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;\\nshe was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she\\nwas proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he\\nwent into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, somewhat thoughtful. He\\nhad learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.\\n\\nAndrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of\\nPyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.\\nPyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay\\nwith him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He\\nhad not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from\\nparsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard\\nof Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young\\nprogressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting\\ncircles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had\\nimpressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who\\ndespised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a\\npeculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form\\neven an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had\\nheard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some\\nsort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and\\ndistorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for\\nmany years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown\\nup_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the\\nthought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of\\nthis as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,\\nwhen he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases\\nin which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,\\nhad been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal\\nfor the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious\\ntrouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the\\nsubject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to\\nanticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of “our younger\\ngeneration.” He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before\\nhis visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current\\nphrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace\\nsimpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he\\nhad been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it\\nwould not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the\\nsystems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for\\nhim. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what\\nwas happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything\\nto fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what\\nprecisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up\\nto them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the\\nthing to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In fact\\nhundreds of questions presented themselves.\\n\\nAndrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely\\nflaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk\\nand had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather\\nsoft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in\\nspeech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.\\nHe was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did\\nnot get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch\\nreally was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress\\nand “our younger generation” from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous\\nand varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,\\nhalf-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in\\nfashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,\\nhowever sincerely.\\n\\nThough Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to\\ndislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.\\nHowever simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr\\nPetrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that “he was\\nnot the right sort of man.” He had tried expounding to him the system of\\nFourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to\\nlisten too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun\\ninstinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace\\nsimpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of\\nany consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up\\nthird-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own\\nwork of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he\\nwould be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr\\nPetrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest\\npraise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,\\nwhen Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to\\nthe establishment of the new “commune,” or to abstain from christening\\nhis future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a\\nmonth after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing\\nhis own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were\\nattributed to him.\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some\\nfive-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over\\nbundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money\\nwalked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank\\nnotes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced\\nPyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money\\nunmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr\\nPetrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and\\nwas, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by\\nreminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.\\n\\nHe found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey\\nSemyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation\\nof a new special “commune.” The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr\\nPetrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame\\nbetrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the “humane” Andrey\\nSemyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-humour to his recent breach\\nwith Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that\\ntheme. He had something progressive to say on the subject which\\nmight console his worthy friend and “could not fail” to promote his\\ndevelopment.\\n\\n“There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the\\nwidow’s, isn’t there?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting\\nAndrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.\\n\\n“Why, don’t you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I think\\nabout all such ceremonies. And she invited you too, I heard. You were\\ntalking to her yesterday...”\\n\\n“I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on\\nthis feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov. I\\nwas surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the\\nwines! Several people are invited. It’s beyond everything!” continued\\nPyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the\\nconversation. “What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I don’t\\nremember. But I shan’t go. Why should I? I only said a word to her in\\npassing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year’s salary as\\na destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me on\\nthat account, hasn’t she? He-he-he!”\\n\\n“I don’t intend to go either,” said Lebeziatnikov.\\n\\n“I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You might well\\nhesitate, he-he!”\\n\\n“Who thrashed? Whom?” cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.\\n\\n“Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so\\nyesterday... so that’s what your convictions amount to... and the woman\\nquestion, too, wasn’t quite sound, he-he-he!” and Pyotr Petrovitch, as\\nthough comforted, went back to clicking his beads.\\n\\n“It’s all slander and nonsense!” cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always\\nafraid of allusions to the subject. “It was not like that at all, it\\nwas quite different. You’ve heard it wrong; it’s a libel. I was simply\\ndefending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled\\nout all my whiskers.... It’s permissable for anyone, I should hope,\\nto defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on\\nprinciple, for it’s an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply\\npushed her back.”\\n\\n“He-he-he!” Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.\\n\\n“You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... But\\nthat’s nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the\\nwoman question! You don’t understand; I used to think, indeed, that\\nif women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is\\nmaintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I\\nreflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,\\nfor there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is\\nunthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality\\nin fighting. I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is\\nfighting... there won’t be later, but at present there is... confound\\nit! How muddled one gets with you! It’s not on that account that I\\nam not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in the\\nrevolting convention of memorial dinners, that’s why! Though, of course,\\none might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there won’t be any priests at\\nit. I should certainly go if there were.”\\n\\n“Then you would sit down at another man’s table and insult it and those\\nwho invited you. Eh?”\\n\\n“Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. I\\nmight indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It’s\\na duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the\\nmore harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... And\\nsomething might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?\\nThey might be offended at first, but afterwards they’d see I’d done them\\na service. You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed\\nbecause when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to\\nher father and mother that she wouldn’t go on living conventionally and\\nwas entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,\\nthat she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think\\nthat’s all nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the contrary,\\nwhat’s wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, she\\nabandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a\\nletter: ‘I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never\\nforgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there\\nis another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have\\nonly lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given\\nmyself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainly\\nbecause I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.\\nDo not hope to get me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.’\\nThat’s how letters like that ought to be written!”\\n\\n“Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?”\\n\\n“No, it’s only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what\\nif it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! And if ever I regretted\\nthe death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think\\nif my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! I\\nwould have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would\\nhave astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!”\\n\\n“To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will,” Pyotr Petrovitch\\ninterrupted, “but tell me this; do you know the dead man’s daughter, the\\ndelicate-looking little thing? It’s true what they say about her, isn’t\\nit?”\\n\\n“What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that\\nthis is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, _distinguons_.\\nIn our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is\\ncompulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,\\nbecause it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she was quite right: she\\nwas suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which\\nshe had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the future\\nsociety there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another\\nsignificance, rational and in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya\\nSemyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against\\nthe organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice\\nindeed when I look at her!”\\n\\n“I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.”\\n\\nLebeziatnikov was enraged.\\n\\n“That’s another slander,” he yelled. “It was not so at all! That was all\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not understand! And I never\\nmade love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely\\ndisinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her\\nprotest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!”\\n\\n“Have you asked her to join your community?”\\n\\n“You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell\\nyou. You don’t understand! There is no such rôle in a community. The\\ncommunity is established that there should be no such rôles. In a\\ncommunity, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid\\nhere is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural\\nbecomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the\\nenvironment. It’s all the environment and man himself is nothing. And\\nI am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof\\nthat she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to\\nattract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.\\nWhat are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of\\nour own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in our\\nconvictions. We reject more! And meanwhile I’m still developing Sofya\\nSemyonovna. She has a beautiful, beautiful character!”\\n\\n“And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-he!”\\n\\n“No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary.”\\n\\n“Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!”\\n\\n“Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it strange myself\\nhow timid, chaste and modern she is with me!”\\n\\n“And you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her\\nthat all that modesty is nonsense?”\\n\\n“Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me saying\\nso--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crude\\nyou still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have\\nonly one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question\\nof chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed\\nprejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that’s for her\\nto decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,\\nI should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but\\nas it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more\\nrespect for her dignity... I wait in hopes, that’s all!”\\n\\n“You had much better make her a present of something. I bet you never\\nthought of that.”\\n\\n“You don’t understand, as I’ve told you already! Of course, she is in\\nsuch a position, but it’s another question. Quite another question!\\nYou simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider\\ndeserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow\\ncreature. You don’t know what a character she is! I am only sorry that\\nof late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used\\nto lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and\\nresolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has\\nlittle self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to\\nbreak free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet she\\nthoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of\\nhands, that is, that it’s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her\\nhand, because it’s a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and\\nI described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of the\\nworkmen’s associations in France, too. Now I am explaining the question\\nof coming into the room in the future society.”\\n\\n“And what’s that, pray?”\\n\\n“We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community\\nthe right to enter another member’s room, whether man or woman, at any\\ntime... and we decided that he has!”\\n\\n“It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!”\\n\\nLebeziatnikov was really angry.\\n\\n“You are always thinking of something unpleasant,” he cried with\\naversion. “Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I\\nreferred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It’s always\\na stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before\\nthey understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I’ve often\\nmaintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till\\nhe has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do you\\nfind so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready\\nto clean out any cesspool you like. And it’s not a question of\\nself-sacrifice, it’s simply work, honourable, useful work which is\\nas good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a\\nPushkin, because it is more useful.”\\n\\n“And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!”\\n\\n“What do you mean by ‘more honourable’? I don’t understand such\\nexpressions to describe human activity. ‘More honourable,’ ‘nobler’--all\\nthose are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is\\n_of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!\\nYou can snigger as much as you like, but that’s so!”\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money\\nand was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The\\n“cesspool question” had already been a subject of dispute between them.\\nWhat was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it\\namused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his\\nyoung friend.\\n\\n“It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and\\nannoying,” blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his “independence”\\n and his “protests” did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still\\nbehaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.\\n\\n“You’d better tell me this,” Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty\\ndispleasure, “can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with\\nthat young person to ask her to step in here for a minute? I think\\nthey’ve all come back from the cemetery... I heard the sound of\\nsteps... I want to see her, that young person.”\\n\\n“What for?” Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.\\n\\n“Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I\\nwanted to speak to her about... However, you may be present during the\\ninterview. It’s better you should be, indeed. For there’s no knowing\\nwhat you might imagine.”\\n\\n“I shan’t imagine anything. I only asked and, if you’ve anything to say\\nto her, nothing is easier than to call her in. I’ll go directly and you\\nmay be sure I won’t be in your way.”\\n\\nFive minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very\\nmuch surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in\\nsuch circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as\\na child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her “politely\\nand affably,” but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in\\nhis opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight\\nin dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. He\\nhastened to “reassure” her and made her sit down facing him at the\\ntable. Sonia sat down, looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes\\nlying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes\\nremained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr\\nPetrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.\\n\\n“Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?” he asked him in a whisper.\\n\\n“Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in....\\nWhy?”\\n\\n“Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave\\nme alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her,\\nbut God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn’t like Raskolnikov to\\nrepeat anything.... You understand what I mean?”\\n\\n“I understand!” Lebeziatnikov saw the point. “Yes, you are right.... Of\\ncourse, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy,\\nbut... still, you are right. Certainly I’ll stay. I’ll stand here at the\\nwindow and not be in your way... I think you are right...”\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked\\nattentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe\\nexpression, as much as to say, “don’t you make any mistake, madam.”\\n Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.\\n\\n“In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your\\nrespected mamma.... That’s right, isn’t it? Katerina Ivanovna stands\\nin the place of a mother to you?” Pyotr Petrovitch began with great\\ndignity, though affably.\\n\\nIt was evident that his intentions were friendly.\\n\\n“Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,” Sonia answered, timidly and\\nhurriedly.\\n\\n“Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevitable\\ncircumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in\\nspite of your mamma’s kind invitation.”\\n\\n“Yes... I’ll tell her... at once.”\\n\\nAnd Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.\\n\\n“Wait, that’s not all,” Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at her\\nsimplicity and ignorance of good manners, “and you know me little, my\\ndear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble\\na person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself\\nonly. I have another object.”\\n\\nSonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on the\\ngrey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she\\nquickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it\\nhorribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person’s\\nmoney. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held\\nin his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a\\nyellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and, not\\nknowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight\\nin the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.\\n\\n“I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with\\nKaterina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me to\\nascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so\\nexpress it.”\\n\\n“Yes... preternatural...” Sonia hurriedly assented.\\n\\n“Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill.”\\n\\n“Yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill.”\\n\\n“Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak\\ncompassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,\\nforeseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of this\\npoverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?”\\n\\n“Allow me to ask,” Sonia rose to her feet, “did you say something to her\\nyesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had\\nundertaken to get her one. Was that true?”\\n\\n“Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity! I merely hinted at\\nher obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had\\ndied in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your\\nlate parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the\\nservice at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be\\nvery ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in\\nthat case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,\\nhe-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!”\\n\\n“Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes\\neverything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like\\nthat... yes... You must excuse her,” said Sonia, and again she got up to\\ngo.\\n\\n“But you haven’t heard what I have to say.”\\n\\n“No, I haven’t heard,” muttered Sonia.\\n\\n“Then sit down.” She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third\\ntime.\\n\\n“Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,\\nas I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,\\nthat is, so far as is in my power, not more. One might for instance get\\nup a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as\\nis always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous\\nof assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might\\nbe done.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes... God will repay you for it,” faltered Sonia, gazing intently\\nat Pyotr Petrovitch.\\n\\n“It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, we\\nwill talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come\\nto me at seven o’clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But\\nthere is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and\\nfor which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. In\\nmy opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe to put it into Katerina\\nIvanovna’s own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she\\nhas not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots\\nor shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,\\nI believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.\\nTo-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won’t have a crust of\\nbread. It’s absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought\\nto be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but\\nonly you, for instance. Am I right?”\\n\\n“I don’t know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She was\\nso anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is very\\nsensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will\\nall be... and God will reward... and the orphans...”\\n\\nSonia burst into tears.\\n\\n“Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the\\nbenefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me\\npersonally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in\\nconnection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I\\ncannot do more...”\\n\\nAnd Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully\\nunfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something\\nand began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously\\nto the door. She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,\\nand returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.\\n\\nAll this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the\\nroom, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he\\nwalked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.\\n\\n“I heard and _saw_ everything,” he said, laying stress on the last verb.\\n“That is honourable, I mean to say, it’s humane! You wanted to avoid\\ngratitude, I saw! And although I cannot, I confess, in principle\\nsympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the\\nevil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with\\npleasure--yes, yes, I like it.”\\n\\n“That’s all nonsense,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted,\\nlooking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.\\n\\n“No, it’s not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as\\nyou did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,\\nsuch a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still\\ndeserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr\\nPetrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback\\nyour ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by your\\nill-luck yesterday,” cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt\\na return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. “And, what do you want with\\nmarriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do\\nyou cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you\\nlike, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are\\nfree, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, I’ve spoken\\nmy mind!”\\n\\n“Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and\\nto bring up another man’s children, that’s why I want legal marriage,”\\n Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.\\n\\nHe seemed preoccupied by something.\\n\\n“Children? You referred to children,” Lebeziatnikov started off like\\na warhorse at the trumpet call. “Children are a social question and a\\nquestion of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has\\nanother solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they\\nsuggest the institution of the family. We’ll speak of children later,\\nbut now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak point.\\nThat horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the\\ndictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It’s nonsense,\\nthere will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural\\nconsequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.\\nSo that indeed it’s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an\\nabsurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of\\nit. I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now\\nI respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You laugh! That’s\\nbecause you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound\\nit all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived\\nin a legal marriage, but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a\\ndespicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is\\nopen, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s unthinkable.\\nYour wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you\\nincapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for\\nher new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,\\npfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same,\\nI should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for\\nherself. ‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more than that I\\ndesire you to respect me. See!’ Am I not right?”\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.\\nHe hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else and\\neven Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited\\nand rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected\\nupon it afterwards.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nIt would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the\\nidea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna’s disordered brain.\\nNearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s\\nfuneral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to\\nhonour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers,\\nand still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their\\ninferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the\\nright “to turn up his nose at him.” Perhaps the chief element was that\\npeculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend\\ntheir last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order\\nto do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.” It is very\\nprobable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at\\nthe moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those\\n“wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how\\nto entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might\\nalmost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for\\nsweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night. Even the\\npoorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these\\nparoxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible\\nnervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she\\nmight have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have\\nbeen broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will\\ncould not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her\\nmind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year\\npast she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.\\nThe later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the\\nintellect.\\n\\nThere was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine\\nthere was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest\\nquality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and\\nhoney, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of\\npancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were\\nboiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina\\nIvanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help\\nof one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been\\nstranded at Madame Lippevechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina\\nIvanovna’s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before\\nrunning about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious\\nthat everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina\\nIvanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called\\nher “_Pani_.” She was heartily sick of him before the end, though\\nshe had declared at first that she could not have got on without this\\n“serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s\\ncharacteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.\\nHer praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she\\nwould invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance\\nand quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she\\nwould be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the\\nperson she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She\\nwas naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from\\ncontinual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_\\nthat all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the\\npeace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost\\nto frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and\\nfancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against\\nthe wall.\\n\\nAmalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary\\nrespect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart\\nand soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,\\nto provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her\\nkitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone\\nherself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the\\ntable-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses\\nwere, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,\\nbut the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,\\nfeeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and\\na cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some\\npride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for\\nsome reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by\\nAmalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. “Could she\\nbe stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,\\nand had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!\\nFancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father who had been a colonel and almost\\na governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then\\nanyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been\\nallowed into the kitchen.”\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the\\ntime and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided\\ninwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down\\nand set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was\\nfancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that\\nhardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except\\nthe Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the\\nmemorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned\\nup, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older\\nand more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.\\nPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most\\nrespectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna\\nhad the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,\\nPolenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,\\nnoble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had\\nbeen a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s\\nhouse, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her\\na considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna\\nexalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior\\nmotive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to\\nthe consequence of the person praised. Probably “taking his cue” from\\nLuzhin, “that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up\\neither. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness\\nand because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a\\nfriend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.”\\n\\nAmong those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her\\nold-maidish daughter,” who had only been lodgers in the house for the\\nlast fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar\\nin Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come\\nback drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,\\nquarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole\\nfamily out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the\\nfoot” of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing. Katerina\\nIvanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, “whose\\nfoot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she\\ncasually met them, so that they might know that “she was more noble in\\nher thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,” and might see\\nthat she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to\\nmake this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s\\ngovernorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly\\nstupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he\\nwas really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it\\nappeared that he had been “not himself” for the last two days. The party\\nconsisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and\\na greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt\\nabominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the\\npost office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone\\nat Amalia Ivanovna’s.\\n\\nA retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was\\ndrunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without\\na waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without\\neven greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit\\nappeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of\\nAmalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought\\nwith him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s\\nand whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina\\nIvanovna intensely. “For whom had they made all these preparations\\nthen?” To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid\\nfor at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the\\nfurthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big\\ngirl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like\\nwell-bred children’s.\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with\\nincreased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with\\nspecial severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing\\nto the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who\\nwere absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the\\nlatter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omen\\nfor the end. All were seated at last.\\n\\nRaskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the\\ncemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the\\nfirst place, because he was the one “educated visitor, and, as everyone\\nknew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,” and\\nsecondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having\\nbeen unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and\\nmade him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In\\nspite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round\\ncorrectly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising\\ncough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse\\nduring the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to\\nRaskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at\\nthe failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and\\nuncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of\\nher landlady.\\n\\n“It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know whom I mean? Her, her!” Katerina\\nIvanovna nodded towards the landlady. “Look at her, she’s making round\\neyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can’t understand.\\nPfoo, the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that\\ncap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyone\\nto consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being\\nhere? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially\\nthose who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has\\nbrought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And those\\nwretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has ever\\npoked his nose in here, I’ve never set eyes on them. What have they come\\nhere for, I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey, _pan_!” she cried\\nsuddenly to one of them, “have you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!\\nHave some beer! Won’t you have some vodka? Look, he’s jumped up and is\\nmaking his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things. Never mind,\\nlet them eat! They don’t make a noise, anyway, though I’m really afraid\\nfor our landlady’s silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!” she addressed her\\nsuddenly, almost aloud, “if your spoons should happen to be stolen,\\nI won’t be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!” She laughed turning to\\nRaskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her\\nsally. “She didn’t understand, she didn’t understand again! Look how\\nshe sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons,\\nha-ha-ha!”\\n\\nHere her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that\\nlasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead\\nand her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov\\nthe blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began\\nwhispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her\\ncheeks.\\n\\n“Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,\\nfor inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am\\nspeaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she\\nhas managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that\\nprovincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and\\nhas come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the\\ngovernment offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody\\nknows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has\\nnot even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners\\nrequired! I can’t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But\\nwhere’s Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it,\\nSonia, where have you been? It’s odd that even at your father’s funeral\\nyou should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her\\nbeside you. That’s your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of\\nthe cold entrée with jelly, that’s the best. They’ll bring the pancakes\\ndirectly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got\\neverything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That’s all right. Be a good girl, Lida,\\nand, Kolya, don’t fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.\\nWhat are you saying, Sonia?”\\n\\nSonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch’s apologies, trying to\\nspeak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most\\nrespectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added\\nthat Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as\\nhe possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone\\nwith her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc.\\n\\nSonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her\\nand gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a\\nhurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time\\nshe seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed\\nabsent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying\\nto please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get\\nmourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her\\nonly dress, a dark striped cotton one.\\n\\nThe message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to\\nSonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how\\nPyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to\\nRaskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of\\nPyotr Petrovitch’s position and standing to find himself in such\\n“extraordinary company,” in spite of his devotion to her family and his\\nold friendship with her father.\\n\\n“That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have\\nnot disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings,” she added\\nalmost aloud. “But I am sure that it was only your special affection for\\nmy poor husband that has made you keep your promise.”\\n\\nThen once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and\\nsuddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: “Wouldn’t he\\nhave some more meat, and had he been given some wine?” The old man made\\nno answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,\\nthough his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He\\nsimply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the\\ngeneral mirth.\\n\\n“What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr\\nPetrovitch, I always had confidence in him,” Katerina Ivanovna\\ncontinued, “and, of course, he is not like...” with an extremely stern\\nface she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter\\nwas quite disconcerted, “not like your dressed up draggletails whom\\nmy father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late\\nhusband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the\\ngoodness of his heart.”\\n\\n“Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!” cried the\\ncommissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.\\n\\n“My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows\\nit,” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and\\nhonourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was\\nhis good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he\\ndrank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you\\nbelieve it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his\\npocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!”\\n\\n“A cock? Did you say a cock?” shouted the commissariat clerk.\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost in\\nthought.\\n\\n“No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him,” she\\nwent on, addressing Raskolnikov. “But that’s not so! He respected me, he\\nrespected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was\\nfor him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to\\nfeel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would\\nthink to myself: ‘Be kind to him and he will drink again,’ it was only\\nby severity that you could keep him within bounds.”\\n\\n“Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,” roared the\\ncommissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.\\n\\n“Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having\\ntheir hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!” Katerina\\nIvanovna snapped at him.\\n\\nThe flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. In\\nanother minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the\\nvisitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the\\ncommissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently\\ntrying to egg him on.\\n\\n“Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,” began the clerk, “that is\\nto say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I don’t care!\\nThat’s nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!”\\n\\nAnd he took another drink of vodka.\\n\\nRaskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only ate from\\npoliteness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually\\nputting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia\\nintently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,\\ntoo, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with\\nterror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,\\nwas the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ contemptuous treatment of\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that\\nthe mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the\\nquestion: “How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young\\nperson_?” Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard\\nthis and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an\\ninsult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that\\nKaterina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, “till she had shown those\\ndraggletails that they were both...” To make matters worse someone\\npassed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts\\npierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed\\ncrimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it\\nwas “a drunken ass!”\\n\\nAmalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time\\ndeeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s haughtiness, and to restore the\\ngood-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,\\napropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “Karl\\nfrom the chemist’s,” who was driving one night in a cab, and that “the\\ncabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,\\nand wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his\\nheart.” Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that\\nAmalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was\\nstill more offended, and she retorted that her “_Vater aus Berlin_ was a\\nvery important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.” Katerina\\nIvanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia\\nIvanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.\\n\\n“Listen to the owl!” Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her\\ngood-humour almost restored, “she meant to say he kept his hands in\\nhis pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets.\\n(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these\\nPetersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than\\nwe! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’\\n‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of punishing\\nthe cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.’ Ah, the fool!\\nAnd you know she fancies it’s very touching and does not suspect how\\nstupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great\\ndeal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with\\ndrink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved\\nand serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry, ha-ha!\\n(Cough-cough-cough.)”\\n\\nRegaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling\\nRaskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open\\na school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.\\nThis was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she\\nlaunched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that\\nKaterina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of\\nwhich Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told\\nhim that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance\\nbefore the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This\\ncertificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina\\nIvanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself\\nwith it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up\\ndraggletails” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably\\nthat Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say\\naristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to\\ncertain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.” The\\ncertificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken\\nguests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually\\ncontained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the\\nrank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really\\nwas almost the daughter of a colonel.\\n\\nWarming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and\\nhappy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom\\nshe would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most\\nrespectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna\\nherself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt\\nteach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would\\ngo with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at\\nthe further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.\\n\\nThough Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of\\nit, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of\\nSonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience,\\ndevotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and\\nkissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna\\nsuddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous\\nand silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and\\nas the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”\\n\\nAt that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in\\nthe conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,\\nand with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty\\nobservation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay\\nparticular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a\\ngood _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies\\nmust not novels at night read.”\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as\\nheartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying\\n“she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the\\nbusiness of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class\\nboarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,\\nthat was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia\\nIvanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “meant her\\ngood,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long\\nsince she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.”\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna at once “set her down,” saying that it was a lie to\\nsay she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband\\nwas lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this\\nAmalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those\\nladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_\\nladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.” Katerina Ivanovna\\nat once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge\\nwhat made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her\\n“_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in\\npockets went, and always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’” and she leapt\\nup from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her\\npockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling “poof!\\npoof!” amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged\\nAmalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.\\n\\nBut this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,\\nso that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a\\nfather, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once\\nbeen a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red\\nas a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a\\nfather, “but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat\\nand always said poof-poof-poof!”\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family\\nwas and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print\\nthat her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father--if she\\nreally had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she\\nnever had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name\\nwas Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.\\n\\nAt this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,\\nand shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, “that\\nher _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister.” Katerina\\nIvanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice\\n(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that “if she\\ndared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a\\nlevel with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her\\nhead and trample it under foot.” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,\\nshouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and\\nthat Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she\\nrushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.\\nThere was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia\\nran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted\\nsomething about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia\\naway, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.\\n\\nAt that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared\\non the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant\\neyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” she cried, “protect me... you at least! Make this\\nfoolish woman understand that she can’t behave like this to a lady in\\nmisfortune... that there is a law for such things.... I’ll go to the\\ngovernor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering my\\nfather’s hospitality protect these orphans.”\\n\\n“Allow me, madam.... Allow me.” Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. “Your\\npapa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing” (someone\\nlaughed aloud) “and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting\\nsquabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own\\naffairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...\\nIvanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass.”\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia\\nwas.\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though\\nthunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny\\nhaving enjoyed her father’s hospitality. Though she had invented it\\nherself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too\\nby the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr\\nPetrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not\\nonly was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with the\\nrest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some\\nmatter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him\\nand that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing\\nbeside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not\\nseem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the\\ndoorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked\\ninterest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.\\n\\n“Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter of\\nsome importance,” Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company\\ngenerally. “I am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia\\nIvanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful\\nattention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,”\\n he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already\\nalarmed, “immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble\\nnote was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.\\nLebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where\\nit is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to\\nwitness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be\\ncompelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must\\nblame yourself.”\\n\\nComplete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were\\nstill. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a\\nword. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.\\n\\n“Well, how is it to be then?” asked Luzhin, looking intently at her.\\n\\n“I don’t know.... I know nothing about it,” Sonia articulated faintly at\\nlast.\\n\\n“No, you know nothing?” Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some\\nseconds. “Think a moment, mademoiselle,” he began severely, but still,\\nas it were, admonishing her. “Reflect, I am prepared to give you time\\nfor consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely\\nconvinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to\\naccuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before\\nwitnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense\\nbe made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for\\nmy own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of\\napproximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my\\npocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.\\nLebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three\\nhundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.\\nAbout five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three\\nnotes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my\\ninvitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly\\nembarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the\\nconversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness\\nto this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm\\nmy statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in\\norder to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your\\nrelative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),\\nand the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a\\nsubscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me and\\neven shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to\\nrecall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest\\ndetail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from\\nthe table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part\\nfor the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then\\nI accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of\\nembarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I\\ntalked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I\\nreturned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count\\nit and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one\\nhundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.\\nMr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such\\na supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the\\nminute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the\\ntotal correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your\\neagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some\\ntime on the table, and taking into consideration your social position\\nand the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and\\npositively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a\\ncruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in\\nspite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in\\nmaking this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have\\ntaken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing\\nto your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your\\ndestitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and\\nyou, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too\\nbad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg\\nyou--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you\\nare doing, otherwise I shall be immovable! Well, what do you say?”\\n\\n“I have taken nothing,” Sonia whispered in terror, “you gave me ten\\nroubles, here it is, take it.”\\n\\nSonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,\\ntook out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.\\n\\n“And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?” he insisted\\nreproachfully, not taking the note.\\n\\nSonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,\\nironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against\\nthe wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.\\n\\n“Good God!” broke from Sonia.\\n\\n“Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore\\nI humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter,” Luzhin said\\nsoftly and even kindly.\\n\\n“_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief,” cried Amalia\\nIvanovna, throwing up her hands.\\n\\n“You knew it?” Luzhin caught her up, “then I suppose you had some reason\\nbefore this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to\\nremember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.”\\n\\nThere was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in\\nmovement.\\n\\n“What!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and\\nshe rushed at Luzhin. “What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the\\nwretches, the wretches!”\\n\\nAnd running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as\\nin a vise.\\n\\n“Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it\\nto me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!”\\n\\nAnd snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and\\nflung it straight into Luzhin’s face. It hit him in the eye and fell\\non the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch\\nlost his temper.\\n\\n“Hold that mad woman!” he shouted.\\n\\nAt that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in\\nthe doorway, among them the two ladies.\\n\\n“What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!” shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. “You are an\\nidiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his\\nmoney! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d give away her last penny!” and Katerina\\nIvanovna broke into hysterical laughter. “Did you ever see such an\\nidiot?” she turned from side to side. “And you too?” she suddenly saw\\nthe landlady, “and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a\\nthief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crinoline! She hasn’t been\\nout of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down\\nbeside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search\\nher! Since she’s not left the room, the money would have to be on her!\\nSearch her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then excuse me, my\\ndear fellow, you’ll answer for it! I’ll go to our Sovereign, to our\\nSovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,\\nto-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do\\nyou think they wouldn’t? You’re wrong, I will get in! I will get in!\\nYou reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so\\nsubmissive, let me tell you! You’ve gone too far yourself. Search her,\\nsearch her!”\\n\\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards\\nSonia.\\n\\n“I am ready, I’ll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm\\nyourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as to\\nthat...” Luzhin muttered, “that ought to be before the police... though\\nindeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in\\nany case it’s difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with\\nthe help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it’s not the way to do\\nthings.... How is it to be done?”\\n\\n“As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\n“Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,\\nhere was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! D’you see,\\nd’you see?”\\n\\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside\\nout. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing\\na parabola in the air fell at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several\\ncried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two\\nfingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a\\nhundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note\\nshowing it to everyone.\\n\\n“Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!” yelled Amalia Ivanovna.\\n“They must to Siberia be sent! Away!”\\n\\nExclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his\\neyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.\\nSonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel\\nsurprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry\\nand hid her face in her hands.\\n\\n“No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,” she cried\\nwith a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped\\nher tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the\\nworld.\\n\\n“Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!” she\\ncried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her\\narms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her\\nhands and kissing them, too, “you took it! How stupid these people are!\\nOh dear! You are fools, fools,” she cried, addressing the whole room,\\n“you don’t know, you don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she\\nis! She take it, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help\\nyou if you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow passport\\nbecause my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,\\nhusband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!\\nMerciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion\\nRomanovitch, why don’t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You\\nare not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend\\nher now, at least!”\\n\\nThe wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a\\ngreat effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,\\nthe parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained\\nas a child’s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help\\nwere so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch\\nat any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.\\n\\n“Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!” he cried\\nimpressively, “no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an\\ninstigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved\\nher guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous\\nidea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,\\nso to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to\\nconfess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?\\nYou lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how\\ncould you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,” he\\naddressed the whole company, “gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,\\ncommiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite\\nof the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a\\nlesson to you for the future,” he said, addressing Sonia, “and I will\\ncarry the matter no further. Enough!”\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the\\nfire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile\\nKaterina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging\\nSonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on\\nall sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was\\nwrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty\\nlittle face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia’s shoulder.\\n\\n“How vile!” a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.\\n\\n“What vileness!” Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the\\nface.\\n\\nPyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it\\nafterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.\\n\\n“And you dared to call me as witness?” he said, going up to Pyotr\\nPetrovitch.\\n\\n“What do you mean? What are you talking about?” muttered Luzhin.\\n\\n“I mean that you... are a slanderer, that’s what my words mean!”\\n Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted\\neyes.\\n\\nHe was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though\\nseizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr\\nPetrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.\\n\\n“If you mean that for me,...” he began, stammering. “But what’s the\\nmatter with you? Are you out of your mind?”\\n\\n“I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard\\neverything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own\\neven now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I\\ncan’t understand.”\\n\\n“Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical\\nriddles! Or maybe you are drunk!”\\n\\n“You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch\\nvodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, he\\nhimself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble\\nnote--I saw it, I was a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!”\\n repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.\\n\\n“Are you crazy, milksop?” squealed Luzhin. “She is herself before\\nyou--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her\\nonly ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?”\\n\\n“I saw it, I saw it,” Lebeziatnikov repeated, “and though it is against\\nmy principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like\\nbefore the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only\\nlike a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying\\ngood-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with\\nthe other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I\\nsaw it!”\\n\\nLuzhin turned pale.\\n\\n“What lies!” he cried impudently, “why, how could you, standing by the\\nwindow, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You\\nare raving!”\\n\\n“No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw\\nit all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from\\nthe window--that’s true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble\\nnote, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,\\nyou took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I\\nwas standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not\\nforget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand\\nall the time. I didn’t think of it again until, when you were getting\\nup, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped\\nit! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant\\nto do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you\\nand I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I\\nsaw it, I’ll take my oath.”\\n\\nLebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands\\nchiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They all\\ncrowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.\\n\\n“I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her\\npart! She is an orphan. God has sent you!”\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees\\nbefore him.\\n\\n“A pack of nonsense!” yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, “it’s all nonsense\\nyou’ve been talking! ‘An idea struck you, you didn’t think, you\\nnoticed’--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on\\npurpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?”\\n\\n“What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what I am telling\\nyou is the fact, that’s certain! So far from my being mistaken, you\\ninfamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question\\noccurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing\\nyour hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it\\nsecretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that\\nmy convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private\\nbenevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you\\nreally were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,\\ntoo, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole\\nhundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people\\nare very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then\\nthe idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,\\nwhen she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you\\nwanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand\\nshould not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so\\nmany possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it\\nindelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck\\nme again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she\\nnoticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of\\nthe room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.\\nBut on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the\\n‘General Treatise on the Positive Method’ and especially to recommend\\nPiderit’s article (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what a\\nstate of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and\\nreflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her\\npocket?”\\n\\nWhen Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical\\ndeduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed\\nfrom his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly\\nin Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite\\nexhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech\\nproduced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with such\\nconviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt\\nthat things were going badly with him.\\n\\n“What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?” he shouted,\\n“that’s no evidence. You may have dreamt it, that’s all! And I tell you,\\nyou are lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite against\\nme, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,\\ngodless, social propositions!”\\n\\nBut this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval\\nwere heard on all sides.\\n\\n“Ah, that’s your line now, is it!” cried Lebeziatnikov, “that’s\\nnonsense! Call the police and I’ll take my oath! There’s only one thing\\nI can’t understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh,\\npitiful, despicable man!”\\n\\n“I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,\\nwill swear to it,” Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he\\nstepped forward.\\n\\nHe appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from the\\nvery look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would\\nbe solved.\\n\\n“Now I can explain it all to myself,” said Raskolnikov, addressing\\nLebeziatnikov. “From the very beginning of the business, I suspected\\nthat there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began\\nto suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which\\nI will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your\\nvaluable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,\\nall to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently\\nengaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna\\nRaskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day\\nbefore yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I\\nhave two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day\\nbefore yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,\\nand that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before\\nyesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,\\nas a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to\\nmy mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not\\nto Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most\\ncontemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,\\nhinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you\\nunderstand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,\\nby insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money\\nwhich they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,\\nbefore my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had\\ngiven the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya\\nSemyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had\\nnever seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,\\nPyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya\\nSemyonovna’s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his\\nquestion--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I\\nanswered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother\\nand sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he\\ngradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took\\nplace and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday\\nevening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now\\nsucceeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would\\nhave shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his\\nsuspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on\\na level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting\\nand preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might\\neven, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,\\nand no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing\\nof revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing\\nthat the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to\\nme. That was what he was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s\\nthe whole reason for it and there can be no other!”\\n\\nIt was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his\\nspeech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by\\nexclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke\\nclearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of\\nconviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be\\nit, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,\\nwhether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s\\nguests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was\\nessential for him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!”\\n\\nLuzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He\\nseemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have\\nbeen glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this\\nwas scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of\\nthe accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had\\nalready been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The\\ncommissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,\\nwas shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very\\nunpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came\\nin from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited\\nand were continually shouting at him: “The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” and\\nmuttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained\\nattention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as\\nthough she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her\\neyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina\\nIvanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.\\nAmalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth\\nwide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr\\nPetrovitch had somehow come to grief.\\n\\nRaskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.\\nEveryone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.\\nBut Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of\\nSonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:\\n\\n“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don’t squeeze, let me pass!” he said,\\nmaking his way through the crowd. “And no threats, if you please! I\\nassure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the\\ncontrary, you’ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing\\nthe course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I\\nshall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and\\nwill not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and\\natheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are\\nfoolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!”\\n\\n“Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and\\neverything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I’ve\\nbeen taking, the way I’ve been expounding... all this fortnight!”\\n\\n“I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;\\nnow I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor\\nfor your brains and your short sight. Let me pass, gentlemen!”\\n\\nHe forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to\\nlet him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished\\nit in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew\\nstraight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,\\nfell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room\\nand half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had\\nfelt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than\\nanyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that\\nmoment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,\\ngentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was\\ntoo great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without\\nmurmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too\\nbitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first\\nterror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all\\nclearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her\\nmade her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical\\nweeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room\\nand ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin’s departure. When amidst\\nloud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the\\nlandlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina\\nIvanovna, considering her to blame for everything.\\n\\n“Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!”\\n\\nAnd with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay\\nher hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the\\nfloor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,\\njumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at\\nAmalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her\\naway like a feather.\\n\\n“What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature\\nattacks me! What! On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of\\nmy lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,\\nwith my orphans! Where am I to go?” wailed the poor woman, sobbing and\\ngasping. “Good God!” she cried with flashing eyes, “is there no justice\\nupon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!\\nThere is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,\\ngodless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back. Wait\\nfor me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is\\njustice on earth!”\\n\\nAnd throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had\\nmentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the\\ndisorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,\\nwailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention\\nof going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little\\nones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the\\nroom, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia\\nIvanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing\\neverything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked\\nincoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had\\nhappened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others\\nstruck up a song....\\n\\n“Now it’s time for me to go,” thought Raskolnikov. “Well, Sofya\\nSemyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!”\\n\\nAnd he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nRaskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against\\nLuzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own\\nheart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort\\nof relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal\\nfeeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,\\nespecially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview\\nwith Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the\\nterrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the\\nthought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, “Well,\\nSofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!” he was still\\nsuperficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over\\nLuzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia’s lodging, he\\nfelt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the\\ndoor, asking himself the strange question: “Must he tell her who killed\\nLizaveta?” It was a strange question because he felt at the very time\\nnot only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could\\nnot put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he\\nonly _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before\\nthe inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and\\nsuffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the\\ndoorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in\\nher hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet\\nhim as though she were expecting him.\\n\\n“What would have become of me but for you?” she said quickly, meeting\\nhim in the middle of the room.\\n\\nEvidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been\\nwaiting for.\\n\\nRaskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she\\nhad only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she\\nhad done the day before.\\n\\n“Well, Sonia?” he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, “it was\\nall due to ‘your social position and the habits associated with it.’ Did\\nyou understand that just now?”\\n\\nHer face showed her distress.\\n\\n“Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him.\\n“Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough without that.”\\n\\nShe made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.\\n\\n“I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I\\nwanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”\\n\\nHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging\\nand that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”\\n\\n“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”\\n\\nAnd she snatched up her cape.\\n\\n“It’s everlastingly the same thing!” said Raskolnikov, irritably.\\n“You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with me.”\\n\\n“But... Katerina Ivanovna?”\\n\\n“You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you\\nherself since she has run out,” he added peevishly. “If she doesn’t find\\nyou here, you’ll be blamed for it....”\\n\\nSonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at\\nthe floor and deliberating.\\n\\n“This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking\\nat Sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would\\nhave sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.\\nAh?”\\n\\n“Yes,” she assented in a faint voice. “Yes,” she repeated, preoccupied\\nand distressed.\\n\\n“But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident\\nLebeziatnikov’s turning up.”\\n\\nSonia was silent.\\n\\n“And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said\\nyesterday?”\\n\\nAgain she did not answer. He waited.\\n\\n“I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, leave off.’”\\n Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. “What, silence\\nagain?” he asked a minute later. “We must talk about something, you\\nknow. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a\\ncertain ‘problem’ as Lebeziatnikov would say.” (He was beginning to lose\\nthe thread.) “No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had\\nknown all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,\\nthat they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and\\nyourself thrown in--since you don’t count yourself for anything--Polenka\\ntoo... for she’ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on\\nyour decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether\\nLuzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna\\nshould die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?”\\n\\nSonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this\\nhesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout\\nway.\\n\\n“I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,” she said,\\nlooking inquisitively at him.\\n\\n“I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?”\\n\\n“Why do you ask about what could not happen?” said Sonia reluctantly.\\n\\n“Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked\\nthings? You haven’t dared to decide even that!”\\n\\n“But I can’t know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what\\ncan’t be answered? What’s the use of such foolish questions? How could\\nit happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge\\nto decide who is to live and who is not to live?”\\n\\n“Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing\\nanything,” Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.\\n\\n“You’d better say straight out what you want!” Sonia cried in distress.\\n“You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to\\ntorture me?”\\n\\nShe could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at\\nher in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.\\n\\n“Of course you’re right, Sonia,” he said softly at last. He was suddenly\\nchanged. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.\\nEven his voice was suddenly weak. “I told you yesterday that I was not\\ncoming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask\\nforgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.\\nI was asking forgiveness, Sonia....”\\n\\nHe tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in\\nhis pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.\\n\\nAnd suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred\\nfor Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened\\nof this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he\\nmet her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was\\nlove in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real\\nfeeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that\\n_that_ minute had come.\\n\\nHe hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he\\nturned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without\\nuttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.\\n\\nHis sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had\\nstood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that “he must\\nnot lose another minute.”\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.\\n\\nHe could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he\\nhad intended to “tell” and he did not understand what was happening to\\nhim now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and\\nwaited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It\\nwas unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,\\nhelplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed\\nthrough Sonia’s heart.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” she repeated, drawing a little away from him.\\n\\n“Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened.... It’s nonsense. It really is\\nnonsense, if you think of it,” he muttered, like a man in delirium. “Why\\nhave I come to torture you?” he added suddenly, looking at her. “Why,\\nreally? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia....”\\n\\nHe had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour\\nbefore, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and\\nfeeling a continual tremor all over.\\n\\n“Oh, how you are suffering!” she muttered in distress, looking intently\\nat him.\\n\\n“It’s all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia.” He suddenly smiled, a pale\\nhelpless smile for two seconds. “You remember what I meant to tell you\\nyesterday?”\\n\\nSonia waited uneasily.\\n\\n“I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but\\nthat if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.”\\n\\nShe began trembling all over.\\n\\n“Well, here I’ve come to tell you.”\\n\\n“Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered with difficulty.\\n“How do you know?” she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her\\nreason.\\n\\nSonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\nShe paused a minute.\\n\\n“Have they found him?” she asked timidly.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Then how do you know about _it_?” she asked again, hardly audibly and\\nagain after a minute’s pause.\\n\\nHe turned to her and looked very intently at her.\\n\\n“Guess,” he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.\\n\\nA shudder passed over her.\\n\\n“But you... why do you frighten me like this?” she said, smiling like a\\nchild.\\n\\n“I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know,” Raskolnikov went\\non, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes\\naway. “He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her\\naccidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and\\nhe went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.”\\n\\nAnother awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.\\n\\n“You can’t guess, then?” he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were\\nflinging himself down from a steeple.\\n\\n“N-no...” whispered Sonia.\\n\\n“Take a good look.”\\n\\nAs soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his\\nheart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the\\nface of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s\\nface, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the\\nwall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking\\nas little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,\\nlooking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and\\nholding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same\\nthing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same\\nterror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left\\nhand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to\\nget up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed\\neven more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear\\nshowed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost\\nwith the same _childish_ smile.\\n\\n“Have you guessed?” he whispered at last.\\n\\n“Good God!” broke in an awful wail from her bosom.\\n\\nShe sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a\\nmoment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands\\nand, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his\\nface again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she\\ntried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;\\nthere was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when\\nshe recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she\\nhad seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for\\ninstance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as\\nsoon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen\\nthis very thing.\\n\\n“Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,” he begged her miserably.\\n\\nIt was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,\\nbut this is how it happened.\\n\\nShe jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her\\nhands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat\\ndown again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden\\nshe started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on\\nher knees before him, she did not know why.\\n\\n“What have you done--what have you done to yourself?” she said in\\ndespair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms\\nround him, and held him tightly.\\n\\nRaskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.\\n\\n“You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you\\nabout that.... You don’t think what you are doing.”\\n\\n“There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!” she\\ncried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into\\nviolent hysterical weeping.\\n\\nA feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at\\nonce. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes\\nand hung on his eyelashes.\\n\\n“Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?” he said, looking at her almost with\\nhope.\\n\\n“No, no, never, nowhere!” cried Sonia. “I will follow you, I will follow\\nyou everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn’t I\\nknow you before! Why didn’t you come before? Oh, dear!”\\n\\n“Here I have come.”\\n\\n“Yes, now! What’s to be done now?... Together, together!” she repeated\\nas it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. “I’ll follow you to\\nSiberia!”\\n\\nHe recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to\\nhis lips.\\n\\n“Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,” he said.\\n\\nSonia looked at him quickly.\\n\\nAgain after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man\\nthe terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she\\nseemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She\\nknew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all\\nthese questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not\\nbelieve it: “He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?”\\n\\n“What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?” she said in complete\\nbewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. “How could you,\\nyou, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does\\nit mean?”\\n\\n“Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,” he answered wearily, almost\\nwith vexation.\\n\\nSonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:\\n\\n“You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?”\\n\\n“No, Sonia, no,” he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. “I was\\nnot so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that’s\\nnot the real thing either.... Don’t torture me, Sonia.”\\n\\nSonia clasped her hands.\\n\\n“Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could\\nbelieve it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet\\nrob and murder! Ah,” she cried suddenly, “that money you gave Katerina\\nIvanovna... that money.... Can that money...”\\n\\n“No, Sonia,” he broke in hurriedly, “that money was not it. Don’t worry\\nyourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the\\nday I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....\\nThat money was mine--my own.”\\n\\nSonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.\\n\\n“And _that_ money.... I don’t even know really whether there was any\\nmoney,” he added softly, as though reflecting. “I took a purse off her\\nneck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...\\nbut I didn’t look in it; I suppose I hadn’t time.... And the\\nthings--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next\\nmorning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now....”\\n\\nSonia strained every nerve to listen.\\n\\n“Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?” she\\nasked quickly, catching at a straw.\\n\\n“I don’t know.... I haven’t yet decided whether to take that money or\\nnot,” he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he\\ngave a brief ironical smile. “Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?”\\n\\nThe thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he mad? But she\\ndismissed it at once. “No, it was something else.” She could make\\nnothing of it, nothing.\\n\\n“Do you know, Sonia,” he said suddenly with conviction, “let me tell\\nyou: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,” laying stress on\\nevery word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, “I should\\nbe _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you,” he\\ncried a moment later with a sort of despair, “what would it matter to\\nyou if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such\\na stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to you\\nto-day?”\\n\\nAgain Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.\\n\\n“I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.”\\n\\n“Go where?” asked Sonia timidly.\\n\\n“Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,” he smiled bitterly.\\n“We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it’s only now, only this\\nmoment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!\\nYesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one\\nthing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won’t leave me,\\nSonia?”\\n\\nShe squeezed his hand.\\n\\n“And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?” he cried a minute\\nlater in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. “Here you expect\\nan explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see\\nthat. But what can I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer\\nmisery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.\\nWhy do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my burden and have come to\\nthrow it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can\\nyou love such a mean wretch?”\\n\\n“But aren’t you suffering, too?” cried Sonia.\\n\\nAgain a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an\\ninstant softened it.\\n\\n“Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great\\ndeal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn’t have\\ncome. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That’s\\nnot the point. I must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.”\\n\\nHe paused and sank into thought.\\n\\n“Ach, we are so different,” he cried again, “we are not alike. And why,\\nwhy did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.”\\n\\n“No, no, it was a good thing you came,” cried Sonia. “It’s better I\\nshould know, far better!”\\n\\nHe looked at her with anguish.\\n\\n“What if it were really that?” he said, as though reaching a conclusion.\\n“Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I\\nkilled her.... Do you understand now?”\\n\\n“N-no,” Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. “Only speak, speak, I shall\\nunderstand, I shall understand _in myself_!” she kept begging him.\\n\\n“You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!” He paused and was for some\\ntime lost in meditation.\\n\\n“It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if\\nNapoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had\\nnot had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his\\ncareer with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,\\nthere had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had\\nto be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you\\nunderstand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had\\nbeen no other means? Wouldn’t he have felt a pang at its being so far\\nfrom monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I\\nworried myself fearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully\\nashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would\\nnot have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck\\nhim that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there\\nwas anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,\\nhe would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!\\nWell, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following\\nhis example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,\\nSonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that’s just how it\\nwas.”\\n\\nSonia did not think it at all funny.\\n\\n“You had better tell me straight out... without examples,” she begged,\\nstill more timidly and scarcely audibly.\\n\\nHe turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.\\n\\n“You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense, it’s almost\\nall talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely\\nanything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned\\nto drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a\\nstudent, but I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced\\nfor a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten\\nor twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or\\nclerk with a salary of a thousand roubles” (he repeated it as though it\\nwere a lesson) “and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief\\nand anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my\\nsister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it’s a hard\\nthing to pass everything by all one’s life, to turn one’s back upon\\neverything, to forget one’s mother and decorously accept the insults\\ninflicted on one’s sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to\\nburden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again\\nwithout a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman’s\\nmoney and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,\\nto keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving\\nit--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up\\na completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....\\nWell... that’s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did\\nwrong.... Well, that’s enough.”\\n\\nHe struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head\\nsink.\\n\\n“Oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,” Sonia cried in distress. “How could\\none... no, that’s not right, not right.”\\n\\n“You see yourself that it’s not right. But I’ve spoken truly, it’s the\\ntruth.”\\n\\n“As though that could be the truth! Good God!”\\n\\n“I’ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful\\ncreature.”\\n\\n“A human being--a louse!”\\n\\n“I too know it wasn’t a louse,” he answered, looking strangely at\\nher. “But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,” he added. “I’ve been talking\\nnonsense a long time.... That’s not it, you are right there. There were\\nquite, quite other causes for it! I haven’t talked to anyone for so\\nlong, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.”\\n\\nHis eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an\\nuneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen\\nthrough his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She too\\nwas growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow\\ncomprehensible, but yet... “But how, how! Good God!” And she wrung her\\nhands in despair.\\n\\n“No, Sonia, that’s not it,” he began again suddenly, raising his head,\\nas though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were\\nroused him--“that’s not it! Better... imagine--yes, it’s certainly\\nbetter--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive\\nand... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let’s have it all out\\nat once! They’ve talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you just\\nnow I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that\\nperhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed\\nfor the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,\\nno doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I\\nturned sulky and wouldn’t. (Yes, sulkiness, that’s the right word for\\nit!) I sat in my room like a spider. You’ve been in my den, you’ve seen\\nit.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp\\nthe soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn’t\\ngo out of it! I wouldn’t on purpose! I didn’t go out for days together,\\nand I wouldn’t work, I wouldn’t even eat, I just lay there doing\\nnothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn’t, I\\nwent all day without; I wouldn’t ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At\\nnight I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn’t earn money for\\ncandles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies\\nan inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and\\nthinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange\\ndreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy\\nthat... No, that’s not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept\\nasking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I\\nknow they are--yet I won’t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one\\nwaits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I\\nunderstood that that would never come to pass, that men won’t change and\\nthat nobody can alter it and that it’s not worth wasting effort over it.\\nYes, that’s so. That’s the law of their nature, Sonia,... that’s so!...\\nAnd I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will\\nhave power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their\\neyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he\\nwho dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now\\nand so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!”\\n\\nThough Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared\\nwhether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he\\nwas in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without\\ntalking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his\\nfaith and code.\\n\\n“I divined then, Sonia,” he went on eagerly, “that power is only\\nvouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only\\none thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first\\ntime in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever\\nthought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is\\nthat not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to\\ngo straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted\\n_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the\\ndaring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!”\\n\\n“Oh hush, hush,” cried Sonia, clasping her hands. “You turned away from\\nGod and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!”\\n\\n“Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became\\nclear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?”\\n\\n“Hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer! You don’t understand, you don’t\\nunderstand! Oh God! He won’t understand!”\\n\\n“Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil\\nleading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!” he repeated with gloomy insistence. “I\\nknow it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all\\nover to myself, lying there in the dark.... I’ve argued it all over with\\nmyself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how\\nsick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it\\nand make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don’t\\nsuppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a\\nwise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn’t suppose that\\nI didn’t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether\\nI had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn’t the right--or that if\\nI asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn’t\\nso for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his\\ngoal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,\\nwondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly\\nof course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that\\nbattle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder\\nwithout casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn’t\\nwant to lie about it even to myself. It wasn’t to help my mother I did\\nthe murder--that’s nonsense--I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and\\npower and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;\\nI did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a\\nbenefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in\\nmy web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that\\nmoment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It\\nwas not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all\\nnow.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder\\nagain. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led\\nme on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse\\nlike everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or\\nnot, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling\\ncreature or whether I have the _right_...”\\n\\n“To kill? Have the right to kill?” Sonia clasped her hands.\\n\\n“Ach, Sonia!” he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort,\\nbut was contemptuously silent. “Don’t interrupt me, Sonia. I want to\\nprove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me\\nsince that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such\\na louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here I’ve come to you\\nnow! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to\\nyou? Listen: when I went then to the old woman’s I only went to\\n_try_.... You may be sure of that!”\\n\\n“And you murdered her!”\\n\\n“But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to\\ncommit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!\\nDid I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself\\nonce for all, for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that old\\nwoman, not I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!” he cried in a\\nsudden spasm of agony, “let me be!”\\n\\nHe leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as\\nin a vise.\\n\\n“What suffering!” A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.\\n\\n“Well, what am I to do now?” he asked, suddenly raising his head and\\nlooking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.\\n\\n“What are you to do?” she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been\\nfull of tears suddenly began to shine. “Stand up!” (She seized him by\\nthe shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.) “Go at once,\\nthis very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the\\nearth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say\\nto all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!’ Then God will send you life again.\\nWill you go, will you go?” she asked him, trembling all over, snatching\\nhis two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes\\nfull of fire.\\n\\nHe was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.\\n\\n“You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?” he asked gloomily.\\n\\n“Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must do.”\\n\\n“No! I am not going to them, Sonia!”\\n\\n“But how will you go on living? What will you live for?” cried Sonia,\\n“how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk to your mother? (Oh, what\\nwill become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned your\\nmother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh,\\nGod!” she cried, “why, he knows it all himself. How, how can he live by\\nhimself! What will become of you now?”\\n\\n“Don’t be a child, Sonia,” he said softly. “What wrong have I done\\nthem? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That’s only a\\nphantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a\\nvirtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them.\\nAnd what should I say to them--that I murdered her, but did not dare to\\ntake the money and hid it under a stone?” he added with a bitter smile.\\n“Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting\\nit. A coward and a fool! They wouldn’t understand and they don’t deserve\\nto understand. Why should I go to them? I won’t. Don’t be a child,\\nSonia....”\\n\\n“It will be too much for you to bear, too much!” she repeated, holding\\nout her hands in despairing supplication.\\n\\n“Perhaps I’ve been unfair to myself,” he observed gloomily, pondering,\\n“perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I’ve been in too great\\na hurry to condemn myself. I’ll make another fight for it.”\\n\\nA haughty smile appeared on his lips.\\n\\n“What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole life!”\\n\\n“I shall get used to it,” he said grimly and thoughtfully. “Listen,” he\\nbegan a minute later, “stop crying, it’s time to talk of the facts: I’ve\\ncome to tell you that the police are after me, on my track....”\\n\\n“Ach!” Sonia cried in terror.\\n\\n“Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are\\nfrightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall\\nmake a struggle for it and they won’t do anything to me. They’ve no real\\nevidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but\\nto-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained\\ntwo ways, that’s to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do\\nyou understand? And I shall, for I’ve learnt my lesson. But they will\\ncertainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened,\\nthey would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will\\narrest me to-day.... But that’s no matter, Sonia; they’ll let me out\\nagain... for there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be,\\nI give you my word for it. And they can’t convict a man on what they\\nhave against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will\\ntry to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they\\nwon’t be frightened.... My sister’s future is secure, however, now, I\\nbelieve... and my mother’s must be too.... Well, that’s all. Be careful,\\nthough. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?”\\n\\n“Oh, I will, I will.”\\n\\nThey sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had\\nbeen cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at\\nSonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he\\nfelt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a\\nstrange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that\\nall his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part\\nof his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he\\nsuddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.\\n\\n“Sonia,” he said, “you’d better not come and see me when I am in\\nprison.”\\n\\nSonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.\\n\\n“Have you a cross on you?” she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.\\n\\nHe did not at first understand the question.\\n\\n“No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have\\nanother, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with\\nLizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will\\nwear Lizaveta’s now and give you this. Take it... it’s mine! It’s mine,\\nyou know,” she begged him. “We will go to suffer together, and together\\nwe will bear our cross!”\\n\\n“Give it me,” said Raskolnikov.\\n\\nHe did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the\\nhand he held out for the cross.\\n\\n“Not now, Sonia. Better later,” he added to comfort her.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, better,” she repeated with conviction, “when you go to meet\\nyour suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I’ll put it on you,\\nwe will pray and go together.”\\n\\nAt that moment someone knocked three times at the door.\\n\\n“Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?” they heard in a very familiar and\\npolite voice.\\n\\nSonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.\\nLebeziatnikov appeared at the door.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nLebeziatnikov looked perturbed.\\n\\n“I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he began. “Excuse me... I thought\\nI should find you,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, “that is,\\nI didn’t mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina\\nIvanovna has gone out of her mind,” he blurted out suddenly, turning\\nfrom Raskolnikov to Sonia.\\n\\nSonia screamed.\\n\\n“At least it seems so. But... we don’t know what to do, you see! She\\ncame back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps\\nbeaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father’s former\\nchief, she didn’t find him at home: he was dining at some other\\ngeneral’s.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general’s,\\nand, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to\\nsee her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine what\\nhappened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own\\nstory, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe\\nit.... How it is she wasn’t taken up, I can’t understand! Now she is\\ntelling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it’s difficult to\\nunderstand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,\\nshe shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the\\nchildren and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children\\nwill sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every\\nday under the general’s window... ‘to let everyone see well-born\\nchildren, whose father was an official, begging in the street.’ She\\nkeeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida\\nto sing ‘My Village,’ the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing\\nup all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means\\nto carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won’t\\nlisten to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It’s beyond\\nanything!”\\n\\nLebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost\\nbreathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,\\nputting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and\\nLebeziatnikov came after him.\\n\\n“She has certainly gone mad!” he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out\\ninto the street. “I didn’t want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said\\n‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t a doubt of it. They say that in\\nconsumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity I\\nknow nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t\\nlisten.”\\n\\n“Did you talk to her about the tubercles?”\\n\\n“Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn’t have understood!\\nBut what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he\\nhas nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying. That’s clear. Is it your\\nconviction that he won’t?”\\n\\n“Life would be too easy if it were so,” answered Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for\\nKaterina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have\\nbeen conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the\\ninsane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific\\nman of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such\\ntreatment. His idea was that there’s nothing really wrong with the\\nphysical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a\\nlogical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. He\\ngradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they\\nsay he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how far\\nsuccess was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at\\nleast.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he\\nlived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov\\nwoke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.\\n\\nRaskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle\\nof it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered\\npaper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous\\nknocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose\\non tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of\\nabsorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was\\nhammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the\\nwindow-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out\\nof the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down\\non the sofa.\\n\\nNever, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!\\n\\nYes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now\\nthat he had made her more miserable.\\n\\n“Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison\\nher life? Oh, the meanness of it!”\\n\\n“I will remain alone,” he said resolutely, “and she shall not come to\\nthe prison!”\\n\\nFive minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a\\nstrange thought.\\n\\n“Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,” he thought suddenly.\\n\\nHe could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging\\nthrough his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At\\nfirst she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he\\nhad done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place\\nas yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost\\nvacantly at her.\\n\\n“Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,” said Dounia.\\n\\nHer face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.\\nHe saw that she too had come to him with love.\\n\\n“Brother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and\\ntold me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a\\nstupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that\\nthere is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such\\nhorror. I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must\\nbe, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That’s\\nwhat I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don’t\\njudge you, I don’t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having\\nblamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,\\nshould keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,\\nbut I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that\\nyou will come very soon. Don’t worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at\\nrest; but don’t you try her too much--come once at least; remember that\\nshe is your mother. And now I have come simply to say” (Dounia began\\nto get up) “that if you should need me or should need... all my life or\\nanything... call me, and I’ll come. Good-bye!”\\n\\nShe turned abruptly and went towards the door.\\n\\n“Dounia!” Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. “That Razumihin,\\nDmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.”\\n\\nDounia flushed slightly.\\n\\n“Well?” she asked, waiting a moment.\\n\\n“He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....\\nGood-bye, Dounia.”\\n\\nDounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.\\n\\n“But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that\\nyou... give me such a parting message?”\\n\\n“Never mind.... Good-bye.”\\n\\nHe turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked at\\nhim uneasily, and went out troubled.\\n\\nNo, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)\\nwhen he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,\\nand even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.\\n\\n“Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and\\nwill feel that I stole her kiss.”\\n\\n“And would _she_ stand that test?” he went on a few minutes later to\\nhimself. “No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand things! They\\nnever do.”\\n\\nAnd he thought of Sonia.\\n\\nThere was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was\\nfading. He took up his cap and went out.\\n\\nHe could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all\\nthis continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And\\nif he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this\\ncontinual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession\\nof his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.\\n\\nHe wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had\\nbegun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute\\nabout it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;\\nit brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a\\nforetaste of an eternity “on a square yard of space.” Towards evening\\nthis sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.\\n\\n“With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or\\nsomething, one can’t help doing something stupid! You’ll go to Dounia,\\nas well as to Sonia,” he muttered bitterly.\\n\\nHe heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to\\nhim.\\n\\n“Only fancy, I’ve been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, she’s\\ncarried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and\\nI have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making\\nthe children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the\\ncross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools running\\nafter them. Come along!”\\n\\n“And Sonia?” Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.\\n\\n“Simply frantic. That is, it’s not Sofya Semyonovna’s frantic, but\\nKaterina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova’s frantic too. But Katerina\\nIvanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. They’ll be\\ntaken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....\\nThey are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya\\nSemyonovna’s, quite close.”\\n\\nOn the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one\\nwhere Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally\\nof gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could\\nbe heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle\\nlikely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress\\nwith the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way\\non one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her\\nwasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out\\nof doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.\\nBut her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew\\nmore intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed\\nthem, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began\\nexplaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by\\ntheir not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the\\ncrowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she\\nimmediately appealed to him to see what these children “from a genteel,\\none may say aristocratic, house” had been brought to. If she heard\\nlaughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers\\nand begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their\\nheads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the\\nfrightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken\\nwas not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of\\nrapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,\\nwhen she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in\\nthe singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,\\nwhich made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most\\nfurious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had\\nbeen made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The\\nboy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.\\nThere had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,\\nor rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with\\na broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina\\nIvanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession.\\nPolenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her\\nmother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her\\nmother’s condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly\\nfrightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina\\nIvanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina\\nIvanovna was not to be persuaded.\\n\\n“Leave off, Sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and\\ncoughing. “You don’t know what you ask; you are like a child! I’ve\\ntold you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let\\neveryone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,\\nthough their father was an honourable man who served all his life in\\ntruth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.” (Katerina\\nIvanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly\\nbelieved it.) “Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,\\nSonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I\\nwon’t go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?” she cried, seeing\\nRaskolnikov and rushing up to him. “Explain to this silly girl, please,\\nthat nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their\\nliving, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are\\nan honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general\\nwill lose his post, you’ll see! We shall perform under his windows every\\nday, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children\\nbefore me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is the\\nfather of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, you’ll\\nsee, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,\\nyou’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What\\nare you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion\\nRomanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with\\nsuch children?”\\n\\nAnd she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,\\nrapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried\\nto persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,\\nthat it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like\\nan organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a\\nboarding-school.\\n\\n“A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,” cried Katerina\\nIvanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. “No, Rodion Romanovitch, that\\ndream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,\\nRodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing\\nin the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my\\nname, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!\\nBut enough of them, now I’ll provide for the children myself, I won’t\\nbow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us!” she pointed\\nto Sonia. “Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, only two\\nfarthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run after\\nus, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughing\\nat?” (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) “It’s all because Kolya here\\nis so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?\\nTell me in French, _parlez-moi français_. Why, I’ve taught you, you know\\nsome phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well\\nbrought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We aren’t\\ngoing to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel\\nsong.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,\\nbut we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find\\nsomething to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,\\nas you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it\\nover and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,\\nwhere there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed\\nat once. Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ and\\neveryone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,\\nhave you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you’d help your mother!\\nMy memory’s quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really\\ncan’t sing ‘An Hussar.’ Ah, let us sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’ I have\\ntaught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will\\nsee at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much\\nmore touching.... You might sing ‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre,’\\nfor that’s quite a child’s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the\\naristocratic houses.\\n\\n“_Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_...”\\n she began singing. “But no, better sing ‘Cinq sous.’ Now, Kolya, your\\nhands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other\\nway, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!\\n\\n“_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_.”\\n\\n(Cough-cough-cough!) “Set your dress straight, Polenka, it’s slipped\\ndown on your shoulders,” she observed, panting from coughing. “Now it’s\\nparticularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may\\nsee that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice\\nshould be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,\\nwith your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite\\ndeformed by it.... Why, you’re all crying again! What’s the matter,\\nstupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an\\nunbearable child!\\n\\n“Cinq sous, cinq sous.\\n\\n“A policeman again! What do you want?”\\n\\nA policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that\\nmoment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking\\nofficial of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted\\nKaterina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and\\nwithout a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore\\na look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a\\npolite, even ceremonious, bow.\\n\\n“I thank you, honoured sir,” she began loftily. “The causes that have\\ninduced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and\\nhonourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).\\nYou see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of\\naristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating\\ngrouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. ‘Your excellency,’ I said,\\n‘protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,\\nand on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his\\nonly daughter.’... That policeman again! Protect me,” she cried to the\\nofficial. “Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run\\naway from one of them. What do you want, fool?”\\n\\n“It’s forbidden in the streets. You mustn’t make a disturbance.”\\n\\n“It’s you’re making a disturbance. It’s just the same as if I were\\ngrinding an organ. What business is it of yours?”\\n\\n“You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t got one, and in\\nthat way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?”\\n\\n“What, a license?” wailed Katerina Ivanovna. “I buried my husband\\nto-day. What need of a license?”\\n\\n“Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,” began the official. “Come along;\\nI will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd. You are\\nill.”\\n\\n“Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don’t know,” screamed Katerina\\nIvanovna. “We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! Where is she?\\nShe is crying too! What’s the matter with you all? Kolya, Lida, where\\nare you going?” she cried suddenly in alarm. “Oh, silly children! Kolya,\\nLida, where are they off to?...”\\n\\nKolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their\\nmother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off\\nat the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.\\nWeeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was\\na piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for\\nbreath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.\\n\\n“Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungrateful\\nchildren!... Polenka! catch them.... It’s for your sakes I...”\\n\\nShe stumbled as she ran and fell down.\\n\\n“She’s cut herself, she’s bleeding! Oh, dear!” cried Sonia, bending over\\nher.\\n\\nAll ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the\\nfirst at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the\\npoliceman who muttered, “Bother!” with a gesture of impatience, feeling\\nthat the job was going to be a troublesome one.\\n\\n“Pass on! Pass on!” he said to the crowd that pressed forward.\\n\\n“She’s dying,” someone shouted.\\n\\n“She’s gone out of her mind,” said another.\\n\\n“Lord have mercy upon us,” said a woman, crossing herself. “Have they\\ncaught the little girl and the boy? They’re being brought back, the\\nelder one’s got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!”\\n\\nWhen they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had\\nnot cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood\\nthat stained the pavement red was from her chest.\\n\\n“I’ve seen that before,” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and\\nLebeziatnikov; “that’s consumption; the blood flows and chokes the\\npatient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...\\nnearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What’s to be done though?\\nShe is dying.”\\n\\n“This way, this way, to my room!” Sonia implored. “I live here!... See,\\nthat house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste,” she turned\\nfrom one to the other. “Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!”\\n\\nThanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman\\neven helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia’s\\nroom, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still\\nflowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,\\nLebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were\\nfollowed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed\\nto the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who\\nwere trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the\\nKapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange\\nappearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his\\nwife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several\\nopen-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,\\nSvidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him\\nwith surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having\\nnoticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The\\nofficial whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now\\nfor the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran\\nhimself.\\n\\nMeanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased\\nfor a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at\\nSonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with\\na handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the\\nbed, supporting her on both sides.\\n\\n“Where are the children?” she said in a faint voice. “You’ve brought\\nthem, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!”\\n\\nOnce more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,\\nlooking about her.\\n\\n“So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room.”\\n\\nShe looked at her with a face of suffering.\\n\\n“We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well,\\nhere they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I’ve had\\nenough! The ball is over.” (Cough!) “Lay me down, let me die in peace.”\\n\\nThey laid her back on the pillow.\\n\\n“What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a rouble to spare.\\nI have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have\\nsuffered.... And if He won’t forgive me, I don’t care!”\\n\\nShe sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,\\nturned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,\\nbut at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and\\ndifficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.\\n\\n“I said to him, your excellency,” she ejaculated, gasping after each\\nword. “That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,\\nmake haste! _Glissez, glissez! pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels, be a\\ngraceful child!\\n\\n“_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_\\n\\n“What next? That’s the thing to sing.\\n\\n“_Du hast die schönsten Augen Mädchen, was willst du mehr?_\\n\\n“What an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah,\\nyes!\\n\\n“In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.\\n\\n“Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your\\nfather, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh those\\ndays! Oh that’s the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I’ve\\nforgotten. Remind me! How was it?”\\n\\nShe was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horribly\\nhoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,\\nwith a look of growing terror.\\n\\n“In the heat of midday!... in the vale!... of Dagestan!... With lead in\\nmy breast!...”\\n\\n“Your excellency!” she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and\\na flood of tears, “protect the orphans! You have been their father’s\\nguest... one may say aristocratic....” She started, regaining\\nconsciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once\\nrecognised Sonia.\\n\\n“Sonia, Sonia!” she articulated softly and caressingly, as though\\nsurprised to find her there. “Sonia darling, are you here, too?”\\n\\nThey lifted her up again.\\n\\n“Enough! It’s over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!”\\n she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the\\npillow.\\n\\nShe sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.\\nHer pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg\\nmoved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.\\n\\nSonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless\\nwith her head pressed to the dead woman’s wasted bosom. Polenka threw\\nherself at her mother’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though\\nKolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling\\nthat it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other’s\\nlittle shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened\\ntheir mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy\\ndress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.\\n\\nAnd how did “the certificate of merit” come to be on the bed beside\\nKaterina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.\\n\\nHe walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.\\n\\n“She is dead,” he said.\\n\\n“Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,” said Svidrigaïlov,\\ncoming up to them.\\n\\nLebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.\\nSvidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.\\n\\n“I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. You know\\nit’s a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. I\\nwill put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum,\\nand I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming\\nof age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I\\nwill pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn’t she? So\\ntell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand.”\\n\\n“What is your motive for such benevolence?” asked Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Ah! you sceptical person!” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “I told you I had no\\nneed of that money. Won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity?\\nShe wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the\\ndead woman lay), “was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll\\nagree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to\\ndie? And if I didn’t help them, Polenka would go the same way.”\\n\\nHe said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his\\neyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own\\nphrases, spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at\\nSvidrigaïlov.\\n\\n“How do you know?” he whispered, hardly able to breathe.\\n\\n“Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side of the wall.\\nHere is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted\\nfriend of mine. I am a neighbour.”\\n\\n“You?”\\n\\n“Yes,” continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. “I assure you\\non my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me\\nenormously. I told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well,\\nhere we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am. You’ll\\nsee that you can get on with me!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART VI\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nA strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had\\nfallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there\\nwas no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his\\nmind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with\\nintervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been\\nmistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date\\nof certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his\\nrecollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what\\nother people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained\\nevents as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At\\ntimes he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes\\nto panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,\\nof complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous\\nterror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes\\nseen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape\\nfrom a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential\\nfacts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome\\nto him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the\\nneglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable\\nruin.\\n\\nHe was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be\\npermanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From the time of Svidrigaïlov’s\\ntoo menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia’s room at the moment of\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to\\nbreak down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,\\nRaskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding\\nhimself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched\\neating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had\\ncome there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised\\nsuddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an\\nunderstanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking\\noutside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had\\nfixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another\\ntime he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes\\nand could not at first understand how he had come there.\\n\\nBut during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he\\nhad two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia’s lodging, where he\\nhad gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no\\nreference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not\\nto speak of it for a time.\\n\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was\\nbusy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At\\ntheir last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made\\nan arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s\\nchildren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting\\nhold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at\\nonce placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled\\non them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place\\norphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something\\ntoo about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see\\nRaskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that\\nthere were things they must talk over....”\\n\\nThis conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigaïlov\\nlooked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,\\ndropping his voice, asked: “But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you\\ndon’t seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don’t seem to\\nunderstand. Cheer up! We’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve\\nso much to do of my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion\\nRomanovitch,” he added suddenly, “what all men need is fresh air, fresh\\nair... more than anything!”\\n\\nHe moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who\\nwere coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By\\nSvidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov\\nwent his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed\\nthe priest into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,\\nslowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the\\nthought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive\\nand mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem\\nservice. And there was something else here as well, too awful and\\ndisturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the\\ncoffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it\\nwere, timidly weeping.\\n\\n“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at\\nme,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;\\nthe incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “Give rest, oh Lord....”\\n Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and\\ntook his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,\\nRaskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her\\nhead sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered\\nRaskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of\\nrepugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the\\nfurthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.\\n\\nSonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt\\nvery miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he\\nwould have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life\\nthere. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had\\nnever been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to\\nthe high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier\\nthe place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near\\nhim. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he\\nmade haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter\\nrestaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt\\neasier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour\\nlistening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively\\nenjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,\\nas though his conscience smote him. “Here I sit listening to singing,\\nis that what I ought to be doing?” he thought. Yet he felt at once\\nthat that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something\\nrequiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly\\nunderstand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. “No, better the\\nstruggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better some\\nchallenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!” he thought. He went out of\\nthe tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and\\nhis mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke\\nup before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling\\nall over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he\\narrived. After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up\\nlate, two o’clock in the afternoon.\\n\\nHe remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that\\nday, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him\\nsome food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His\\nhead was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three\\ndays. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.\\n\\nThe door opened and Razumihin came in.\\n\\n“Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,” said Razumihin. He took a chair\\nand sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\\n\\nHe was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident\\nannoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though\\nhe had some special fixed determination.\\n\\n“Listen,” he began resolutely. “As far as I am concerned, you may all go\\nto hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me that I can’t make head or\\ntail of it; please don’t think I’ve come to ask you questions. I don’t\\nwant to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say\\nI shouldn’t stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come\\nto find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There is\\na conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit\\nI’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,\\nrepulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior\\nto your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them\\nas you have; so you must be mad.”\\n\\n“When did you see them last?”\\n\\n“Just now. Haven’t you seen them since then? What have you been doing\\nwith yourself? Tell me, please. I’ve been to you three times already.\\nYour mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up\\nher mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she\\nwouldn’t hear a word. ‘If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can\\nlook after him like his mother?’ she said. We all came here together, we\\ncouldn’t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.\\nWe came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,\\nwhile we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: ‘If he’s\\ngone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it’s\\nhumiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for\\nkindness.’ She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.\\n‘I see,’ she said, ‘that he has time for _his girl_.’ She means by _your\\ngirl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don’t know. I\\nwent at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, for I wanted to know what was going\\non. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and\\nSofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I\\napologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So that’s all\\nnonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most likely thing is that you\\nare mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you’d not had\\na bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but\\nthough you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That I’d\\nswear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,\\nfor there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and I don’t intend to\\nworry my brains over your secrets. So I’ve simply come to swear at you,”\\n he finished, getting up, “to relieve my mind. And I know what to do\\nnow.”\\n\\n“What do you mean to do now?”\\n\\n“What business is it of yours what I mean to do?”\\n\\n“You are going in for a drinking bout.”\\n\\n“How... how did you know?”\\n\\n“Why, it’s pretty plain.”\\n\\nRazumihin paused for a minute.\\n\\n“You always have been a very rational person and you’ve never been mad,\\nnever,” he observed suddenly with warmth. “You’re right: I shall drink.\\nGood-bye!”\\n\\nAnd he moved to go out.\\n\\n“I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think it\\nwas--about you, Razumihin.”\\n\\n“About me! But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?”\\n Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.\\n\\nOne could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.\\n\\n“She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.”\\n\\n“She did!”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“What did you say to her... I mean, about me?”\\n\\n“I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man. I didn’t\\ntell her you love her, because she knows that herself.”\\n\\n“She knows that herself?”\\n\\n“Well, it’s pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,\\nyou would remain to look after them. I, so to speak, give them into your\\nkeeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love\\nher, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too\\nmay love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself,\\nas you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.”\\n\\n“Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go?\\nOf course, if it’s all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall find\\nout the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense\\nand that you’ve made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a\\ncapital fellow!...”\\n\\n“That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was\\na very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it to\\ntime, don’t worry about it. You’ll know it all in time when it must be.\\nYesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh\\nair, fresh air. I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant\\nby that.”\\n\\nRazumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent\\nconclusion.\\n\\n“He’s a political conspirator! He must be. And he’s on the eve of some\\ndesperate step, that’s certain. It can only be that! And... and Dounia\\nknows,” he thought suddenly.\\n\\n“So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,” he said, weighing each\\nsyllable, “and you’re going to see a man who says we need more air, and\\nso of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,”\\n he concluded to himself.\\n\\n“What letter?”\\n\\n“She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Too\\nmuch so. I began speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then... then\\nshe said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began\\nwarmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked\\nherself in.”\\n\\n“She got a letter?” Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Yes, and you didn’t know? hm...”\\n\\nThey were both silent.\\n\\n“Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,\\ngood-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be off\\ntoo. I am not going to drink. There’s no need now.... That’s all stuff!”\\n\\nHe hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he\\nsuddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:\\n\\n“Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry’s, that\\nold woman? Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed\\nand given the proofs. It’s one of those very workmen, the painter, only\\nfancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it, all\\nthat scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs\\nwhile the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on\\npurpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of the\\nyoung dog! One can hardly credit it; but it’s his own explanation, he\\nhas confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well, he’s simply\\na genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of\\nthe lawyers--so there’s nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of course\\npeople like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldn’t keep\\nup the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. But\\nwhat a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!”\\n\\n“Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest\\nyou so?” Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.\\n\\n“What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it from\\nPorfiry, among others... It was from him I heard almost all about it.”\\n\\n“From Porfiry?”\\n\\n“From Porfiry.”\\n\\n“What... what did he say?” Raskolnikov asked in dismay.\\n\\n“He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after his\\nfashion.”\\n\\n“He explained it? Explained it himself?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes; good-bye. I’ll tell you all about it another time, but now\\nI’m busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, another\\ntime!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk\\nwithout wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I’m going. I’ll come again\\nvery soon.”\\n\\nHe went out.\\n\\n“He’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about it,” Razumihin\\ndecided, as he slowly descended the stairs. “And he’s drawn his sister\\nin; that’s quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna’s character.\\nThere are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of\\nher words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this\\ntangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,\\nwhat I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It was\\nhis doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude,\\nnasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And\\nhow clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions...\\nbefore this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....\\nBut what’s the meaning now of that letter? There’s something in that,\\ntoo, perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!”\\n\\nHe thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,\\nand he suddenly broke into a run.\\n\\nAs soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,\\nwalked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the\\nsmallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to\\nspeak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.\\n\\n“Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, too\\ncramping, the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come upon\\nhim at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he\\nhad been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay’s\\nconfession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his\\nbehaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he\\ncould have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and\\nfundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed\\nin his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his\\nmind!\\n\\n“And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle... He worried him, that was true, but\\nsomehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to come\\nwith Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but\\nPorfiry was a different matter.\\n\\n“And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it\\n_psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!\\nPorfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that\\nNikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s\\nappearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only\\n_one_ explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled\\npassages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind\\nrest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they\\nhad exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had\\nreached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the\\nfirst word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.\\n\\n“And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in the\\ncorridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed to\\nPorfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?\\nWhat had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must\\nhave some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It was true that\\na long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight\\nnor sound of Porfiry. Well, that was a bad sign....”\\n\\nRaskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It\\nwas the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind,\\nat least. “I must settle Svidrigaïlov,” he thought, “and as soon as\\npossible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own\\naccord.” And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his\\nweary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or\\nSvidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it\\nlater, if not now.\\n\\n“We shall see, we shall see,” he repeated to himself.\\n\\nBut no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry\\nhimself in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was\\ndumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he\\nwas not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of\\nhim. He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.\\n“Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached\\nso quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing? Could he have been\\nlistening at the door?”\\n\\n“You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,” Porfiry explained,\\nlaughing. “I’ve been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by\\nand thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I won’t\\nkeep you long. Just let me have one cigarette.”\\n\\n“Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.” Raskolnikov gave his visitor\\na seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have\\nmarvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.\\n\\nThe last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man\\nwill sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,\\nyet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.\\n\\nRaskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him\\nwithout flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a\\ncigarette.\\n\\n“Speak, speak,” seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov’s\\nheart. “Come, why don’t you speak?”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n“Ah these cigarettes!” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having\\nlighted one. “They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I\\ncan’t give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and\\na difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to\\nDr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He\\npositively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: ‘Tobacco’s bad for\\nyou,’ he said, ‘your lungs are affected.’ But how am I to give it up?\\nWhat is there to take its place? I don’t drink, that’s the mischief,\\nhe-he-he, that I don’t. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,\\neverything is relative!”\\n\\n“Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,” Raskolnikov thought\\nwith disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly\\ncame back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon\\nhim then.\\n\\n“I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn’t\\nknow?” Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. “I came into\\nthis very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought\\nI’d return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked\\nround, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.\\nDon’t you lock your door?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess\\nhis state of mind.\\n\\n“I’ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!\\nI owe you an explanation and must give it to you,” he continued with a\\nslight smile, just patting Raskolnikov’s knee.\\n\\nBut almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his\\nface; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had\\nnever seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.\\n\\n“A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.\\nOur first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing\\nafter another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;\\nI feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and\\nyour knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviour\\nwas unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all,\\nin any case, gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what we\\ncame to?... and it was quite indecorous.”\\n\\n“What is he up to, what does he take me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself\\nin amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.\\n\\n“I’ve decided openness is better between us,” Porfiry Petrovitch went\\non, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to\\ndisconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.\\n“Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay\\nput a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have come to. That\\ndamned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise\\nthat? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you\\nafterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for\\nanyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn’t? What\\nshall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely\\nsent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).\\nAn idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,\\nRodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for\\na time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan’t lose what I want,\\nanyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;\\nit’s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,\\nwhich I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did\\nreflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and\\nblurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a\\nman lose all patience, though even then it’s rare. I was capable of\\nrealising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact\\nto go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not\\nmerely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get\\nsomething substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising\\nresults indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,\\non your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that\\ntime.”\\n\\n“But what are you driving at now?” Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking\\nthe question without thinking.\\n\\n“What is he talking about?” he wondered distractedly, “does he really\\ntake me to be innocent?”\\n\\n“What am I driving at? I’ve come to explain myself, I consider it my\\nduty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,\\nthe whole misunderstanding arose. I’ve caused you a great deal of\\nsuffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what\\nit must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,\\nimperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!\\nI regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without\\nelements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree with all your convictions.\\nI wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above\\nall I don’t want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt\\nattracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a\\nright to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you’ve no\\nreason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to do\\nall I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart\\nand conscience. I speak sincerely.”\\n\\nPorfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of\\nrenewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent\\nbegan to make him uneasy.\\n\\n“It’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,” Porfiry\\nPetrovitch went on. “Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it. To begin with\\nthere were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to\\nme... and how they affected you, I need not go into. My suspicions\\nwere aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have\\nhappened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that\\neither. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I\\nadmit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was\\nthe first to pitch on you. The old woman’s notes on the pledges and\\nthe rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.\\nI happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who\\ndescribed it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great\\nvividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my\\ndear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a\\nhundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make\\na proof, as the English proverb says, but that’s only from the rational\\npoint of view--you can’t help being partial, for after all a lawyer\\nis only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you\\nremember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the\\ntime, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,\\nyou are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest\\nand... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt\\nthe same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived\\non sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed\\nenthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is\\ndangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary\\namateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of\\nyouth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your\\narticle is absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity,\\na youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. It’s a\\ngloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it. I read your article and\\nput it aside, thinking as I did so ‘that man won’t go the common way.’\\nWell, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being\\ncarried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I\\nam not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is\\nthere in it? I reflected. There’s nothing in it, that is really nothing\\nand perhaps absolutely nothing. And it’s not at all the thing for\\nthe prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have\\nNikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what\\nyou like of it, but it’s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one\\nhas to consider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death. Why am\\nI explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame my\\nmalicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assure\\nyou, he-he! Do you suppose I didn’t come to search your room at the\\ntime? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed,\\nnot officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room was\\nsearched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! I\\nthought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and\\nquickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come. Another man wouldn’t,\\nbut he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the\\nsubject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread\\nrumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a\\nman to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by\\nyour anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurant\\n‘I killed her.’ It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if\\nhe is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought\\nat the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over\\nand... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology\\ncan be taken two ways! Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you\\ncame! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!\\n\\n“Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you\\nremember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn’t expected you\\nso specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You\\nsee what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that\\nstone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhere\\nin a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and\\nafterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began picking\\nyour article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word\\nof yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.\\n\\n“So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and\\nknocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what\\nI was about. After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if\\nyou like, and it’s more natural so, indeed. I couldn’t help admitting\\nit was more natural. I was bothered! ‘No, I’d better get hold of some\\nlittle fact’ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my\\nbreath and was all in a tremor. ‘Here is my little fact,’ thought I, and\\nI didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t. I would have given a thousand\\nroubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you\\nwalked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you\\nmurderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question\\nall the way. And then what about your trembling, what about your\\nbell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?\\n\\n“And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on\\nyou? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to\\nhave sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you\\nremember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was a\\nthunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn’t believe\\nin the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;\\nand how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making\\nvery, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised\\nat him myself, even then I didn’t believe his story! You see what it is\\nto be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _Morgenfrüh_. What has Nikolay\\ngot to do with it!”\\n\\n“Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had\\nyourself assured him of it....”\\n\\nHis voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening in\\nindescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through\\nhim, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not\\nbelieve it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for\\nsomething more definite and conclusive.\\n\\n“Mr. Razumihin!” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question\\nfrom Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. “He-he-he! But I had to\\nput Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is\\nnot the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me\\nwith a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return\\nto Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I\\nunderstand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not\\nexactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, don’t laugh\\nat my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He\\nhas a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells\\nstories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.\\nHe attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger\\nto him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at\\ntimes, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,\\nwithout knowing it himself, for ‘How can it be stealing, if one picks it\\nup?’ And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? There\\nhave been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his\\nvillage under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all\\nthis from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And what’s more, he\\nwanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed at\\nnight, read the old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy.\\n\\n     [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.\\n\\n“Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the\\nwine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I\\nlearnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see\\nhim, and now this business came upon him.\\n\\n“Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can\\none get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The\\nvery word ‘trial’ frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall\\nsee what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in\\nprison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,\\nmade its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of\\nthe word ‘suffering’ among some of these people! It’s not a question of\\nsuffering for someone’s benefit, but simply, ‘one must suffer.’ If they\\nsuffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time\\nthere was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison\\nalways reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself\\ncrazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he\\nseized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him\\nno harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side\\non purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to\\na prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So ‘he took his\\nsuffering.’\\n\\n“So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something\\nof the sort. I know it for certain from facts, indeed. Only he doesn’t\\nknow that I know. What, you don’t admit that there are such fantastic\\npeople among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun\\ninfluencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he’ll\\ncome and tell me all himself. You think he’ll hold out? Wait a bit,\\nhe’ll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to\\ncome and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am\\nstudying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me\\nvery plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence\\nand prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea,\\nknows nothing and doesn’t even suspect that he doesn’t know!\\n\\n“No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn’t come in! This is a fantastic,\\ngloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart\\nof man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood ‘renews,’ when\\ncomfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a\\nheart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage,\\nbut resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over\\na precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the\\ncrime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for\\na theory. He committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, and what\\nhe did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn’t enough for\\nhim to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and\\nrung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to\\nrecall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....\\nWell, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is\\na murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,\\nposes as injured innocence. No, that’s not the work of a Nikolay, my\\ndear Rodion Romanovitch!”\\n\\nAll that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that\\nthese words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though he\\nhad been stabbed.\\n\\n“Then... who then... is the murderer?” he asked in a breathless voice,\\nunable to restrain himself.\\n\\nPorfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at\\nthe question.\\n\\n“Who is the murderer?” he repeated, as though unable to believe his\\nears. “Why, _you_, Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer,” he added,\\nalmost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.\\n\\nRaskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down\\nagain without uttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.\\n\\n“Your lip is twitching just as it did before,” Porfiry Petrovitch\\nobserved almost sympathetically. “You’ve been misunderstanding me, I\\nthink, Rodion Romanovitch,” he added after a brief pause, “that’s why\\nyou are so surprised. I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal\\nopenly with you.”\\n\\n“It was not I murdered her,” Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened\\nchild caught in the act.\\n\\n“No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else,” Porfiry\\nwhispered sternly, with conviction.\\n\\nThey were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten\\nminutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers\\nthrough his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly\\nRaskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.\\n\\n“You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method\\nagain. I wonder you don’t get sick of it!”\\n\\n“Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a different\\nmatter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone. You\\nsee yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.\\nWhether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am\\nconvinced without it.”\\n\\n“If so, what did you come for?” Raskolnikov asked irritably. “I ask you\\nthe same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don’t you take\\nme to prison?”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s your question! I will answer you, point for point. In the\\nfirst place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest.”\\n\\n“How so? If you are convinced you ought....”\\n\\n“Ach, what if I am convinced? That’s only my dream for the time. Why\\nshould I put you in safety? You know that’s it, since you ask me to do\\nit. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him\\n‘were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be\\ndrunk, and you were drunk, too.’ Well, what could I answer, especially\\nas your story is a more likely one than his? for there’s nothing but\\npsychology to support his evidence--that’s almost unseemly with his ugly\\nmug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate\\ndrunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several\\ntimes already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the\\nsecond way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from\\nthat I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you in\\nprison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you\\nof it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,\\nthat it won’t be to my advantage. Well, secondly, I’ve come to you\\nbecause...”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, secondly?” Raskolnikov was listening breathless.\\n\\n“Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation. I\\ndon’t want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking\\nfor you, you may believe me or not. And in the third place I’ve come to\\nyou with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender\\nand confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my\\nadvantage too, for my task will be done. Well, is this open on my part\\nor not?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov thought a minute.\\n\\n“Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but\\npsychology to go on, yet now you’ve gone on mathematics. Well, what if\\nyou are mistaken yourself, now?”\\n\\n“No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even\\nthen, Providence sent it me.”\\n\\n“What little fact?”\\n\\n“I won’t tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I haven’t\\nthe right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you. So think it over:\\nit makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.\\nBelieve me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov smiled malignantly.\\n\\n“That’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless. Why, even if I\\nwere guilty, which I don’t admit, what reason should I have to confess,\\nwhen you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?”\\n\\n“Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in words, perhaps\\nprison will not be altogether a restful place. That’s only theory and\\nmy theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am\\nhiding something from you? I can’t lay bare everything, he-he! And how\\ncan you ask what advantage? Don’t you know how it would lessen your\\nsentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken\\nthe crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I\\nswear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall\\ncome as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these\\npsychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime\\nwill appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it\\nwas an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep\\nmy word.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink\\ndejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his\\nsmile was sad and gentle.\\n\\n“No!” he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances\\nwith Porfiry, “it’s not worth it, I don’t care about lessening the\\nsentence!”\\n\\n“That’s just what I was afraid of!” Porfiry cried warmly and, as it\\nseemed, involuntarily. “That’s just what I feared, that you wouldn’t\\ncare about the mitigation of sentence.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.\\n\\n“Ah, don’t disdain life!” Porfiry went on. “You have a great deal of\\nit still before you. How can you say you don’t want a mitigation of\\nsentence? You are an impatient fellow!”\\n\\n“A great deal of what lies before me?”\\n\\n“Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it? Seek\\nand ye shall find. This may be God’s means for bringing you to Him. And\\nit’s not for ever, the bondage....”\\n\\n“The time will be shortened,” laughed Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that you\\nare afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anyway\\n_you_ shouldn’t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.”\\n\\n“Ach, hang it!” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as\\nthough he did not want to speak aloud.\\n\\nHe got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in\\nevident despair.\\n\\n“Hang it, if you like! You’ve lost faith and you think that I am\\ngrossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do\\nyou understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke\\ndown and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something\\nbase, that’s true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!\\nAt least you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the\\nfurthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as one\\nof those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts\\ntheir entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it and\\nyou will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too,\\nis a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.\\nI know you don’t believe in it--but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself\\nstraight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid--the flood\\nwill bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What\\nbank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before\\nyou. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared\\nbeforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use\\nsome time. That’s why I speak. It’s as well that you only killed the\\nold woman. If you’d invented another theory you might perhaps have\\ndone something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God,\\nperhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.\\nBut keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great\\nexpiation before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since\\nyou have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justice\\nin it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you don’t\\nbelieve it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it\\ndown in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov positively started.\\n\\n“But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic\\ncalm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?”\\n\\n“Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that’s all. A man\\nperhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day\\nis over. But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.\\nThough, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come\\nto nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another\\nclass of men? It’s not comfort you regret, with your heart! What of\\nit that perhaps no one will see you for so long? It’s not time, but\\nyourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. The\\nsun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? At my being\\nsuch a Schiller? I bet you’re imagining that I am trying to get round\\nyou by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps you’d better not\\nbelieve my word, perhaps you’d better never believe it altogether--I’m\\nmade that way, I confess it. But let me add, you can judge for yourself,\\nI think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest.”\\n\\n“When do you mean to arrest me?”\\n\\n“Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, my\\ndear fellow, and pray to God. It’s more in your interest, believe me.”\\n\\n“And what if I run away?” asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.\\n\\n“No, you won’t run away. A peasant would run away, a fashionable\\ndissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man’s thought, for\\nyou’ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he’ll be ready\\nto believe in anything for the rest of his life. But you’ve ceased to\\nbelieve in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what\\nwould you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and\\nwhat you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an\\natmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If\\nyou ran away, you’d come back to yourself. _You can’t get on without\\nus._ And if I put you in prison--say you’ve been there a month, or two,\\nor three--remember my word, you’ll confess of yourself and perhaps to\\nyour own surprise. You won’t know an hour beforehand that you are coming\\nwith a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, ‘to take your\\nsuffering.’ You don’t believe my words now, but you’ll come to it of\\nyourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never\\nmind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don’t laugh at it,\\nthere’s an idea in suffering, Nikolay is right. No, you won’t run away,\\nRodion Romanovitch.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.\\n\\n“Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only we don’t\\nhave a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air.”\\n\\nHe, too, took his cap.\\n\\n“Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that I have\\nconfessed to you to-day,” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.\\n“You’re a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.\\nBut I have admitted nothing, remember that!”\\n\\n“Oh, I know that, I’ll remember. Look at him, he’s trembling! Don’t\\nbe uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. Walk about a bit, you\\nwon’t be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request\\nto make of you,” he added, dropping his voice. “It’s an awkward one, but\\nimportant. If anything were to happen (though indeed I don’t believe\\nin it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken\\nduring these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to\\nthe business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands\\non yourself--(it’s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for\\nit) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the\\nstone. It will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts and\\nsound decisions to you!”\\n\\nPorfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The\\nlatter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he\\ncalculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then he\\ntoo went hurriedly out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nHe hurried to Svidrigaïlov’s. What he had to hope from that man he\\ndid not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once\\nrecognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.\\n\\nOn the way, one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigaïlov been\\nto Porfiry’s?\\n\\nAs far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not. He\\npondered again and again, went over Porfiry’s visit; no, he hadn’t been,\\nof course he hadn’t.\\n\\nBut if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for the present he\\nfancied he couldn’t. Why? He could not have explained, but if he could,\\nhe would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It all\\nworried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange to\\nsay, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague\\nanxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more important anxiety\\ntormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.\\nMoreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was\\nworking better that morning than it had done of late.\\n\\nAnd was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with\\nthese new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while, for instance, to\\nmanoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry’s? Was it worth\\nwhile to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone\\nlike Svidrigaïlov?\\n\\nOh, how sick he was of it all!\\n\\nAnd yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be expecting\\nsomething _new_ from him, information, or means of escape? Men will\\ncatch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?\\nPerhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov\\nbut some other whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented\\nhimself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg\\nher tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him as\\nan irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment\\nespecially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be\\nbetter to try Svidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning that\\nhe had long felt that he must see him for some reason.\\n\\nBut what could they have in common? Their very evil-doing could not\\nbe of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently\\ndepraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such\\nstories were told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina\\nIvanovna’s children, but who could tell with what motive and what it\\nmeant? The man always had some design, some project.\\n\\nThere was another thought which had been continually hovering of late\\nabout Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was so\\npainful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes\\nthought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov had\\nfound out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them\\nstill? Wasn’t it practically certain that he had? And what if, having\\nlearnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it\\nas a weapon against Dounia?\\n\\nThis idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never\\npresented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov.\\nThe very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this would\\ntransform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to\\nconfess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps\\nto prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning\\nDounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in\\nPetersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It’s true Razumihin was there to protect\\nher, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty\\nto tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.\\n\\nIn any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decided\\nfinally. Thank God, the details of the interview were of little\\nconsequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but\\nif Svidrigaïlov were capable... if he were intriguing against\\nDounia--then...\\n\\nRaskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month\\nthat he could only decide such questions in one way; “then I shall kill\\nhim,” he thought in cold despair.\\n\\nA sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of\\nthe street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he\\nwas going. He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from\\nthe Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of\\nthe house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide\\nopen; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were\\nfull to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and\\nviolin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.\\nHe was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,\\nwhen suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting\\nat a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.\\nRaskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov\\nwas silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov\\nat once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.\\nRaskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking\\nabsent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.\\nHis heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov\\ndid not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on\\nthe point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his\\nchair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen\\nhim, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the\\nsame as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A\\nsly smile came into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and\\nbroader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last\\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.\\n\\n“Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!” he shouted from the\\nwindow.\\n\\nRaskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny\\nback room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers\\nof people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the\\ndesperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls\\ncould be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood\\nan open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found\\nalso a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl\\nof eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with\\nribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some\\nservants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of\\nthe organ.\\n\\n“Come, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov’s\\nentrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.\\nShe had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful\\nexpression in her face.\\n\\n“Hey, Philip, a glass!” shouted Svidrigaïlov.\\n\\n“I won’t drink anything,” said Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t want\\nanything more to-day, you can go.” He poured her out a full glass, and\\nlaid down a yellow note.\\n\\nKatia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,\\nin twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he\\nallowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed\\nafter her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.\\nSvidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him\\nwas already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,\\nwas by now an old friend and very obsequious.\\n\\nThe door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was at\\nhome in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was\\ndirty and wretched, not even second-rate.\\n\\n“I was going to see you and looking for you,” Raskolnikov began, “but\\nI don’t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect\\njust now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay\\nMarket. And this isn’t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.\\nIt is strange!”\\n\\n“Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?”\\n\\n“Because it may be only chance.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “You won’t\\nadmit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say\\nthat it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about\\nhaving an opinion of their own, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I\\ndon’t mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to\\nhave it. That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.”\\n\\n“Nothing else?”\\n\\n“Well, that’s enough, you know,” Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated,\\nbut only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.\\n\\n“I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having\\nwhat you call an opinion of my own,” observed Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And\\napropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep\\nfor the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there\\nis no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,\\ntold you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you\\nremember?”\\n\\n“I don’t remember,” answered Raskolnikov with surprise.\\n\\n“I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped\\nmechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet\\nprecisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of\\nit. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give\\nyourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I’m\\nconvinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves\\nas they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific\\nmen, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable\\ninvestigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places\\nwhere there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul\\nof man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.\\nAnd it’s the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must\\nbe reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there\\nnow. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out\\nof your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it\\nsink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see\\nnothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and\\ntalking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at\\nlast stand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the thing.\\nSomeone may be watching you besides me, and it won’t do you any good.\\nIt’s nothing really to do with me and I can’t cure you, but, of course,\\nyou understand me.”\\n\\n“Do you know that I am being followed?” asked Raskolnikov, looking\\ninquisitively at him.\\n\\n“No, I know nothing about it,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised.\\n\\n“Well, then, let us leave me alone,” Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.\\n\\n“Very good, let us leave you alone.”\\n\\n“You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me\\ntwice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just\\nnow when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it.”\\n\\n“He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and\\npretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your\\ndoorway? I saw it.”\\n\\n“I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself.”\\n\\n“And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know them.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the\\nfingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov. For a\\nfull minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It\\nwas a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,\\nwith a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow\\ntoo blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was\\nsomething awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so\\nwonderfully young for his age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light\\nsummer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge\\nring with a precious stone in it.\\n\\n“Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?” said Raskolnikov\\nsuddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. “Even\\nthough perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,\\nI don’t want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I\\ndon’t prize myself as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell you at\\nonce that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister\\nand if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has\\nbeen discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.\\nYou can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the\\nsecond place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all\\nthis time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,\\nfor time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.”\\n\\n“Why in such haste?” asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously.\\n\\n“Everyone has his plans,” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.\\n\\n“You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question\\nyou refuse to answer,” Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile. “You\\nkeep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with\\nsuspicion. Of course it’s perfectly natural in your position. But\\nthough I should like to be friends with you, I shan’t trouble myself\\nto convince you of the contrary. The game isn’t worth the candle and I\\nwasn’t intending to talk to you about anything special.”\\n\\n“What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me.”\\n\\n“Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the\\nfantastic nature of your position--that’s what it was! Besides you are\\nthe brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person\\nI had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I\\ngathered that you had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough?\\nHa-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and\\nis difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me\\nnot only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something\\nnew. Isn’t that so? Isn’t that so?” persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly\\nsmile. “Well, can’t you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the\\ntrain was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my\\nmaking some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!”\\n\\n“What profit could you make?”\\n\\n“How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all\\nmy time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s to say it’s no great enjoyment,\\nbut one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only\\nI had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.”\\n\\nHe pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a\\nterrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.\\n\\n“Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and want nothing more.\\nI don’t drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch\\nanything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even\\nthat is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind\\nmyself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a\\npeculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a\\nschoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe,” he\\npulled out his watch, “I can spend an hour with you. It’s half-past\\nfour now. If only I’d been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry\\nofficer, a photographer, a journalist... I am nothing, no specialty,\\nand sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me\\nsomething new.”\\n\\n“But what are you, and why have you come here?”\\n\\n“What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the\\ncavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa\\nPetrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!”\\n\\n“You are a gambler, I believe?”\\n\\n“No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler.”\\n\\n“You have been a card-sharper then?”\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve been a card-sharper too.”\\n\\n“Didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?”\\n\\n“It did happen. Why?”\\n\\n“Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been\\nlively.”\\n\\n“I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I\\nconfess that I hastened here for the sake of the women.”\\n\\n“As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?”\\n\\n“Quite so,” Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. “What of it? You\\nseem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?”\\n\\n“You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?”\\n\\n“Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you in order,\\nfirst about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,\\nwhat should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I\\nhave a passion for them? It’s an occupation, anyway.”\\n\\n“So you hope for nothing here but vice?”\\n\\n“Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway\\nI like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something\\npermanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,\\nsomething present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever\\nsetting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even\\nwith years. You’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.”\\n\\n“That’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a dangerous one.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like\\neverything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must\\nexceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one way\\nor another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate\\nand prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn’t\\nthis, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent\\nman ought to put up with being bored, but yet...”\\n\\n“And could you shoot yourself?”\\n\\n“Oh, come!” Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. “Please don’t speak of\\nit,” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown\\nin all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. “I admit it’s\\nan unpardonable weakness, but I can’t help it. I am afraid of death and\\nI dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extent\\na mystic?”\\n\\n“Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visiting\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound\\nthem!” he cried with an air of irritation. “Let’s rather talk of that...\\nthough... H’m! I have not much time, and can’t stay long with you,\\nit’s a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you.”\\n\\n“What’s your engagement, a woman?”\\n\\n“Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that’s not what I want to talk\\nof.”\\n\\n“And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn’t\\nthat affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?”\\n\\n“And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just\\nnow, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.\\nYou preach to me about vice and æsthetics! You--a Schiller, you--an\\nidealist! Of course that’s all as it should be and it would be\\nsurprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,\\nwhat a pity I have no time, for you’re a most interesting type! And,\\nby-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.”\\n\\n“But what a braggart you are,” Raskolnikov said with some disgust.\\n\\n“Upon my word, I am not,” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. “However, I\\nwon’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no\\none? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when\\nI come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly\\ninteresting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that\\nhalf-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little. And besides,\\nthere’s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that\\nI... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?” he asked in alarm.\\n\\nRaskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and,\\nas it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that\\nSvidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.\\n\\n“A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!” Svidrigaïlov begged. “Let them bring\\nyou some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk nonsense, about\\nmyself, I mean. I’ll tell you something. If you like I’ll tell you how a\\nwoman tried ‘to save’ me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to\\nyour first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell\\nyou? It will help to spend the time.”\\n\\n“Tell me, but I trust that you...”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,\\nAvdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n“You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself,” began Svidrigaïlov, “that\\nI was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not\\nany expectation of being able to pay it. There’s no need to go into\\nparticulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a\\npoint of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,\\nand very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe\\nthat this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and\\nreproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which\\nshe kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than\\nI, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There\\nwas so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to\\ntell her straight out that I couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her.\\nThis confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have\\nliked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to\\ndeceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous\\nwoman, you know, that’s the first consideration. After many tears an\\nunwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never\\nleave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I\\nwould never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would\\nnever set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa\\nPetrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her\\nsecret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of\\nour class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by\\na great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On\\nthis last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a\\nsensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute\\nprofligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous\\nwoman are two very different things, and that’s where the trouble\\ncame in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain\\npreconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people\\nabout us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than\\nin anyone’s. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was\\nridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very\\nridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the\\ninnumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and that’s enough, I\\nthink, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife\\nof a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue\\nand did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to\\nattain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were\\ntimes when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn’t\\nput up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a\\nbeautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that\\nMarfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell\\nin love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, little\\nwonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance\\nand what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. But Avdotya\\nRomanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? Would you\\nbelieve it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first\\nfor my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception\\nof her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I don’t know\\nwhat it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya\\nRomanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of\\ntelling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually\\ncomplaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful\\nnew friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt\\nAvdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were\\ncurrent about me.... I don’t mind betting that you too have heard\\nsomething of the sort already?”\\n\\n“I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is\\nthat true?”\\n\\n“Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,” said Svidrigaïlov with\\ndisgust and annoyance. “If you insist on wanting to know about all that\\nidiocy, I will tell you one day, but now...”\\n\\n“I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you\\ntreated badly.”\\n\\n“I beg you to drop the subject,” Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with\\nobvious impatience.\\n\\n“Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...\\nyou told me about it yourself.” Raskolnikov felt more and more\\nirritated.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught\\na flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But Svidrigaïlov restrained\\nhimself and answered very civilly:\\n\\n“Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall\\nfeel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon\\nmy soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with\\nsome people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having\\nrepeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip\\nabout me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any\\ncase it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovna’s natural\\naversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she\\ndid at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a\\ngirl’s heart is moved to _pity_, it’s more dangerous than anything. She\\nis bound to want to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift\\nhim up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and\\nusefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once\\nthat the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.\\nI think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch? There’s no need. As you\\nknow, it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)\\nDo you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn’t\\nyour sister’s fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as\\nthe daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia\\nMinor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure\\nmartyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot\\npincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or\\nfifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and\\nwould have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and\\nvisions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and\\nif she can’t get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve\\nheard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he’s said to be a sensible fellow;\\nhis surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably a divinity student. Well,\\nhe’d better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am\\nproud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one\\nis apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang it\\nall, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it began on\\nmy side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is\\nawfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you\\nthis about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in\\nspite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There\\nhappened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed\\nwench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another\\nvillage--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,\\nwailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.\\nOne day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in\\nthe garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha\\nalone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,\\nwas only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,\\nembarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,\\nmysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even\\ntears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for\\npropaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on\\nmy destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally\\nresorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the\\nfemale heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s the well-known\\nresource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the\\ntruth and nothing easier than flattery. If there’s the hundredth part\\nof a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that\\nleads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it\\nis just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be\\na coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the\\nflattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for all\\nstages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be\\nseduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once\\nseduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her\\nprinciples. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really\\nhad principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being\\nutterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her\\nshamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of\\nthe hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having\\nsnatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that\\nI could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.\\nI maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my\\ntreachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In\\nfact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was\\ninnocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and\\nhad succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I\\nexplained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was\\njust as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of\\nflattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property\\nsettled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine\\nnow and talking too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now\\nthat I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.\\nBut I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had\\nseveral times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by\\nthe expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a\\nlight in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and\\nmore unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,\\nbut we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the\\ncoarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha\\ncame on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a\\ntremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your\\nsister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this\\nmoment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.\\nI assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of\\nher dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think\\nthat I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could\\nbe moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,\\nbut by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what\\na pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake\\nanything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya\\nRomanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word...\\nbut does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by\\nher work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you\\nare frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty\\nthousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with\\nme here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,\\nrapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time\\nthat if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat\\nand to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in\\nthe catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I\\nwas when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly\\nattorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would\\nreally have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn’t it?\\nWouldn’t it? I notice that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you\\ninteresting young man....”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.\\nRaskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne\\nthat he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he\\nresolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious\\nof Svidrigaïlov.\\n\\n“Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have\\ncome to Petersburg with designs on my sister,” he said directly to\\nSvidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further.\\n\\n“Oh, nonsense,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. “Why, I\\ntold you... besides your sister can’t endure me.”\\n\\n“Yes, I am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.”\\n\\n“Are you so sure that she can’t?” Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and\\nsmiled mockingly. “You are right, she doesn’t love me, but you can\\nnever be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and\\nmistress. There’s always a little corner which remains a secret to\\nthe world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that\\nAvdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?”\\n\\n“From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still have\\ndesigns--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out\\npromptly.”\\n\\n“What, have I dropped words like that?” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve\\ndismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his\\ndesigns.\\n\\n“Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? What\\nare you so afraid of now?”\\n\\n“Me--afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, _cher\\nami_. But what nonsense.... I’ve drunk too much though, I see that. I\\nwas almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!”\\n\\nHe snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of\\nthe window. Philip brought the water.\\n\\n“That’s all nonsense!” said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it\\nto his head. “But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your\\nsuspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?”\\n\\n“You told me so before.”\\n\\n“Did I? I’ve forgotten. But I couldn’t have told you so for certain for\\nI had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I really\\nhave a betrothed and it’s a settled thing, and if it weren’t that I have\\nbusiness that can’t be put off, I would have taken you to see them\\nat once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten\\nminutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it’s an\\ninteresting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?\\nGoing again?”\\n\\n“No, I’m not going away now.”\\n\\n“Not at all? We shall see. I’ll take you there, I’ll show you my\\nbetrothed, only not now. For you’ll soon have to be off. You have to go\\nto the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the\\nwoman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you’re thinking, that she’s\\nthe woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are\\nyou listening? She arranged it all for me. You’re bored, she said,\\nyou want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,\\ndepressed person. Do you think I’m light-hearted? No, I’m gloomy. I do\\nno harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a\\ntime. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has\\ngot in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and\\ndepart, and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our\\nclass, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down\\nretired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three\\nyears with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible\\nwoman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn’t help;\\nthere is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn’t visit them. And\\nthey’ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children\\nwere not enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest daughter,\\na girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be\\nmarried. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present\\nmyself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,\\nwith a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks\\nof that? But it’s fascinating, isn’t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You\\nshould have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying\\nto have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,\\nstill in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had\\nbeen told, no doubt. I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but\\nto my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears\\nof bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little\\npicture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb’s, full little rosy\\nlips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was\\nin a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is\\nthe day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on\\nmy knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset\\nand I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that\\nthis is her husband and that this must be so. It’s simply delicious! The\\npresent betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you\\nhave what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha! I’ve talked to her\\ntwice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that\\npositively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael’s Madonna. You know,\\nthe Sistine Madonna’s face has something fantastic in it, the face\\nof mournful religious ecstasy. Haven’t you noticed it? Well, she’s\\nsomething in that line. The day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her\\npresents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and\\nanother of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all\\nsorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna’s face glowed. I sat her\\non my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she\\nflushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn’t want to show it.\\nWe were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first\\ntime of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and\\nvowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make\\nme happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would\\nsacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is\\nmy _respect_, and that she wants ‘nothing, nothing more from me, no\\npresents.’ You’ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an\\nangel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush\\nof maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is\\nrather fascinating! Isn’t it fascinating? It’s worth paying for, isn’t\\nit? Well... listen, we’ll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!”\\n\\n“The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites\\nyour sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?”\\n\\n“Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who\\nknows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about\\nvirtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!”\\n\\n“But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...\\nthough you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now.”\\n\\n“I am always fond of children, very fond of them,” laughed Svidrigaïlov.\\n“I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I\\nvisited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. You\\nprobably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my\\nold friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when\\nI was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought\\nof these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great\\ndeal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young\\npeople, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams\\nand visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are\\namassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From\\nthe first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be\\nin a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and\\nthere was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you\\nhave progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely\\ndressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one\\n_vis-à-vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can’t\\nfancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at\\nlast felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began\\nwhirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I\\nlike your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,\\n‘Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well,\\nit’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or\\nnot. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by\\nsaying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and\\nthat they couldn’t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,\\ngave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them\\nhome in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were\\nlodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the\\ncountry. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my\\nacquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their\\nown and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my\\nservices and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon\\nby mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to\\nassist in the young girl’s education in French and dancing. My offer was\\naccepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... If\\nyou like, we’ll go and see them, only not just now.”\\n\\n“Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual\\nman!”\\n\\n“Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_\\nBut you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure\\nof hearing your outcries!”\\n\\n“I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself,” muttered Raskolnikov\\nangrily.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,\\nand began getting up.\\n\\n“I say, but I am drunk, _assez causé_,” he said. “It’s been a pleasure.”\\n\\n“I should rather think it must be a pleasure!” cried Raskolnikov,\\ngetting up. “No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to\\ndescribe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in\\nhis mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as\\nme.... It’s stimulating!”\\n\\n“Well, if you come to that,” Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising\\nRaskolnikov with some surprise, “if you come to that, you are a thorough\\ncynic yourself. You’ve plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand\\na great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely\\nregret not having had more talk with you, but I shan’t lose sight of\\nyou.... Only wait a bit.”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after\\nhim. Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him\\nfor a moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied\\nwith something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited\\nand uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had\\nchanged during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering\\nevery moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He\\nbecame very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.\\n\\nThey came out on to the pavement.\\n\\n“You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.\\nOnly _adieu, mon plaisir_, may we meet again.”\\n\\nAnd he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nRaskolnikov walked after him.\\n\\n“What’s this?” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, “I thought I said...”\\n\\n“It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\nBoth stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their\\nstrength.\\n\\n“From all your half tipsy stories,” Raskolnikov observed harshly, “I am\\n_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but\\nare pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister\\nreceived a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still\\nall this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that\\nmeans nothing. I should like to make certain myself.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he\\nwished to make certain.\\n\\n“Upon my word! I’ll call the police!”\\n\\n“Call away!”\\n\\nAgain they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigaïlov’s\\nface changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not\\nfrightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.\\n\\n“What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,\\nthough I am devoured by curiosity. It’s a fantastic affair. I’ve put it\\noff till another time, but you’re enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let\\nus go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,\\nto get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to\\nspend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going to follow me?”\\n\\n“I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to\\nsay I’m sorry not to have been at the funeral.”\\n\\n“That’s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken\\nthe three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some\\norphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by\\ndepositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of\\nKaterina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her\\ntoo the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.\\nIt produced an indescribable effect on her. That’s why Sofya Semyonovna\\nhas been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is\\nstaying for the time.”\\n\\n“No matter, I’ll come all the same.”\\n\\n“As you like, it’s nothing to me, but I won’t come with you; here we are\\nat home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion\\njust because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled\\nyou with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I\\ndon’t mind betting it’s that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!”\\n\\n“And to listen at doors!”\\n\\n“Ah, that’s it, is it?” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “Yes, I should have been\\nsurprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!\\nThough I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and\\nwere telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps\\nI am quite behind the times and can’t understand. For goodness’ sake,\\nexplain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!”\\n\\n“You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re making it all up!”\\n\\n“But I’m not talking about that (though I did hear something). No, I’m\\ntalking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in\\nyou is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at\\ndoors. If that’s how you feel, go and inform the police that you had\\nthis mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are\\nconvinced that one mustn’t listen at doors, but one may murder old women\\nat one’s pleasure, you’d better be off to America and make haste. Run,\\nyoung man! There may still be time. I’m speaking sincerely. Haven’t you\\nthe money? I’ll give you the fare.”\\n\\n“I’m not thinking of that at all,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.\\n\\n“I understand (but don’t put yourself out, don’t discuss it if you don’t\\nwant to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,\\naren’t they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are\\nnothing to you now, ha-ha! You’ll say you are still a man and a citizen.\\nIf so you ought not to have got into this coil. It’s no use taking up a\\njob you are not fit for. Well, you’d better shoot yourself, or don’t you\\nwant to?”\\n\\n“You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.”\\n\\n“What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You\\nsee, that’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home.\\nDon’t you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here\\nis Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has she\\ngone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won’t be till late in\\nthe evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see\\nme, didn’t you? Here we are. Madame Resslich’s not at home. She is a\\nwoman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might\\nhave been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now,\\nsee! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot\\nI’ve got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. I\\nmustn’t waste any more time. The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,\\nand here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? I’m going to\\nthe Islands. Would you like a lift? I’ll take this carriage. Ah, you\\nrefuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on\\nto rain. Never mind, we’ll put down the hood....”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his\\nsuspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a\\nword he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only\\nturned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a\\nhundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But he\\nhad turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him\\naway from Svidrigaïlov.\\n\\n“To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that\\ncoarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!” he cried.\\n\\nRaskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was\\nsomething about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a\\nmysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced\\nthat Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome\\nand unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.\\n\\nWhen he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as\\nusual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and\\nbegan gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.\\n\\nHe met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing\\nher. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was\\nstruck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call\\nto him or not. Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the\\ndirection of the Hay Market.\\n\\nHe seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the\\nbridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid\\nRaskolnikov’s seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had\\nbeen making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not\\nto speak to her brother, but to come to him.\\n\\nThat was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to\\nSvidrigaïlov.\\n\\n“Let us make haste away,” Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, “I don’t want\\nRodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you I’ve been\\nsitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and\\nI had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of\\nmy letter to you and suspects something. It wasn’t you who told him, of\\ncourse, but if not you, who then?”\\n\\n“Well, we’ve turned the corner now,” Dounia interrupted, “and my brother\\nwon’t see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.\\nSpeak to me here. You can tell it all in the street.”\\n\\n“In the first place, I can’t say it in the street; secondly, you must\\nhear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....\\nOh well, if you won’t agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give\\nany explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that\\na very curious secret of your beloved brother’s is entirely in my\\nkeeping.”\\n\\nDounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with\\nsearching eyes.\\n\\n“What are you afraid of?” he observed quietly. “The town is not the\\ncountry. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you.”\\n\\n“Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?”\\n\\n“No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she\\nis at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother\\nto-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I\\ndon’t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken\\nto you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like\\nthis. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the porter\\nof our house--he knows me very well; you see, he’s bowing; he sees I’m\\ncoming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you\\nwill be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse\\nmy putting things so coarsely. I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya\\nSemyonovna’s room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The\\nwhole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?\\nAm I really so terrible?”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in\\nno smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.\\nHe spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not\\nnotice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that\\nshe was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to\\nher.\\n\\n“Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the\\nleast afraid of you. Lead the way,” she said with apparent composure,\\nbut her face was very pale.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia’s room.\\n\\n“Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How\\nunfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she’s gone out, it\\ncan only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....\\nI’ve been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna\\ndoes not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if\\nyou like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,\\nmy landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you\\nmy chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two\\nperfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must look\\ninto them with some attention.”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was\\nlooking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the\\nfurniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,\\nfor instance, that Svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of\\nalmost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly\\nfrom the passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty rooms.\\nUnlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia\\nthe two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not\\nknowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to\\nexplain.\\n\\n“Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it’s locked.\\nBy the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it\\nfrom my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of\\nthe door is Sofya Semyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to Rodion\\nRomanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for\\ntwo hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what\\ndo you think?”\\n\\n“You listened?”\\n\\n“Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can’t sit down here.”\\n\\nHe brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her\\na chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven\\nfeet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which\\nhad once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked\\nabout her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently\\ndid not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of\\nSvidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask\\nwhether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from\\nasking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably\\ngreater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.\\n\\n“Here is your letter,” she said, laying it on the table. “Can it be true\\nwhat you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.\\nYou hint at it too clearly; you daren’t deny it now. I must tell you\\nthat I’d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don’t believe a\\nword of it. It’s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story\\nand why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to\\nprove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don’t believe you! I don’t\\nbelieve you!”\\n\\nDounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour\\nrushed to her face.\\n\\n“If you didn’t believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?\\nWhy have you come? Simply from curiosity?”\\n\\n“Don’t torment me. Speak, speak!”\\n\\n“There’s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought\\nyou would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not\\nwith you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It’s spirited of\\nyou, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything\\nis divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You’ve\\njust seen him yourself. What did you think of him?”\\n\\n“Surely that’s not the only thing you are building on?”\\n\\n“No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successive\\nevenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I’ve shown you where they sat. He made\\na full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a\\npawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister\\ntoo, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he\\nwas murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with\\nhim. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and\\nvarious things.... He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,\\nthe only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by word\\nor deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Don’t\\nbe anxious, she won’t betray him.”\\n\\n“It cannot be,” muttered Dounia, with white lips. She gasped for breath.\\n“It cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....\\nIt’s a lie, a lie!”\\n\\n“He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things. It’s true\\nthat by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid\\nthem under a stone, where they are now. But that was because he dared\\nnot make use of them.”\\n\\n“But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?” cried Dounia,\\nand she jumped up from the chair. “Why, you know him, and you’ve seen\\nhim, can he be a thief?”\\n\\nShe seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten her\\nfear.\\n\\n“There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,\\nAvdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I’ve\\nheard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely he\\nthought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have\\nbelieved it myself if I’d been told of it as you have, but I believe my\\nown ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but\\nshe did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at\\nlast.”\\n\\n“What... were the causes?”\\n\\n“It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here’s... how shall I tell\\nyou?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider\\nthat a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a\\nsolitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! It’s galling too, of\\ncourse, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if\\nhe had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his\\nwhole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three\\nthousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging\\nin a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social\\nposition and his sister’s and mother’s position too. Above all, vanity,\\npride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities\\ntoo.... I am not blaming him, please don’t think it; besides, it’s not\\nmy business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of a\\nsort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,\\nthat is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their\\nsuperiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that\\nis. It’s all right as a theory, _une théorie comme une autre_. Napoleon\\nattracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a\\ngreat many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have\\noverstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied\\nthat he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He\\nhas suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he\\ncould make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,\\nand so he is not a man of genius. And that’s humiliating for a young man\\nof any pride, in our day especially....”\\n\\n“But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is he like that?”\\n\\n“Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was\\never in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas,\\nAvdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to\\nthe fantastic, the chaotic. But it’s a misfortune to be broad without\\na special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on\\nthis subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why,\\nyou used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking\\nat the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There\\nare no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,\\nAvdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for\\nhimself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the\\nmost part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost\\nill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. I\\nnever blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But\\nwe’ve talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to\\ninterest you in my opinions.... You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna.”\\n\\n“I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all is\\npermitted. Razumihin brought it to me.”\\n\\n“Mr. Razumihin? Your brother’s article? In a magazine? Is there such an\\narticle? I didn’t know. It must be interesting. But where are you going,\\nAvdotya Romanovna?”\\n\\n“I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,” Dounia articulated faintly. “How do I\\ngo to her? She has come in, perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhaps\\nshe...”\\n\\nAvdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.\\n\\n“Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.\\nShe was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in\\ntill quite late.”\\n\\n“Ah, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the\\ntime.... I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!” cried Dounia,\\ncompletely losing her head.\\n\\nAlmost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to\\ngive her.\\n\\n“Avdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.\\nDrink a little....”\\n\\nHe sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.\\n\\n“It has acted violently,” Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning.\\n“Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he has friends. We will\\nsave him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money, I can get\\na ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of\\ngood deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great\\nman yet. Well, how are you? How do you feel?”\\n\\n“Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go...”\\n\\n“Where are you going?”\\n\\n“To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came in\\nat that door and now it is locked. When did you manage to lock it?”\\n\\n“We couldn’t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am far\\nfrom jeering; it’s simply that I’m sick of talking like this. But how\\ncan you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will drive\\nhim to fury, and he will give himself up. Let me tell you, he is already\\nbeing watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be giving\\nhim away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He\\ncan still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.\\nI asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to\\nconsider it thoroughly. But do sit down!”\\n\\n“How can you save him? Can he really be saved?”\\n\\nDounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her.\\n\\n“It all depends on you, on you, on you alone,” he began with glowing\\neyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for\\nemotion.\\n\\nDounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.\\n\\n“You... one word from you, and he is saved. I... I’ll save him. I have\\nmoney and friends. I’ll send him away at once. I’ll get a passport,\\ntwo passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable\\npeople.... If you like, I’ll take a passport for you... for your\\nmother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love\\nyou beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let\\nme.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, ‘do that,’\\nand I’ll do it. I’ll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you\\nbelieve, I will believe. I’ll do anything--anything! Don’t, don’t look\\nat me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?...”\\n\\nHe was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to\\nhis head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.\\n\\n“Open it! Open it!” she called, shaking the door. “Open it! Is there no\\none there?”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly\\nbroke into an angry mocking smile.\\n\\n“There is no one at home,” he said quietly and emphatically. “The\\nlandlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout like that. You\\nare only exciting yourself uselessly.”\\n\\n“Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!”\\n\\n“I have lost the key and cannot find it.”\\n\\n“This is an outrage,” cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She rushed\\nto the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a\\nlittle table.\\n\\nShe did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched\\nevery movement he made.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.\\nHe was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was\\npale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.\\n\\n“You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you\\nmay be sure I’ve taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The\\nKapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at\\nleast twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.\\nFor you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing\\nactually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. How\\nshould a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?\\nSo that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.\\nIt is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.”\\n\\n“Scoundrel!” whispered Dounia indignantly.\\n\\n“As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general\\nproposition. It’s my personal conviction that you are perfectly\\nright--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need have\\nno remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your\\nown accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to\\ncircumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think\\nabout it. Your brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands. I\\nwill be your slave... all my life... I will wait here.”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had\\nnot the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides, she\\nknew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it\\nand laid it in her hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.\\n\\n“Aha! So that’s it, is it?” he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.\\n“Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. You’ve made things\\nwonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the\\nrevolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it’s my revolver, an old friend!\\nAnd how I’ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons I’ve given you in the\\ncountry have not been thrown away.”\\n\\n“It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,\\nwretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I began\\nto suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, I\\nswear I’ll kill you.” She was frantic.\\n\\n“But your brother? I ask from curiosity,” said Svidrigaïlov, still\\nstanding where he was.\\n\\n“Inform, if you want to! Don’t stir! Don’t come nearer! I’ll shoot! You\\npoisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!” She held the\\nrevolver ready.\\n\\n“Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?”\\n\\n“You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I know\\nyou went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing....\\nIt must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!”\\n\\n“Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would\\nhave been the cause.”\\n\\n“You are lying! I hated you always, always....”\\n\\n“Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened\\nto me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember\\nthat moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?”\\n\\n“That’s a lie,” there was a flash of fury in Dounia’s eyes, “that’s a\\nlie and a libel!”\\n\\n“A lie? Well, if you like, it’s a lie. I made it up. Women ought not\\nto be reminded of such things,” he smiled. “I know you will shoot, you\\npretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!”\\n\\nDounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the\\ndistance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was\\nwhite and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had\\nnever seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment\\nshe raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of\\nanguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The\\nbullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and\\nlaughed softly.\\n\\n“The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. What’s this?\\nBlood?” he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed\\nin a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just\\ngrazed the skin.\\n\\nDounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in\\nterror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what\\nshe was doing and what was going on.\\n\\n“Well, you missed! Fire again, I’ll wait,” said Svidrigaïlov softly,\\nstill smiling, but gloomily. “If you go on like that, I shall have time\\nto seize you before you cock again.”\\n\\nDounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.\\n\\n“Let me be,” she cried in despair. “I swear I’ll shoot again. I... I’ll\\nkill you.”\\n\\n“Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don’t...\\nthen.” His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot\\nagain: it missed fire.\\n\\n“You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge\\nthere. Get it ready, I’ll wait.”\\n\\nHe stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild\\ndetermination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia\\nsaw that he would sooner die than let her go. “And... now, of course she\\nwould kill him, at two paces!” Suddenly she flung away the revolver.\\n\\n“She’s dropped it!” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep\\nbreath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only\\nthe fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.\\nIt was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,\\nwhich he could not himself have defined.\\n\\nHe went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not\\nresist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.\\nHe tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to\\nutter a sound.\\n\\n“Let me go,” Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now was\\nquite different.\\n\\n“Then you don’t love me?” he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.\\n\\n“And... and you can’t? Never?” he whispered in despair.\\n\\n“Never!”\\n\\nThere followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of\\nSvidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly\\nhe withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.\\nAnother moment passed.\\n\\n“Here’s the key.”\\n\\nHe took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table\\nbehind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.\\n\\n“Take it! Make haste!”\\n\\nHe looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to\\ntake the key.\\n\\n“Make haste! Make haste!” repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning\\nor moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that\\n“make haste.”\\n\\nDounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it\\nquickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she\\nran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he\\nslowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A\\nstrange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of\\ndespair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.\\nHe looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.\\nThe revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly\\ncaught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket\\nthree-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still\\ntwo charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He\\nthought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went\\nout.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nHe spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to\\nanother. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain\\n\\n“villain and tyrant,”\\n\\n“began kissing Katia.”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and\\nthe waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these\\nclerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the\\nleft and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure\\ngarden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky\\nthree-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a\\n“Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was\\nserved, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.\\nA chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed\\nGerman clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The\\nclerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.\\nSvidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for\\na quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no\\npossibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was\\nthat one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in\\nselling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his\\ncompanion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon\\nbelonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem\\ntroublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of\\nthe garden. It was about six o’clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine\\nall this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than\\nanything.\\n\\nIt was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over\\nthe sky about ten o’clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain\\ncame down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the\\nearth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each\\nflash lasted while one could count five.\\n\\nDrenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the\\nbureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,\\nputting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,\\nbut, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the\\nrain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room\\nwithout locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.\\n\\nShe was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She\\nwas giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,\\nlooking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at\\nonce in indescribable terror.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.\\nShe timidly prepared to listen.\\n\\n“I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and\\nas I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some\\narrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to\\nyou, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those\\npeople have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your\\nbrother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them\\nI’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had\\nbetter take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take\\nthem! Well now, that’s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the\\nvalue of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for\\nyourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one\\nknows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on\\nliving in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no\\nneed for it now.”\\n\\n“I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my\\nstepmother,” said Sonia hurriedly, “and if I’ve said so little... please\\ndon’t consider...”\\n\\n“That’s enough! that’s enough!”\\n\\n“But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,\\nbut I don’t need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don’t think me\\nungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money....”\\n\\n“It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste words\\nover it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch\\nhas two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked\\nwildly at him, and started.) “Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from\\nhimself and I am not a gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice\\nwhen you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much\\nbetter for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and\\nyou will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need money.\\nYou’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same\\nas my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay\\nwhat’s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so\\nheedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not\\nyours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.\\nYou can’t get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned\\nabout me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don’t say\\nanything about my coming to see you now and don’t show the money to\\nanyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye.” (He got up.) “My\\ngreetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you’d better put the money\\nfor the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of\\ncourse you do. He’s not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...\\nwhen the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.”\\n\\nSonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.\\nShe longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she\\ndid not dare and did not know how to begin.\\n\\n“How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?”\\n\\n“Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,\\nSofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to\\nothers. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.\\nTell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure\\nto.”\\n\\nHe went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague\\napprehension.\\n\\nIt appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,\\nhe made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still\\npersisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where\\nthe parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky\\nIsland. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit\\nat first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be\\nvery fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very\\nintelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had\\nprobably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing\\nvanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see\\nSvidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the\\nconversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct\\nquestion, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she\\nwere obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov\\nwould like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and\\nalmost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only\\nby degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other\\noccasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady\\nIvanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his\\nbetrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she\\nhad already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important\\naffairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her\\nfifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from\\nhim, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present\\nbefore their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his\\nimmediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that\\npurpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went\\noff very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,\\nthe inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the\\nother hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced\\nby tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigaïlov got up,\\nlaughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon\\ncome back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a\\nsort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though\\nhe felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be\\nimmediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He\\nwent away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but\\nthe tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of\\nthe most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was\\na great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great\\nwealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start\\noff on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that\\nthere was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he\\nwas wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,\\nand all these people of high society didn’t think of what was said of\\nthem and didn’t stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that\\non purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a\\nword should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and\\nthe money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the\\ncook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said\\nto that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up\\nwhispering till two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,\\namazed and rather sorrowful.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the\\nway back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring\\nwind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black\\nwaters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.\\nBut he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and\\nwent towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long\\ntime, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the\\nwooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side\\nof the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that\\nthere was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly\\nlarge, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was\\nnot mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place\\nthat he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,\\nblackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were\\nlights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked\\na ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,\\nscanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a\\nclose and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under\\nthe stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow\\nlooked inquiringly.\\n\\n“Is there tea?” asked Svidrigaïlov.\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“What else is there?”\\n\\n“Veal, vodka, savouries.”\\n\\n“Bring me tea and veal.”\\n\\n“And you want nothing else?” he asked with apparent surprise.\\n\\n“Nothing, nothing.”\\n\\nThe ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\\n\\n“It must be a nice place,” thought Svidrigaïlov. “How was it I didn’t\\nknow it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have\\nhad some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed\\nhere?”\\n\\nHe lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a\\nroom so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;\\nit had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained\\nchair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they\\nwere made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty\\nthat the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general\\ncolour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short\\nby the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under\\nthe stairs.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into\\nthought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout\\nin the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from\\nthe moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and\\nalmost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw\\nlight through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The\\nroom, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of\\nthem, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing\\nin the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to\\npreserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached\\nthe other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He\\ndeclared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn\\nhim out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it\\nall. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the\\nair of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t. He sometimes\\nturned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not\\nthe slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A\\ncandle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly\\nempty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs\\nof stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away\\nindifferently and sat down on the bed.\\n\\nThe ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking\\nhim again whether he didn’t want anything more, and again receiving a\\nnegative reply, finally withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a\\nglass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began\\nto feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the\\nblanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. “It would have been better\\nto be well for the occasion,” he thought with a smile. The room was\\nclose, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard\\na mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of\\nleather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He\\nfelt a longing to fix his imagination on something. “It must be a garden\\nunder the window,” he thought. “There’s a sound of trees. How I dislike\\nthe sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a\\nhorrid feeling.” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed\\nPetrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little\\nNeva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. “I never have\\nliked water,” he thought, “even in a landscape,” and he suddenly smiled\\nagain at a strange idea: “Surely now all these questions of taste and\\ncomfort ought not to matter, but I’ve become more particular, like an\\nanimal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought\\nto have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,\\nha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why\\nhaven’t I put out the candle?” he blew it out. “They’ve gone to bed next\\ndoor,” he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. “Well, now, Marfa\\nPetrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very\\ntime and place for you. But now you won’t come!”\\n\\nHe suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on\\nDounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin’s\\nkeeping. “I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to\\ntease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a\\ngood deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over\\nhis nonsense. But now he’s _too_ eager for life. These young men\\nare contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please\\nhimself, it’s nothing to do with me.”\\n\\nHe could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image rose before him,\\nand a shudder ran over him. “No, I must give up all that now,” he\\nthought, rousing himself. “I must think of something else. It’s queer\\nand funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly\\ndesired to avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad\\nsign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that’s\\na bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!\\nBut--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me\\nsomehow....”\\n\\nHe ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia’s image\\nrose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,\\nshe had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that\\nhe might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand\\nto defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that\\ninstant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his\\nheart...\\n\\n“Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!”\\n\\nHe was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly\\nsomething seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He\\nstarted. “Ugh! hang it! I believe it’s a mouse,” he thought, “that’s the\\nveal I left on the table.” He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the\\nblanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over\\nhis leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking\\nwith feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.\\nHe shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.\\nHe tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without\\nleaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and\\nsuddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one\\ninstant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down\\nhis back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.\\n\\nThe room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket\\nas before. The wind was howling under the window. “How disgusting,” he\\nthought with annoyance.\\n\\nHe got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the\\nwindow. “It’s better not to sleep at all,” he decided. There was a cold\\ndamp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the\\nblanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of\\nanything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,\\nincoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his\\nmind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or\\nthe dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees\\nroused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling\\non images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,\\nwarm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country\\ncottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with\\nflower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was\\nsurrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with\\nrich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed\\nparticularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant\\nnarcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was\\nreluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came\\ninto a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,\\nthe doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.\\nThe floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows\\nwere open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were\\nchirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table\\ncovered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was\\ncovered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of\\nflowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a\\nwhite muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as\\nthough carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was\\na wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of\\nher face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her\\npale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.\\nSvidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle\\nbeside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.\\nShe was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed\\nherself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish\\nsoul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn\\nfrom her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on\\na dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the\\nwindow. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously\\ninto the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with\\nhis shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been\\nsomething like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,\\nprobably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of\\nrain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as\\nin a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of\\nobjects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,\\ngazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed\\nby a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. “Ah, the\\nsignal! The river is overflowing,” he thought. “By morning it will be\\nswirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and\\ncellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain\\nand wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is\\nit now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on\\nthe wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\\n\\n“Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out at once\\nstraight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,\\nso that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on\\none’s head.”\\n\\nHe moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his\\nwaistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,\\ninto the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep\\nsomewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay\\nhim for the room and leave the hotel. “It’s the best minute; I couldn’t\\nchoose a better.”\\n\\nHe walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding\\nanyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner\\nbetween an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object\\nwhich seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little\\ngirl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her\\nclothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of\\nSvidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big\\nblack eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been\\ncrying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child’s face\\nwas pale and tired, she was numb with cold. “How can she have come here?\\nShe must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began questioning\\nher. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby\\nlanguage, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,” and\\nabout some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without\\nstopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a\\nneglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service\\nof the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken\\na cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the\\nevening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the\\nrain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and\\nspent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness\\nand the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his\\narms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing\\nher. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as\\nwet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had\\nundressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in\\nthe blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he\\nsank into dreary musing again.\\n\\n“What folly to trouble myself,” he decided suddenly with an oppressive\\nfeeling of annoyance. “What idiocy!” In vexation he took up the candle\\nto go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.\\n“Damn the child!” he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again\\nto see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.\\nThe child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,\\nand her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed\\nbrighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. “It’s a flush\\nof fever,” thought Svidrigaïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as\\nthough she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were\\nhot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long\\nblack eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a\\nsly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little\\ngirl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in\\na smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to\\ncontrol them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,\\na broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite\\nunchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the\\nshameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they\\nturned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited\\nhim.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that\\nlaugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. “What,\\nat five years old?” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. “What does\\nit mean?” And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding\\nout her arms.... “Accursed child!” Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand\\nto strike her, but at that moment he woke up.\\n\\nHe was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not\\nbeen lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.\\n\\n“I’ve had nightmare all night!” He got up angrily, feeling utterly\\nshattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could\\nsee nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,\\nput on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his\\npocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his\\npocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few\\nlines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his\\nelbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some\\nflies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on\\nthe table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began\\ntrying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.\\nAt last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he\\nstarted, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he\\nwas in the street.\\n\\nA thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov walked along the\\nslippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing\\nthe waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,\\nthe wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the\\nbush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think\\nof something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.\\nThe bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with\\ntheir closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and\\nhe began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read\\neach carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and\\ncame to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with\\nits tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead\\ndrunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower\\nstood up on the left. “Bah!” he shouted, “here is a place. Why should\\nit be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness\\nanyway....”\\n\\nHe almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where\\nthere was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of\\nthe house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,\\nwrapped in a grey soldier’s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his\\nhead. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His\\nface wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly\\nprinted on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,\\nSvidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes\\nwithout speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man\\nnot drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a\\nword.\\n\\n“What do you want here?” he said, without moving or changing his\\nposition.\\n\\n“Nothing, brother, good morning,” answered Svidrigaïlov.\\n\\n“This isn’t the place.”\\n\\n“I am going to foreign parts, brother.”\\n\\n“To foreign parts?”\\n\\n“To America.”\\n\\n“America.”\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his\\neyebrows.\\n\\n“I say, this is not the place for such jokes!”\\n\\n“Why shouldn’t it be the place?”\\n\\n“Because it isn’t.”\\n\\n“Well, brother, I don’t mind that. It’s a good place. When you are\\nasked, you just say he was going, he said, to America.”\\n\\nHe put the revolver to his right temple.\\n\\n“You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,” cried Achilles, rousing\\nhimself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.\\n\\nSvidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nThe same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on\\nhis way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev’s\\nhouse which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from\\nthe street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still\\nhesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:\\nhis decision was taken.\\n\\n“Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and\\nthey are used to thinking of me as eccentric.”\\n\\nHe was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a\\nnight’s rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the\\ninward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all\\nthe previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a\\ndecision.\\n\\nHe knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not\\nat home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by\\nthe hand and drew him into the room.\\n\\n“Here you are!” she began, faltering with joy. “Don’t be angry with\\nme, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not\\ncrying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I’ve got\\ninto such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I’ve been like that ever\\nsince your father’s death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you\\nmust be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are.”\\n\\n“I was in the rain yesterday, mother....” Raskolnikov began.\\n\\n“No, no,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, “you thought I\\nwas going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don’t be\\nanxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I’ve learned the ways\\nhere and truly I see for myself that they are better. I’ve made up my\\nmind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to\\ngive an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have,\\nor what ideas you are hatching; so it’s not for me to keep nudging your\\nelbow, asking you what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why\\nam I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading your\\narticle in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch\\nbrought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: ‘There,\\nfoolish one,’ I thought, ‘that’s what he is busy about; that’s the\\nsolution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may\\nhave some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I\\nworry him and upset him.’ I read it, my dear, and of course there was a\\ngreat deal I did not understand; but that’s only natural--how should I?”\\n\\n“Show me, mother.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruous\\nas it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and\\nbitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he\\nsees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only\\na moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed\\nwith anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding\\nmonths. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.\\n\\n“But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you\\nwill very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the\\nworld of Russian thought. And they dared to think you were mad! You\\ndon’t know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures,\\nhow could they understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all but\\nbelieving it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice to\\nmagazines--the first time poems (I’ve got the manuscript and will show\\nyou) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it\\nout) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren’t! I was\\nbreaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your\\nclothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolish\\nI was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and\\ntalent. No doubt you don’t care about that for the present and you are\\noccupied with much more important matters....”\\n\\n“Dounia’s not at home, mother?”\\n\\n“No, Rodya. I often don’t see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri\\nProkofitch comes to see me, it’s so good of him, and he always talks\\nabout you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I don’t say that\\nDounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has\\nher ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and\\nI never have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that Dounia\\nhas far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don’t\\nknow what it will all lead to. You’ve made me so happy by coming now,\\nRodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I’ll tell\\nher: ‘Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all\\nthis time?’ You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,\\nbut if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway,\\nthat you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what\\nyou write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you’ll\\ncome yourself to see me. What could be better? Here you’ve come now to\\ncomfort your mother, I see that.”\\n\\nHere Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.\\n\\n“Here I am again! Don’t mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I\\nsitting here?” she cried, jumping up. “There is coffee and I don’t offer\\nyou any. Ah, that’s the selfishness of old age. I’ll get it at once!”\\n\\n“Mother, don’t trouble, I am going at once. I haven’t come for that.\\nPlease listen to me.”\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.\\n\\n“Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are\\ntold about me, will you always love me as you do now?” he asked suddenly\\nfrom the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and\\nnot weighing them.\\n\\n“Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?\\nWhy, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn’t believe\\nanyone, I should refuse to listen.”\\n\\n“I’ve come to assure you that I’ve always loved you and I am glad\\nthat we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,” he went on with the same\\nimpulse. “I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you\\nmust believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all\\nyou thought about me, that I was cruel and didn’t care about you, was\\nall a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that’s enough:\\nI thought I must do this and begin with this....”\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her\\nbosom and weeping gently.\\n\\n“I don’t know what is wrong with you, Rodya,” she said at last. “I’ve\\nbeen thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see\\nthat there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that’s why you are\\nmiserable. I’ve foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking\\nabout it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister\\nlay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I\\ncaught something, but I couldn’t make it out. I felt all the morning\\nas though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting\\nsomething, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You\\nare going away somewhere?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“That’s what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need\\nme. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya\\nSemyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon\\nher as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.\\nBut... where... are you going?”\\n\\n“Good-bye, mother.”\\n\\n“What, to-day?” she cried, as though losing him for ever.\\n\\n“I can’t stay, I must go now....”\\n\\n“And can’t I come with you?”\\n\\n“No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps will\\nreach Him.”\\n\\n“Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That’s right, that’s\\nright. Oh, God, what are we doing?”\\n\\nYes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that\\nhe was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awful\\nmonths his heart was softened. He fell down before her, he kissed her\\nfeet and both wept, embracing. And she was not surprised and did not\\nquestion him this time. For some days she had realised that something\\nawful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had\\ncome for him.\\n\\n“Rodya, my darling, my first born,” she said sobbing, “now you are just\\nas when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me and\\nkiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us\\nsimply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we\\nwept together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if I’ve been crying\\nlately, it’s that my mother’s heart had a foreboding of trouble. The\\nfirst time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived\\nhere, I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-day\\nwhen I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had\\ncome. Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?”\\n\\n“No!”\\n\\n“You’ll come again?”\\n\\n“Yes... I’ll come.”\\n\\n“Rodya, don’t be angry, I don’t dare to question you. I know I mustn’t.\\nOnly say two words to me--is it far where you are going?”\\n\\n“Very far.”\\n\\n“What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for you?”\\n\\n“What God sends... only pray for me.” Raskolnikov went to the door, but\\nshe clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face worked\\nwith terror.\\n\\n“Enough, mother,” said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.\\n\\n“Not for ever, it’s not yet for ever? You’ll come, you’ll come\\nto-morrow?”\\n\\n“I will, I will, good-bye.” He tore himself away at last.\\n\\nIt was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.\\nRaskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all\\nbefore sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the\\nstairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him\\nintently. “Can anyone have come to see me?” he wondered. He had a\\ndisgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She\\nwas sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had\\nbeen waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from\\nthe sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him,\\nbetrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw at\\nonce that she knew.\\n\\n“Am I to come in or go away?” he asked uncertainly.\\n\\n“I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.\\nWe thought that you would be sure to come there.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.\\n\\n“I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this\\nmoment to be able to control myself.”\\n\\nHe glanced at her mistrustfully.\\n\\n“Where were you all night?”\\n\\n“I don’t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind\\nonce for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that\\nI wanted to end it all there, but... I couldn’t make up my mind,” he\\nwhispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.\\n\\n“Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and\\nI. Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov smiled bitterly.\\n\\n“I haven’t faith, but I have just been weeping in mother’s arms; I\\nhaven’t faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. I don’t know\\nhow it is, Dounia, I don’t understand it.”\\n\\n“Have you been at mother’s? Have you told her?” cried Dounia,\\nhorror-stricken. “Surely you haven’t done that?”\\n\\n“No, I didn’t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.\\nShe heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it\\nalready. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I don’t know why I did\\ngo. I am a contemptible person, Dounia.”\\n\\n“A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, aren’t\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of\\ndrowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that\\nif I had considered myself strong till now I’d better not be afraid of\\ndisgrace,” he said, hurrying on. “It’s pride, Dounia.”\\n\\n“Pride, Rodya.”\\n\\nThere was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad\\nto think that he was still proud.\\n\\n“You don’t think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?” he\\nasked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.\\n\\n“Oh, Rodya, hush!” cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two\\nminutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the\\nother end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got\\nup.\\n\\n“It’s late, it’s time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I\\ndon’t know why I am going to give myself up.”\\n\\nBig tears fell down her cheeks.\\n\\n“You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?”\\n\\n“You doubted it?”\\n\\nShe threw her arms round him.\\n\\n“Aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?” she\\ncried, holding him close and kissing him.\\n\\n“Crime? What crime?” he cried in sudden fury. “That I killed a vile\\nnoxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killing\\nher was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor\\npeople. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking\\nof expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? ‘A\\ncrime! a crime!’ Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,\\nnow that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. It’s simply\\nbecause I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,\\nperhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!”\\n\\n“Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood?” cried\\nDounia in despair.\\n\\n“Which all men shed,” he put in almost frantically, “which flows and has\\nalways flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which\\nmen are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of\\nmankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to\\ndo good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds\\nto make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply\\nclumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now\\nthat it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that\\nstupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to\\ntake the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have\\nbeen smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...\\nI couldn’t carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,\\nthat’s what’s the matter! And yet I won’t look at it as you do. If I had\\nsucceeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I’m trapped.”\\n\\n“But that’s not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?”\\n\\n“Ah, it’s not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive! I fail to\\nunderstand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.\\nThe fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I’ve never,\\nnever recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever\\nfrom seeing that what I did was a crime. I’ve never, never been stronger\\nand more convinced than now.”\\n\\nThe colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered\\nhis last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia’s eyes and he saw such\\nanguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that he\\nhad, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,\\nthe cause...\\n\\n“Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven\\nif I am guilty). Good-bye! We won’t dispute. It’s time, high time to go.\\nDon’t follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go.... But you\\ngo at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! It’s my last request\\nof you. Don’t leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that\\nshe is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with\\nher! Razumihin will be with you. I’ve been talking to him.... Don’t cry\\nabout me: I’ll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a\\nmurderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I won’t disgrace you,\\nyou will see; I’ll still show.... Now good-bye for the present,” he\\nconcluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia’s\\neyes at his last words and promises. “Why are you crying? Don’t cry,\\ndon’t cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I’d\\nforgotten!”\\n\\nHe went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took\\nfrom between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It was\\nthe portrait of his landlady’s daughter, who had died of fever, that\\nstrange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the\\ndelicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave\\nit to Dounia.\\n\\n“I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,” he said\\nthoughtfully. “To her heart I confided much of what has since been so\\nhideously realised. Don’t be uneasy,” he returned to Dounia, “she was\\nas much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great\\npoint is that everything now is going to be different, is going to\\nbe broken in two,” he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection.\\n“Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?\\nThey say it is necessary for me to suffer! What’s the object of these\\nsenseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I\\nam crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty\\nyears’ penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I\\nconsenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood\\nlooking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!”\\n\\nAt last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.\\nShe walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look\\nat him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for\\nthe last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,\\nhe motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the\\ncorner abruptly.\\n\\n“I am wicked, I see that,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a\\nmoment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. “But why are they so fond\\nof me if I don’t deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved\\nme and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would have\\nhappened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so\\nmeek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word\\nthat I am a criminal? Yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s what they are\\nsending me there for, that’s what they want. Look at them running to and\\nfro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at\\nheart and, worse still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they’d be\\nwild with righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!”\\n\\nHe fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could\\nbe humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.\\nAnd yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual\\nbondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should\\nhe live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be\\nso? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that\\nquestion since the previous evening, but still he went.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nWhen he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark. All day\\nSonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been\\nwaiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering\\nSvidrigaïlov’s words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the\\nconversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.\\nDounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her\\nbrother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his\\nconfession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;\\nshe would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,\\nbut she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and\\nat first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point\\nof tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at\\nDounia. Dounia’s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively\\nand respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had\\nremained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\\n\\nDounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her\\nbrother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come\\nthere first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread\\nof his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent\\nthe day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both\\nwere less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each\\nthought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to\\nher the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...\\nBesides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.\\n\\n“Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to\\nmake him live?” she thought at last in despair.\\n\\nMeanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking\\nintently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the\\nunwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to\\nfeel sure of his death--he walked into the room.\\n\\nShe gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned\\npale.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling. “I have come for your cross, Sonia. It\\nwas you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened\\nnow it’s come to that?”\\n\\nSonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold\\nshiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the\\nwords were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid\\nmeeting her eyes.\\n\\n“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. There is one\\nfact.... But it’s a long story and there’s no need to discuss it. But\\ndo you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish\\nfaces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid\\nquestions, which I shall have to answer--they’ll point their fingers at\\nme.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I’d\\nrather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise\\nhim, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I’ve become\\ntoo irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my\\nsister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It’s\\na brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the\\ncrosses?”\\n\\nHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or\\nconcentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after\\none another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.\\n\\nWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress\\nwood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and\\nover him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.\\n\\n“It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed. “As though I\\nhad not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant\\none; the copper one, that is Lizaveta’s--you will wear yourself, show\\nme! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like\\nthese too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old\\nwoman’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I\\nought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what\\nmatters; I’m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,\\nSonia, so that you might know... that’s all--that’s all I came for. But\\nI thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I\\nam going to prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you crying\\nfor? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!”\\n\\nBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. “Why\\nis she grieving too?” he thought to himself. “What am I to her? Why does\\nshe weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll\\nbe my nurse.”\\n\\n“Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,” Sonia begged in a timid\\nbroken voice.\\n\\n“Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely....”\\n\\nBut he wanted to say something quite different.\\n\\nHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put\\nit over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which\\nMarmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that\\nlooking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he\\nwas certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was\\nfrightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia\\nmeant to go with him.\\n\\n“What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I’ll go\\nalone,” he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved\\ntowards the door. “What’s the use of going in procession?” he muttered\\ngoing out.\\n\\nSonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said\\ngood-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt\\nsurged in his heart.\\n\\n“Was it right, was it right, all this?” he thought again as he went down\\nthe stairs. “Couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”\\n\\nBut still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask\\nhimself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he\\nhad not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of\\nthe room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted\\nat her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another\\nthought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike\\nhim then.\\n\\n“Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on\\nbusiness; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was\\n_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away\\njust now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No,\\nI wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart\\nached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some\\nfriendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what\\nI would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!”\\n\\nHe walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But\\non reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it\\nwent to the Hay Market.\\n\\nHe looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and\\ncould not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. “In\\nanother week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this\\nbridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember\\nthis!” slipped into his mind. “Look at this sign! How shall I read those\\nletters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a thing to remember,\\nthat letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look\\nat it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial\\nit all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be\\ninteresting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am\\nbecoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how\\npeople shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against\\nme, does he know whom he pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby,\\nbegging. It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might\\ngive her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five copeck\\npiece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my\\ngood woman!”\\n\\n“God bless you,” the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.\\n\\nHe went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be\\nin a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have\\ngiven anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he\\nwould not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and\\ndisorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There\\nwas a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,\\nstared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short\\njerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,\\nthough he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he\\nwas; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly\\ncame over him, overwhelming him body and mind.\\n\\nHe suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, “Go to the cross-roads, bow down to\\nthe people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say\\naloud to the whole world, ‘I am a murderer.’” He trembled, remembering\\nthat. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially\\nof the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively\\nclutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came\\nover him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and\\nspreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the\\ntears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....\\n\\nHe knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and\\nkissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed\\ndown a second time.\\n\\n“He’s boozed,” a youth near him observed.\\n\\nThere was a roar of laughter.\\n\\n“He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children\\nand his country. He’s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great\\ncity of St. Petersburg and its pavement,” added a workman who was a\\nlittle drunk.\\n\\n“Quite a young man, too!” observed a third.\\n\\n“And a gentleman,” someone observed soberly.\\n\\n“There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”\\n\\nThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, “I am\\na murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,\\ndied away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking\\nround, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a\\nglimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt\\nthat it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he\\nsaw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding\\nfrom him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had\\nfollowed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt\\nand knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow\\nhim to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his\\nheart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.\\n\\nHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third\\nstorey. “I shall be some time going up,” he thought. He felt as though\\nthe fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time\\nleft for consideration.\\n\\nAgain the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral\\nstairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and\\nthe same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been\\nhere since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but\\nstill they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to\\ncollect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. “But why? what for?” he\\nwondered, reflecting. “If I must drink the cup what difference does it\\nmake? The more revolting the better.” He imagined for an instant the\\nfigure of the “explosive lieutenant,” Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually\\ngoing to him? Couldn’t he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?\\nCouldn’t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings?\\nAt least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the “explosive\\nlieutenant”! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\\n\\nTurning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.\\nThere were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a\\npeasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.\\nRaskolnikov walked into the next room. “Perhaps I still need not speak,”\\n passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was\\nsettling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was\\nseating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.\\n\\n“No one in?” Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.\\n\\n“Whom do you want?”\\n\\n“A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the\\nRussian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I’ve forgotten! ‘At\\nyour service!’” a familiar voice cried suddenly.\\n\\nRaskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He\\nhad just come in from the third room. “It is the hand of fate,” thought\\nRaskolnikov. “Why is he here?”\\n\\n“You’ve come to see us? What about?” cried Ilya Petrovitch. He\\nwas obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle\\nexhilarated. “If it’s on business you are rather early.[*] It’s only a\\nchance that I am here... however I’ll do what I can. I must admit, I...\\nwhat is it, what is it? Excuse me....”\\n\\n     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after\\n     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the\\n     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for\\n     coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.\\n\\n“Raskolnikov.”\\n\\n“Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten? Don’t think I\\nam like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that’s it, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Rodion Romanovitch.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I\\nmade many inquiries about you. I assure you I’ve been genuinely grieved\\nsince that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me\\nafterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and\\nso to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific\\nman does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have\\nthe greatest respect for literature, in my wife it’s a genuine passion!\\nLiterature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be\\ngained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat--well,\\nwhat does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but\\nwhat’s under the hat, what the hat covers, I can’t buy that! I was even\\nmeaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you’d... But I\\nam forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your\\nfamily have come?”\\n\\n“Yes, my mother and sister.”\\n\\n“I’ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly\\ncultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with\\nyou. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting\\nfit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!\\nI understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on\\naccount of your family’s arriving?”\\n\\n“No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find\\nZametov here.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is\\nnot here. Yes, we’ve lost Zametov. He’s not been here since yesterday...\\nhe quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a\\nfeather-headed youngster, that’s all; one might have expected something\\nfrom him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.\\nHe wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only to talk and\\nboast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it’s a very\\ndifferent matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your\\ncareer is an intellectual one and you won’t be deterred by failure. For\\nyou, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an\\nascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned\\nresearch--that’s where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....\\nHave you read Livingstone’s Travels?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,\\nand indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I\\nask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me\\nopenly, openly!”\\n\\n“N-no...”\\n\\n“Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!\\nOfficial duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say\\n_friendship_ is quite another? No, you’re wrong! It’s not friendship,\\nbut the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of\\nlove for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound\\nto feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.\\nZametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad\\nreputation, over a glass of champagne... that’s all your Zametov is good\\nfor! While I’m perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty\\nfeelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and\\nhave children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is\\nhe, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then\\nthese midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya\\nPetrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a\\nstream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He\\nlooked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.\\n\\n“I mean those crop-headed wenches,” the talkative Ilya Petrovitch\\ncontinued. “Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory\\none, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am\\nI to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!” Ilya\\nPetrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. “It’s an immoderate\\nzeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough. Why abuse\\nit? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why\\ndid he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common\\nthey are, you can’t fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill\\nthemselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard\\nabout a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what\\nwas the name of that gentleman who shot himself?”\\n\\n“Svidrigaïlov,” someone answered from the other room with drowsy\\nlistlessness.\\n\\nRaskolnikov started.\\n\\n“Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!” he cried.\\n\\n“What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?”\\n\\n“Yes... I knew him.... He hadn’t been here long.”\\n\\n“Yes, that’s so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and\\nall of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left\\nin his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his\\nfaculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, they\\nsay. How did you come to know him?”\\n\\n“I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family.”\\n\\n“Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had\\nno suspicion?”\\n\\n“I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling\\nhim.\\n\\n“You’ve turned pale again. It’s so stuffy here...”\\n\\n“Yes, I must go,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Excuse my troubling you....”\\n\\n“Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It’s a pleasure to see you and I\\nam glad to say so.”\\n\\nIlya Petrovitch held out his hand.\\n\\n“I only wanted... I came to see Zametov.”\\n\\n“I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see you.”\\n\\n“I... am very glad... good-bye,” Raskolnikov smiled.\\n\\nHe went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know\\nwhat he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself\\nwith his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed\\npast him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in\\nthe lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a\\nrolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.\\nThere, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.\\nShe looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of\\npoignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips\\nworked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned\\nand went back to the police office.\\n\\nIlya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before\\nhim stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.\\n\\n“Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? What’s the matter?”\\n\\nRaskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.\\nHe walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say\\nsomething, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.\\n\\n“You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!”\\n\\nRaskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the\\nface of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both\\nlooked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.\\n\\n“It was I...” began Raskolnikov.\\n\\n“Drink some water.”\\n\\nRaskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,\\nbut distinctly said:\\n\\n“_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with\\nan axe and robbed them._”\\n\\nIlya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.\\n\\nRaskolnikov repeated his statement.\\n\\n\\n\\nEPILOGUE\\n\\nI\\n\\nSiberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of\\nthe administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,\\nin the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-class\\nconvict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a\\nyear and a half has passed since his crime.\\n\\nThere had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered\\nexactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor\\nmisrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit\\nthe smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the\\nsecret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which\\nwas found in the murdered woman’s hand. He described minutely how he\\nhad taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its\\ncontents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta’s murder; described how\\nKoch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said\\nto one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay\\nand Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards\\ngone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the\\nVoznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.\\nThe whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the\\njudges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he\\nhad hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making\\nuse of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the\\ntrinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had\\nnever opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed\\nincredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and\\nseventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,\\nsome of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the\\ndamp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man\\nshould tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made\\na truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers\\nmore versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really\\nnot looked into the purse, and so didn’t know what was in it when he\\nhid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that\\nthe crime could only have been committed through temporary mental\\nderangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\\ngain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary\\ninsanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover\\nRaskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by\\nDr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.\\nAll this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not\\nquite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another\\nelement in the case.\\n\\nTo the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the\\ncriminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question\\nas to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he\\nanswered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was\\nhis miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to\\nprovide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand\\nroubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder\\nthrough his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by\\nprivation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he\\nanswered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost\\ncoarse....\\n\\nThe sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,\\nperhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,\\nbut had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange\\nand peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.\\nThere could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition\\nof the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he\\nhad stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his\\nabnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the\\nmurder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man\\ncommits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the\\nconfession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by\\nthe false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,\\nand when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no\\nsuspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did\\nmuch to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s\\nfavour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and\\nproved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor\\nconsumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting\\nhim for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit\\nold father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,\\nRaskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral\\nwhen he died. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they\\nhad lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two\\nlittle children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was\\ninvestigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts\\nmade an impression in his favour.\\n\\nAnd in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating\\ncircumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a\\nterm of eight years only.\\n\\nAt the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia\\nand Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the\\ntrial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so\\nas to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time\\nto see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\\nillness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial\\nderangement of her intellect.\\n\\nWhen Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she\\nhad found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening\\nRazumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s\\nquestions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her\\nmother’s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia\\non a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and\\nreputation.\\n\\nBut they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never\\nasked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the\\ncontrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she\\ntold them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting\\nthat she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya\\nhad many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be\\nin hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be\\nbrilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured\\nRazumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his\\narticle and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was\\ncontinually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed\\nwith her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was\\nobviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken\\nher suspicions.\\n\\nThey began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s strange\\nsilence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of\\ngetting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived\\non the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of\\ngreat uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother\\nsuspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was\\nafraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any\\ncase, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of\\nher faculties.\\n\\nIt happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave\\nsuch a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her\\nwithout mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and\\nsuspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood\\nlasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive\\nher and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely\\nsilent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that\\nthe poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her\\nbrother’s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her\\nsleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the\\nfatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?\\nSometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be\\nsucceeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would\\nbegin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his\\nfuture.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,\\npretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),\\nbut she still went on talking.\\n\\nFive months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin\\nand Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last\\nthe moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the\\nseparation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in\\nhis youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least\\nof a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving\\nup a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every\\nnatural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. There\\nthey would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would\\nbegin a new life. They all wept at parting.\\n\\nRaskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great\\ndeal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worried\\nso much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his\\nmother’s illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly\\nreserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by\\nSvidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the\\nparty of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word\\npassed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it\\nwould be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his\\nsister’s and Razumihin’s fervent anticipations of their happy future\\ntogether when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their\\nmother’s illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at last\\nset off.\\n\\nTwo months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet and\\nsorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.\\nDuring all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.\\nDounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she\\ncould not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.\\nAmong other things he began attending university lectures again in order\\nto take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;\\nboth counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till\\nthen they rested their hopes on Sonia.\\n\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia’s\\nmarriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more\\nmelancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how\\nRaskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father\\nand how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two\\nlittle children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria\\nAlexandrovna’s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was\\ncontinually talking about them, even entering into conversation with\\nstrangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In public\\nconveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would\\nbegin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the\\nstudent, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did\\nnot know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid\\nexcitement, there was the risk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name\\nand speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the\\naddress of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted\\non going to see her.\\n\\nAt last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes\\nbegin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One\\nmorning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,\\nthat she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must\\nexpect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,\\nbegan to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and\\nput up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and\\nhelped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual\\nfancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\\ntaken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.\\nIt was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she\\ndropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her\\nson’s terrible fate than they had supposed.\\n\\nFor a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though\\na regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached\\nSiberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month\\nto the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At\\nfirst they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on\\nthey came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for\\nfrom these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate\\nbrother’s life. Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact\\ndetail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s\\nsurroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no\\nconjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of\\nany attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the\\nsimple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,\\nwhat he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her\\nand so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The\\npicture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness\\nand precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but\\nfacts.\\n\\nBut Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,\\nespecially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not\\nready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave\\nhim from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and\\nthat when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last\\nof her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly\\naffected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although\\nhe seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off\\nfrom everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;\\nthat he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,\\nhad no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely\\nseemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he\\nhad known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his\\nwork without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent\\nabout food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that\\nat last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have\\nhis own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,\\ndeclaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote\\nfurther that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she\\nhad not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were\\ncrowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a\\nrug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that\\nhe lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply\\nfrom inattention and indifference.\\n\\nSonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,\\nhad almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and\\nrude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and\\nalmost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when\\nshe was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him\\non holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was\\nbrought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go to\\nsee him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the\\nsheds on the banks of the Irtish.\\n\\nAbout herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some\\nacquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there\\nwas scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an\\nindispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the\\nauthorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task\\nwas lightened and so on.\\n\\nAt last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and\\nuneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,\\nthat his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days\\nat a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote\\nthat he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of\\nthe hospital.\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nHe was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life, not\\nthe hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes\\nthat crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!\\nhe was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at\\nleast reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to\\nhim--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a\\nstudent he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited\\nto his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed\\nof his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?\\nSonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And yet he\\nwas ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with\\nhis contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and his\\nfetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It was\\nwounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if he\\ncould have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, even\\nshame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated\\nconscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except\\na simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just\\nbecause he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief\\nthrough some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to\\n“the idiocy” of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.\\n\\nVague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a\\ncontinual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before\\nhim. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he\\nwould only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life! What had he to\\nlive for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To live\\nin order to exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to\\ngive up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.\\nMere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted\\nmore. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he\\nhad thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.\\n\\nAnd if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that\\nwould have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the\\nawful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh, he would\\nhave been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.\\nBut he did not repent of his crime.\\n\\nAt least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he\\nhad raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.\\nBut now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his\\nactions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque\\nas they had seemed at the fatal time.\\n\\n“In what way,” he asked himself, “was my theory stupider than others\\nthat have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One has\\nonly to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced\\nby commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.\\nOh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!\\n\\n“Why does my action strike them as so horrible?” he said to himself. “Is\\nit because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at\\nrest. Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law\\nwas broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the\\nlaw... and that’s enough. Of course, in that case many of the\\nbenefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of\\ninheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. But\\nthose men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didn’t, and so I\\nhad no right to have taken that step.”\\n\\nIt was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact\\nthat he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.\\n\\nHe suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why\\nhad he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was the\\ndesire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had not\\nSvidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?\\n\\nIn misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,\\nat the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had\\nperhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and\\nhis convictions. He didn’t understand that that consciousness might be\\nthe promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future\\nresurrection.\\n\\nHe preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he\\ncould not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at\\nhis fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and\\nprized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in\\nprison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of\\nthem, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much for\\na ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away\\nin some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and\\nlonged to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the\\ngreen grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he\\nsaw still more inexplicable examples.\\n\\nIn prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not\\nwant to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome\\nand unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that\\nsurprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much\\nthat he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was\\nthe terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They\\nseemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at\\nhim with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his\\nisolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons\\nwere so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political\\nprisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as\\nignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.\\nHe saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the\\nPoles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former\\nofficer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.\\nHe was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at\\nlast--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised\\nand laughed at his crime.\\n\\n“You’re a gentleman,” they used to say. “You shouldn’t hack about with\\nan axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.”\\n\\nThe second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his\\ngang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out\\none day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.\\n\\n“You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God,” they shouted. “You ought\\nto be killed.”\\n\\nHe had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to\\nkill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at\\nhim in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;\\nhis eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard\\nsucceeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would\\nhave been bloodshed.\\n\\nThere was another question he could not decide: why were they all so\\nfond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met\\nthem, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment. And yet\\neverybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,\\nknew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no\\nparticular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents\\nof pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between\\nthem and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their\\nrelations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their\\ninstructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives\\nand sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited\\nRaskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they\\nall took off their hats to her. “Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you\\nare our dear, good little mother,” coarse branded criminals said to that\\nfrail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was\\ndelighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round\\nto watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in\\nfact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her\\nfor help in their illnesses.\\n\\nHe was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When\\nhe was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish\\nand delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a\\nterrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of\\nAsia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts\\nof microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were\\nendowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once\\nmad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual\\nand so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never\\nhad they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their\\nmoral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples\\nwent mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand\\none another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched\\nlooking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung\\nhis hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to\\nconsider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom\\nto justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They\\ngathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march\\nthe armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken\\nand the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting\\nand devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in\\nthe towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was\\nsummoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,\\nbecause everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they\\ncould not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed\\non something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something\\nquite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,\\nfought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All\\nmen and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and\\nmoved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole\\nworld. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and\\na new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these\\nmen, no one had heard their words and their voices.\\n\\nRaskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so\\nmiserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.\\nThe second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring\\ndays; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel\\npaced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during\\nhis illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was\\ndifficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially\\nin the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the\\nwindows of the ward.\\n\\nOne evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On\\nwaking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the\\ndistance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.\\nSomething stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and\\nmoved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day\\nafter; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was\\ndischarged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that\\nSofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.\\n\\nHe was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that\\nher illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,\\nSonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,\\nthat she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and\\nsee him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.\\n\\nAgain it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he\\nwent off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster\\nand where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only\\nthree of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the\\nfortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and\\nlaying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river\\nbank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the\\nwide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before\\nhim, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.\\nIn the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black\\nspecks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there other men were\\nliving, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand\\nstill, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.\\nRaskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into\\ncontemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited\\nand troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up\\nnoiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the\\nmorning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the\\ngreen shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and\\npaler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand\\nwith her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand\\nto him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would\\nrepel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always\\nseemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout\\nher visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply\\ngrieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance\\nat her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were\\nalone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.\\n\\nHow it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to\\nseize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round\\nher knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she\\nturned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same\\nmoment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her\\neyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and\\nthat at last the moment had come....\\n\\nThey wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They\\nwere both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the\\ndawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were\\nrenewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the\\nheart of the other.\\n\\nThey resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to\\nwait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before\\nthem! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his\\nbeing, while she--she only lived in his life.\\n\\nOn the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,\\nRaskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied\\nthat day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him\\ndifferently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered\\nhim in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound\\nto be so. Wasn’t everything now bound to be changed?\\n\\nHe thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her\\nand wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.\\nBut these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what\\ninfinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,\\n_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence\\nand imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an\\nexternal, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not\\nthink for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have\\nanalysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped\\ninto the place of theory and something quite different would work itself\\nout in his mind.\\n\\nUnder his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.\\nThe book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the\\nraising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry\\nhim about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with\\nbooks. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject\\nand had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it\\nhimself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without\\na word. Till now he had not opened it.\\n\\nHe did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: “Can\\nher convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at\\nleast....”\\n\\nShe too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken\\nill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was\\nalmost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! At\\nthe beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready\\nto look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not\\nknow that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would\\nhave to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great\\nsuffering.\\n\\nBut that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual\\nrenewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing\\nfrom one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.\\nThat might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is\\nended.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENT ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

The Arrest of Arsène Lupin\\n\\n\\nIt was a strange ending to a voyage that had commenced in a most\\nauspicious manner. The transatlantic steamship ‘La Provence’ was a swift\\nand comfortable vessel, under the command of a most affable man. The\\npassengers constituted a select and delightful society. The charm of\\nnew acquaintances and improvised amusements served to make the time pass\\nagreeably. We enjoyed the pleasant sensation of being separated from\\nthe world, living, as it were, upon an unknown island, and consequently\\nobliged to be sociable with each other.\\n\\nHave you ever stopped to consider how much originality and spontaneity\\nemanate from these various individuals who, on the preceding evening,\\ndid not even know each other, and who are now, for several days,\\ncondemned to lead a life of extreme intimacy, jointly defying the anger\\nof the ocean, the terrible onslaught of the waves, the violence of the\\ntempest and the agonizing monotony of the calm and sleepy water? Such\\na life becomes a sort of tragic existence, with its storms and its\\ngrandeurs, its monotony and its diversity; and that is why, perhaps,\\nwe embark upon that short voyage with mingled feelings of pleasure and\\nfear.\\n\\nBut, during the past few years, a new sensation had been added to the\\nlife of the transatlantic traveler. The little floating island is now\\nattached to the world from which it was once quite free. A bond united\\nthem, even in the very heart of the watery wastes of the Atlantic. That\\nbond is the wireless telegraph, by means of which we receive news in\\nthe most mysterious manner. We know full well that the message is not\\ntransported by the medium of a hollow wire. No, the mystery is even more\\ninexplicable, more romantic, and we must have recourse to the wings of\\nthe air in order to explain this new miracle. During the first day of\\nthe voyage, we felt that we were being followed, escorted, preceded\\neven, by that distant voice, which, from time to time, whispered to one\\nof us a few words from the receding world. Two friends spoke to me. Ten,\\ntwenty others sent gay or somber words of parting to other passengers.\\n\\nOn the second day, at a distance of five hundred miles from the French\\ncoast, in the midst of a violent storm, we received the following\\nmessage by means of the wireless telegraph:\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin is on your vessel, first cabin, blonde hair, wound right\\nfore-arm, traveling alone under name of R........”\\n\\nAt that moment, a terrible flash of lightning rent the stormy skies.\\nThe electric waves were interrupted. The remainder of the dispatch never\\nreached us. Of the name under which Arsène Lupin was concealing himself,\\nwe knew only the initial.\\n\\nIf the news had been of some other character, I have no doubt that the\\nsecret would have been carefully guarded by the telegraphic operator as\\nwell as by the officers of the vessel. But it was one of those events\\ncalculated to escape from the most rigorous discretion. The same day, no\\none knew how, the incident became a matter of current gossip and every\\npassenger was aware that the famous Arsène Lupin was hiding in our\\nmidst.\\n\\nArsène Lupin in our midst! the irresponsible burglar whose exploits\\nhad been narrated in all the newspapers during the past few months! the\\nmysterious individual with whom Ganimard, our shrewdest detective,\\nhad been engaged in an implacable conflict amidst interesting and\\npicturesque surroundings. Arsène Lupin, the eccentric gentleman who\\noperates only in the châteaux and salons, and who, one night, entered\\nthe residence of Baron Schormann, but emerged empty-handed, leaving,\\nhowever, his card on which he had scribbled these words: “Arsène Lupin,\\ngentleman-burglar, will return when the furniture is genuine.” Arsène\\nLupin, the man of a thousand disguises: in turn a chauffer, detective,\\nbookmaker, Russian physician, Spanish bull-fighter, commercial traveler,\\nrobust youth, or decrepit old man.\\n\\nThen consider this startling situation: Arsène Lupin was wandering about\\nwithin the limited bounds of a transatlantic steamer; in that very small\\ncorner of the world, in that dining saloon, in that smoking room, in\\nthat music room! Arsène Lupin was, perhaps, this gentleman.... or that\\none.... my neighbor at the table.... the sharer of my stateroom....\\n\\n“And this condition of affairs will last for five days!” exclaimed Miss\\nNelly Underdown, next morning. “It is unbearable! I hope he will be\\narrested.”\\n\\nThen, addressing me, she added:\\n\\n“And you, Monsieur d’Andrézy, you are on intimate terms with the\\ncaptain; surely you know something?”\\n\\nI should have been delighted had I possessed any information that would\\ninterest Miss Nelly. She was one of those magnificent creatures who\\ninevitably attract attention in every assembly. Wealth and beauty form\\nan irresistible combination, and Nelly possessed both.\\n\\nEducated in Paris under the care of a French mother, she was now going\\nto visit her father, the millionaire Underdown of Chicago. She was\\naccompanied by one of her friends, Lady Jerland.\\n\\nAt first, I had decided to open a flirtation with her; but, in the\\nrapidly growing intimacy of the voyage, I was soon impressed by her\\ncharming manner and my feelings became too deep and reverential for a\\nmere flirtation. Moreover, she accepted my attentions with a certain\\ndegree of favor. She condescended to laugh at my witticisms and display\\nan interest in my stories. Yet I felt that I had a rival in the person\\nof a young man with quiet and refined tastes; and it struck me, at\\ntimes, that she preferred his taciturn humor to my Parisian frivolity.\\nHe formed one in the circle of admirers that surrounded Miss Nelly\\nat the time she addressed to me the foregoing question. We were all\\ncomfortably seated in our deck-chairs. The storm of the preceding\\nevening had cleared the sky. The weather was now delightful.\\n\\n“I have no definite knowledge, mademoiselle,” I replied, “but can not\\nwe, ourselves, investigate the mystery quite as well as the detective\\nGanimard, the personal enemy of Arsène Lupin?”\\n\\n“Oh! oh! you are progressing very fast, monsieur.”\\n\\n“Not at all, mademoiselle. In the first place, let me ask, do you find\\nthe problem a complicated one?”\\n\\n“Very complicated.”\\n\\n“Have you forgotten the key we hold for the solution to the problem?”\\n\\n“What key?”\\n\\n“In the first place, Lupin calls himself Monsieur R-------.”\\n\\n“Rather vague information,” she replied.\\n\\n“Secondly, he is traveling alone.”\\n\\n“Does that help you?” she asked.\\n\\n“Thirdly, he is blonde.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Then we have only to peruse the passenger-list, and proceed by process\\nof elimination.”\\n\\nI had that list in my pocket. I took it out and glanced through it. Then\\nI remarked:\\n\\n“I find that there are only thirteen men on the passenger-list whose\\nnames begin with the letter R.”\\n\\n“Only thirteen?”\\n\\n“Yes, in the first cabin. And of those thirteen, I find that nine of\\nthem are accompanied by women, children or servants. That leaves only\\nfour who are traveling alone. First, the Marquis de Raverdan----”\\n\\n“Secretary to the American Ambassador,” interrupted Miss Nelly. “I know\\nhim.”\\n\\n“Major Rawson,” I continued.\\n\\n“He is my uncle,” some one said.\\n\\n“Mon. Rivolta.”\\n\\n“Here!” exclaimed an Italian, whose face was concealed beneath a heavy\\nblack beard.\\n\\nMiss Nelly burst into laughter, and exclaimed: “That gentleman can\\nscarcely be called a blonde.”\\n\\n“Very well, then,” I said, “we are forced to the conclusion that the\\nguilty party is the last one on the list.”\\n\\n“What is his name?”\\n\\n“Mon. Rozaine. Does anyone know him?”\\n\\nNo one answered. But Miss Nelly turned to the taciturn young man, whose\\nattentions to her had annoyed me, and said:\\n\\n“Well, Monsieur Rozaine, why do you not answer?”\\n\\nAll eyes were now turned upon him. He was a blonde. I must confess\\nthat I myself felt a shock of surprise, and the profound silence that\\nfollowed her question indicated that the others present also viewed\\nthe situation with a feeling of sudden alarm. However, the idea was an\\nabsurd one, because the gentleman in question presented an air of the\\nmost perfect innocence.\\n\\n“Why do I not answer?” he said. “Because, considering my name, my\\nposition as a solitary traveler and the color of my hair, I have already\\nreached the same conclusion, and now think that I should be arrested.”\\n\\nHe presented a strange appearance as he uttered these words. His thin\\nlips were drawn closer than usual and his face was ghastly pale, whilst\\nhis eyes were streaked with blood. Of course, he was joking, yet his\\nappearance and attitude impressed us strangely.\\n\\n“But you have not the wound?” said Miss Nelly, naively.\\n\\n“That is true,” he replied, “I lack the wound.”\\n\\nThen he pulled up his sleeve, removing his cuff, and showed us his arm.\\nBut that action did not deceive me. He had shown us his left arm, and\\nI was on the point of calling his attention to the fact, when another\\nincident diverted our attention. Lady Jerland, Miss Nelly’s friend, came\\nrunning towards us in a state of great excitement, exclaiming:\\n\\n“My jewels, my pearls! Some one has stolen them all!”\\n\\nNo, they were not all gone, as we soon found out. The thief had taken\\nonly part of them; a very curious thing. Of the diamond sunbursts,\\njeweled pendants, bracelets and necklaces, the thief had taken, not\\nthe largest but the finest and most valuable stones. The mountings were\\nlying upon the table. I saw them there, despoiled of their jewels, like\\nflowers from which the beautiful colored petals had been ruthlessly\\nplucked. And this theft must have been committed at the time Lady\\nJerland was taking her tea; in broad daylight, in a stateroom opening\\non a much frequented corridor; moreover, the thief had been obliged to\\nforce open the door of the stateroom, search for the jewel-case, which\\nwas hidden at the bottom of a hat-box, open it, select his booty and\\nremove it from the mountings.\\n\\nOf course, all the passengers instantly reached the same conclusion; it\\nwas the work of Arsène Lupin.\\n\\nThat day, at the dinner table, the seats to the right and left of\\nRozaine remained vacant; and, during the evening, it was rumored that\\nthe captain had placed him under arrest, which information produced a\\nfeeling of safety and relief. We breathed once more. That evening, we\\nresumed our games and dances. Miss Nelly, especially, displayed a spirit\\nof thoughtless gayety which convinced me that if Rozaine’s attentions\\nhad been agreeable to her in the beginning, she had already forgotten\\nthem. Her charm and good-humor completed my conquest. At midnight, under\\na bright moon, I declared my devotion with an ardor that did not seem to\\ndisplease her.\\n\\nBut, next day, to our general amazement, Rozaine was at liberty.\\nWe learned that the evidence against him was not sufficient. He had\\nproduced documents that were perfectly regular, which showed that he\\nwas the son of a wealthy merchant of Bordeaux. Besides, his arms did not\\nbear the slightest trace of a wound.\\n\\n“Documents! Certificates of birth!” exclaimed the enemies of Rozaine,\\n“of course, Arsène Lupin will furnish you as many as you desire. And as\\nto the wound, he never had it, or he has removed it.”\\n\\nThen it was proven that, at the time of the theft, Rozaine was\\npromenading on the deck. To which fact, his enemies replied that a man\\nlike Arsène Lupin could commit a crime without being actually present.\\nAnd then, apart from all other circumstances, there remained one point\\nwhich even the most skeptical could not answer: Who except Rozaine, was\\ntraveling alone, was a blonde, and bore a name beginning with R? To whom\\ndid the telegram point, if it were not Rozaine?\\n\\nAnd when Rozaine, a few minutes before breakfast, came boldly toward our\\ngroup, Miss Nelly and Lady Jerland arose and walked away.\\n\\nAn hour later, a manuscript circular was passed from hand to hand\\namongst the sailors, the stewards, and the passengers of all classes.\\nIt announced that Mon. Louis Rozaine offered a reward of ten thousand\\nfrancs for the discovery of Arsène Lupin or other person in possession\\nof the stolen jewels.\\n\\n“And if no one assists me, I will unmask the scoundrel myself,” declared\\nRozaine.\\n\\nRozaine against Arsène Lupin, or rather, according to current opinion,\\nArsène Lupin himself against Arsène Lupin; the contest promised to be\\ninteresting.\\n\\nNothing developed during the next two days. We saw Rozaine wandering\\nabout, day and night, searching, questioning, investigating. The\\ncaptain, also, displayed commendable activity. He caused the vessel to\\nbe searched from stem to stern; ransacked every stateroom under the\\nplausible theory that the jewels might be concealed anywhere, except in\\nthe thief’s own room.\\n\\n“I suppose they will find out something soon,” remarked Miss Nelly to\\nme. “He may be a wizard, but he cannot make diamonds and pearls become\\ninvisible.”\\n\\n“Certainly not,” I replied, “but he should examine the lining of our\\nhats and vests and everything we carry with us.”\\n\\nThen, exhibiting my Kodak, a 9x12 with which I had been photographing\\nher in various poses, I added: “In an apparatus no larger than that, a\\nperson could hide all of Lady Jerland’s jewels. He could pretend to take\\npictures and no one would suspect the game.”\\n\\n“But I have heard it said that every thief leaves some clue behind him.”\\n\\n“That may be generally true,” I replied, “but there is one exception:\\nArsène Lupin.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because he concentrates his thoughts not only on the theft, but on all\\nthe circumstances connected with it that could serve as a clue to his\\nidentity.”\\n\\n“A few days ago, you were more confident.”\\n\\n“Yes, but since then I have seen him at work.”\\n\\n“And what do you think about it now?” she asked.\\n\\n“Well, in my opinion, we are wasting our time.”\\n\\nAnd, as a matter of fact, the investigation had produced no result. But,\\nin the meantime, the captain’s watch had been stolen. He was furious. He\\nquickened his efforts and watched Rozaine more closely than before. But,\\non the following day, the watch was found in the second officer’s collar\\nbox.\\n\\nThis incident caused considerable astonishment, and displayed the\\nhumorous side of Arsène Lupin, burglar though he was, but dilettante as\\nwell. He combined business with pleasure. He reminded us of the\\nauthor who almost died in a fit of laughter provoked by his own play.\\nCertainly, he was an artist in his particular line of work, and whenever\\nI saw Rozaine, gloomy and reserved, and thought of the double role that\\nhe was playing, I accorded him a certain measure of admiration.\\n\\nOn the following evening, the officer on deck duty heard groans\\nemanating from the darkest corner of the ship. He approached and found a\\nman lying there, his head enveloped in a thick gray scarf and his hands\\ntied together with a heavy cord. It was Rozaine. He had been assaulted,\\nthrown down and robbed. A card, pinned to his coat, bore these words:\\n“Arsène Lupin accepts with pleasure the ten thousand francs offered by\\nMon. Rozaine.” As a matter of fact, the stolen pocket-book contained\\ntwenty thousand francs.\\n\\nOf course, some accused the unfortunate man of having simulated this\\nattack on himself. But, apart from the fact that he could not have bound\\nhimself in that manner, it was established that the writing on the\\ncard was entirely different from that of Rozaine, but, on the contrary,\\nresembled the handwriting of Arsène Lupin as it was reproduced in an old\\nnewspaper found on board.\\n\\nThus it appeared that Rozaine was not Arsène Lupin; but was Rozaine, the\\nson of a Bordeaux merchant. And the presence of Arsène Lupin was once\\nmore affirmed, and that in a most alarming manner.\\n\\nSuch was the state of terror amongst the passengers that none would\\nremain alone in a stateroom or wander singly in unfrequented parts of\\nthe vessel. We clung together as a matter of safety. And yet the most\\nintimate acquaintances were estranged by a mutual feeling of distrust.\\nArsène Lupin was, now, anybody and everybody. Our excited imaginations\\nattributed to him miraculous and unlimited power. We supposed him\\ncapable of assuming the most unexpected disguises; of being, by turns,\\nthe highly respectable Major Rawson or the noble Marquis de Raverdan,\\nor even--for we no longer stopped with the accusing letter of R--or even\\nsuch or such a person well known to all of us, and having wife, children\\nand servants.\\n\\nThe first wireless dispatches from America brought no news; at\\nleast, the captain did not communicate any to us. The silence was not\\nreassuring.\\n\\nOur last day on the steamer seemed interminable. We lived in constant\\nfear of some disaster. This time, it would not be a simple theft or a\\ncomparatively harmless assault; it would be a crime, a murder. No one\\nimagined that Arsène Lupin would confine himself to those two trifling\\noffenses. Absolute master of the ship, the authorities powerless, he\\ncould do whatever he pleased; our property and lives were at his mercy.\\n\\nYet those were delightful hours for me, since they secured to me the\\nconfidence of Miss Nelly. Deeply moved by those startling events and\\nbeing of a highly nervous nature, she spontaneously sought at my side\\na protection and security that I was pleased to give her. Inwardly, I\\nblessed Arsène Lupin. Had he not been the means of bringing me and\\nMiss Nelly closer to each other? Thanks to him, I could now indulge in\\ndelicious dreams of love and happiness--dreams that, I felt, were not\\nunwelcome to Miss Nelly. Her smiling eyes authorized me to make them;\\nthe softness of her voice bade me hope.\\n\\nAs we approached the American shore, the active search for the thief was\\napparently abandoned, and we were anxiously awaiting the supreme moment\\nin which the mysterious enigma would be explained. Who was Arsène\\nLupin? Under what name, under what disguise was the famous Arsène Lupin\\nconcealing himself? And, at last, that supreme moment arrived. If I live\\none hundred years, I shall not forget the slightest details of it.\\n\\n“How pale you are, Miss Nelly,” I said to my companion, as she leaned\\nupon my arm, almost fainting.\\n\\n“And you!” she replied, “ah! you are so changed.”\\n\\n“Just think! this is a most exciting moment, and I am delighted to\\nspend it with you, Miss Nelly. I hope that your memory will sometimes\\nrevert---”\\n\\nBut she was not listening. She was nervous and excited. The gangway was\\nplaced in position, but, before we could use it, the uniformed customs\\nofficers came on board. Miss Nelly murmured:\\n\\n“I shouldn’t be surprised to hear that Arsène Lupin escaped from the\\nvessel during the voyage.”\\n\\n“Perhaps he preferred death to dishonor, and plunged into the Atlantic\\nrather than be arrested.”\\n\\n“Oh, do not laugh,” she said.\\n\\nSuddenly I started, and, in answer to her question, I said:\\n\\n“Do you see that little old man standing at the bottom of the gangway?”\\n\\n“With an umbrella and an olive-green coat?”\\n\\n“It is Ganimard.”\\n\\n“Ganimard?”\\n\\n“Yes, the celebrated detective who has sworn to capture Arsène Lupin.\\nAh! I can understand now why we did not receive any news from this side\\nof the Atlantic. Ganimard was here! and he always keeps his business\\nsecret.”\\n\\n“Then you think he will arrest Arsène Lupin?”\\n\\n“Who can tell? The unexpected always happens when Arsène Lupin is\\nconcerned in the affair.”\\n\\n“Oh!” she exclaimed, with that morbid curiosity peculiar to women, “I\\nshould like to see him arrested.”\\n\\n“You will have to be patient. No doubt, Arsène Lupin has already seen\\nhis enemy and will not be in a hurry to leave the steamer.”\\n\\nThe passengers were now leaving the steamer. Leaning on his umbrella,\\nwith an air of careless indifference, Ganimard appeared to be paying no\\nattention to the crowd that was hurrying down the gangway. The Marquis\\nde Raverdan, Major Rawson, the Italian Rivolta, and many others had\\nalready left the vessel before Rozaine appeared. Poor Rozaine!\\n\\n“Perhaps it is he, after all,” said Miss Nelly to me. “What do you\\nthink?”\\n\\n“I think it would be very interesting to have Ganimard and Rozaine in\\nthe same picture. You take the camera. I am loaded down.”\\n\\nI gave her the camera, but too late for her to use it. Rozaine was\\nalready passing the detective. An American officer, standing behind\\nGanimard, leaned forward and whispered in his ear. The French detective\\nshrugged his shoulders and Rozaine passed on. Then, my God, who was\\nArsène Lupin?\\n\\n“Yes,” said Miss Nelly, aloud, “who can it be?”\\n\\nNot more than twenty people now remained on board. She scrutinized them\\none by one, fearful that Arsène Lupin was not amongst them.\\n\\n“We cannot wait much longer,” I said to her.\\n\\nShe started toward the gangway. I followed. But we had not taken ten\\nsteps when Ganimard barred our passage.\\n\\n“Well, what is it?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“One moment, monsieur. What’s your hurry?”\\n\\n“I am escorting mademoiselle.”\\n\\n“One moment,” he repeated, in a tone of authority. Then, gazing into my\\neyes, he said:\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin, is it not?”\\n\\nI laughed, and replied: “No, simply Bernard d’Andrézy.”\\n\\n“Bernard d’Andrézy died in Macedonia three years ago.”\\n\\n“If Bernard d’Andrézy were dead, I should not be here. But you are\\nmistaken. Here are my papers.”\\n\\n“They are his; and I can tell you exactly how they came into your\\npossession.”\\n\\n“You are a fool!” I exclaimed. “Arsène Lupin sailed under the name of\\nR---”\\n\\n“Yes, another of your tricks; a false scent that deceived them at Havre.\\nYou play a good game, my boy, but this time luck is against you.”\\n\\nI hesitated a moment. Then he hit me a sharp blow on the right arm,\\nwhich caused me to utter a cry of pain. He had struck the wound, yet\\nunhealed, referred to in the telegram.\\n\\nI was obliged to surrender. There was no alternative. I turned to Miss\\nNelly, who had heard everything. Our eyes met; then she glanced at the\\nKodak I had placed in her hands, and made a gesture that conveyed to me\\nthe impression that she understood everything. Yes, there, between the\\nnarrow folds of black leather, in the hollow centre of the small object\\nthat I had taken the precaution to place in her hands before Ganimard\\narrested me, it was there I had deposited Rozaine’s twenty thousand\\nfrancs and Lady Jerland’s pearls and diamonds.\\n\\nOh! I pledge my oath that, at that solemn moment, when I was in the\\ngrasp of Ganimard and his two assistants, I was perfectly indifferent to\\neverything, to my arrest, the hostility of the people, everything\\nexcept this one question: what will Miss Nelly do with the things I had\\nconfided to her?\\n\\nIn the absence of that material and conclusive proof, I had nothing\\nto fear; but would Miss Nelly decide to furnish that proof? Would she\\nbetray me? Would she act the part of an enemy who cannot forgive, or\\nthat of a woman whose scorn is softened by feelings of indulgence and\\ninvoluntary sympathy?\\n\\nShe passed in front of me. I said nothing, but bowed very low. Mingled\\nwith the other passengers, she advanced to the gangway with my Kodak\\nin her hand. It occurred to me that she would not dare to expose me\\npublicly, but she might do so when she reached a more private place.\\nHowever, when she had passed only a few feet down the gangway, with\\na movement of simulated awkwardness, she let the camera fall into the\\nwater between the vessel and the pier. Then she walked down the gangway,\\nand was quickly lost to sight in the crowd. She had passed out of my\\nlife forever.\\n\\nFor a moment, I stood motionless. Then, to Ganimard’s great\\nastonishment, I muttered:\\n\\n“What a pity that I am not an honest man!”\\n\\nSuch was the story of his arrest as narrated to me by Arsène Lupin\\nhimself. The various incidents, which I shall record in writing at a\\nlater day, have established between us certain ties.... shall I say of\\nfriendship? Yes, I venture to believe that Arsène Lupin honors me with\\nhis friendship, and that it is through friendship that he occasionally\\ncalls on me, and brings, into the silence of my library, his youthful\\nexuberance of spirits, the contagion of his enthusiasm, and the mirth of\\na man for whom destiny has naught but favors and smiles.\\n\\nHis portrait? How can I describe him? I have seen him twenty times and\\neach time he was a different person; even he himself said to me on one\\noccasion: “I no longer know who I am. I cannot recognize myself in the\\nmirror.” Certainly, he was a great actor, and possessed a marvelous\\nfaculty for disguising himself. Without the slightest effort, he could\\nadopt the voice, gestures and mannerisms of another person.\\n\\n“Why,” said he, “why should I retain a definite form and feature? Why\\nnot avoid the danger of a personality that is ever the same? My actions\\nwill serve to identify me.”\\n\\nThen he added, with a touch of pride:\\n\\n“So much the better if no one can ever say with absolute certainty:\\nThere is Arsène Lupin! The essential point is that the public may be\\nable to refer to my work and say, without fear of mistake: Arsène Lupin\\ndid that!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII. Arsène Lupin in Prison\\n\\n\\nThere is no tourist worthy of the name who does not know the banks of\\nthe Seine, and has not noticed, in passing, the little feudal castle of\\nthe Malaquis, built upon a rock in the centre of the river. An arched\\nbridge connects it with the shore. All around it, the calm waters of the\\ngreat river play peacefully amongst the reeds, and the wagtails flutter\\nover the moist crests of the stones.\\n\\nThe history of the Malaquis castle is stormy like its name, harsh like\\nits outlines. It has passed through a long series of combats, sieges,\\nassaults, rapines and massacres. A recital of the crimes that have been\\ncommitted there would cause the stoutest heart to tremble. There are\\nmany mysterious legends connected with the castle, and they tell us of\\na famous subterranean tunnel that formerly led to the abbey of Jumieges\\nand to the manor of Agnes Sorel, mistress of Charles VII.\\n\\nIn that ancient habitation of heroes and brigands, the Baron Nathan\\nCahorn now lived; or Baron Satan as he was formerly called on the\\nBourse, where he had acquired a fortune with incredible rapidity. The\\nlords of Malaquis, absolutely ruined, had been obliged to sell\\nthe ancient castle at a great sacrifice. It contained an admirable\\ncollection of furniture, pictures, wood carvings, and faience. The Baron\\nlived there alone, attended by three old servants. No one ever enters\\nthe place. No one had ever beheld the three Rubens that he possessed,\\nhis two Watteau, his Jean Goujon pulpit, and the many other treasures\\nthat he had acquired by a vast expenditure of money at public sales.\\n\\nBaron Satan lived in constant fear, not for himself, but for the\\ntreasures that he had accumulated with such an earnest devotion and with\\nso much perspicacity that the shrewdest merchant could not say that\\nthe Baron had ever erred in his taste or judgment. He loved them--his\\nbibelots. He loved them intensely, like a miser; jealously, like a\\nlover. Every day, at sunset, the iron gates at either end of the bridge\\nand at the entrance to the court of honor are closed and barred. At\\nthe least touch on these gates, electric bells will ring throughout the\\ncastle.\\n\\nOne Thursday in September, a letter-carrier presented himself at the\\ngate at the head of the bridge, and, as usual, it was the Baron himself\\nwho partially opened the heavy portal. He scrutinized the man as\\nminutely as if he were a stranger, although the honest face and\\ntwinkling eyes of the postman had been familiar to the Baron for many\\nyears. The man laughed, as he said:\\n\\n“It is only I, Monsieur le Baron. It is not another man wearing my cap\\nand blouse.”\\n\\n“One can never tell,” muttered the Baron.\\n\\nThe man handed him a number of newspapers, and then said:\\n\\n“And now, Monsieur le Baron, here is something new.”\\n\\n“Something new?”\\n\\n“Yes, a letter. A registered letter.”\\n\\nLiving as a recluse, without friends or business relations, the baron\\nnever received any letters, and the one now presented to him immediately\\naroused within him a feeling of suspicion and distrust. It was like an\\nevil omen. Who was this mysterious correspondent that dared to disturb\\nthe tranquility of his retreat?\\n\\n“You must sign for it, Monsieur le Baron.”\\n\\nHe signed; then took the letter, waited until the postman had\\ndisappeared beyond the bend in the road, and, after walking nervously to\\nand fro for a few minutes, he leaned against the parapet of the bridge\\nand opened the envelope. It contained a sheet of paper, bearing this\\nheading: Prison de la Santé, Paris. He looked at the signature: _Arsène\\nLupin_. Then he read:\\n\\n  “Monsieur le Baron:\\n\\n  “There is, in the gallery in your castle, a picture of Philippe\\n  de Champaigne, of exquisite finish, which pleases me beyond\\n  measure. Your Rubens are also to my taste, as well as your\\n  smallest Watteau. In the salon to the right, I have noticed the\\n  Louis XIII cadence-table, the tapestries of Beauvais, the Empire\\n  gueridon signed ‘Jacob,’ and the Renaissance chest. In the salon\\n  to the left, all the cabinet full of jewels and miniatures.\\n\\n  “For the present, I will content myself with those articles that\\n  can be conveniently removed. I will therefore ask you to pack\\n  them carefully and ship them to me, charges prepaid, to the\\n  station at Batignolles, within eight days, otherwise I shall be\\n  obliged to remove them myself during the night of 27 September;\\n  but, under those circumstances, I shall not content myself with\\n  the articles above mentioned.\\n\\n  “Accept my apologies for any inconvenience I may cause you, and\\n  believe me to be your humble servant,\\n\\n                                            “Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\n  “P. S.--Please do not send the largest Watteau. Although you\\n  paid thirty thousand francs for it, it is only a copy, the\\n  original having been burned, under the Directoire by Barras,\\n  during a night of debauchery. Consult the memoirs of Garat.\\n\\n  “I do not care for the Louis XV chatelaine, as I doubt its\\n  authenticity.”\\n\\nThat letter completely upset the baron. Had it borne any other\\nsignature, he would have been greatly alarmed--but signed by Arsène\\nLupin!\\n\\nAs an habitual reader of the newspapers, he was versed in the history\\nof recent crimes, and was therefore well acquainted with the exploits of\\nthe mysterious burglar. Of course, he knew that Lupin had been arrested\\nin America by his enemy Ganimard and was at present incarcerated in the\\nPrison de la Santé. But he knew also that any miracle might be expected\\nfrom Arsène Lupin. Moreover, that exact knowledge of the castle, the\\nlocation of the pictures and furniture, gave the affair an alarming\\naspect. How could he have acquired that information concerning things\\nthat no one had ever seen?\\n\\nThe baron raised his eyes and contemplated the stern outlines of the\\ncastle, its steep rocky pedestal, the depth of the surrounding water,\\nand shrugged his shoulders. Certainly, there was no danger. No one in\\nthe world could force an entrance to the sanctuary that contained his\\npriceless treasures.\\n\\nNo one, perhaps, but Arsène Lupin! For him, gates, walls and drawbridges\\ndid not exist. What use were the most formidable obstacles or the most\\ncareful precautions, if Arsène Lupin had decided to effect an entrance?\\n\\nThat evening, he wrote to the Procurer of the Republique at Rouen. He\\nenclosed the threatening letter and solicited aid and protection.\\n\\nThe reply came at once to the effect that Arsène Lupin was in custody in\\nthe Prison de la Santé, under close surveillance, with no opportunity\\nto write such a letter, which was, no doubt, the work of some imposter.\\nBut, as an act of precaution, the Procurer had submitted the letter\\nto an expert in handwriting, who declared that, in spite of certain\\nresemblances, the writing was not that of the prisoner.\\n\\nBut the words “in spite of certain resemblances” caught the attention of\\nthe baron; in them, he read the possibility of a doubt which appeared to\\nhim quite sufficient to warrant the intervention of the law. His fears\\nincreased. He read Lupin’s letter over and over again. “I shall be\\nobliged to remove them myself.” And then there was the fixed date: the\\nnight of 27 September.\\n\\nTo confide in his servants was a proceeding repugnant to his nature; but\\nnow, for the first time in many years, he experienced the necessity of\\nseeking counsel with some one. Abandoned by the legal official of\\nhis own district, and feeling unable to defend himself with his own\\nresources, he was on the point of going to Paris to engage the services\\nof a detective.\\n\\nTwo days passed; on the third day, he was filled with hope and joy as\\nhe read the following item in the ‘Reveil de Caudebec’, a newspaper\\npublished in a neighboring town:\\n\\n“We have the pleasure of entertaining in our city, at the present time,\\nthe veteran detective Mon. Ganimard who acquired a world-wide reputation\\nby his clever capture of Arsène Lupin. He has come here for rest and\\nrecreation, and, being an enthusiastic fisherman, he threatens to\\ncapture all the fish in our river.”\\n\\nGanimard! Ah, here is the assistance desired by Baron Cahorn! Who could\\nbaffle the schemes of Arsène Lupin better than Ganimard, the patient and\\nastute detective? He was the man for the place.\\n\\nThe baron did not hesitate. The town of Caudebec was only six kilometers\\nfrom the castle, a short distance to a man whose step was accelerated by\\nthe hope of safety.\\n\\nAfter several fruitless attempts to ascertain the detective’s address,\\nthe baron visited the office of the ‘Reveil,’ situated on the quai.\\nThere he found the writer of the article who, approaching the window,\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n“Ganimard? Why, you are sure to see him somewhere on the quai with his\\nfishing-pole. I met him there and chanced to read his name engraved on\\nhis rod. Ah, there he is now, under the trees.”\\n\\n“That little man, wearing a straw hat?”\\n\\n“Exactly. He is a gruff fellow, with little to say.”\\n\\nFive minutes later, the baron approached the celebrated Ganimard,\\nintroduced himself, and sought to commence a conversation, but that\\nwas a failure. Then he broached the real object of his interview,\\nand briefly stated his case. The other listened, motionless, with his\\nattention riveted on his fishing-rod. When the baron had finished his\\nstory, the fisherman turned, with an air of profound pity, and said:\\n\\n“Monsieur, it is not customary for thieves to warn people they are about\\nto rob. Arsène Lupin, especially, would not commit such a folly.”\\n\\n“But---”\\n\\n“Monsieur, if I had the least doubt, believe me, the pleasure of\\nagain capturing Arsène Lupin would place me at your disposal. But,\\nunfortunately, that young man is already under lock and key.”\\n\\n“He may have escaped.”\\n\\n“No one ever escaped from the Santé.”\\n\\n“But, he---”\\n\\n“He, no more than any other.”\\n\\n“Yet---”\\n\\n“Well, if he escapes, so much the better. I will catch him again.\\nMeanwhile, you go home and sleep soundly. That will do for the present.\\nYou frighten the fish.”\\n\\nThe conversation was ended. The baron returned to the castle, reassured\\nto some extent by Ganimard’s indifference. He examined the bolts,\\nwatched the servants, and, during the next forty-eight hours, he became\\nalmost persuaded that his fears were groundless. Certainly, as Ganimard\\nhad said, thieves do not warn people they are about to rob.\\n\\nThe fateful day was close at hand. It was now the twenty-sixth of\\nSeptember and nothing had happened. But at three o’clock the bell rang.\\nA boy brought this telegram:\\n\\n“No goods at Batignolles station. Prepare everything for tomorrow night.\\nArsène.”\\n\\nThis telegram threw the baron into such a state of excitement that he\\neven considered the advisability of yielding to Lupin’s demands.\\n\\nHowever, he hastened to Caudebec. Ganimard was fishing at the same\\nplace, seated on a campstool. Without a word, he handed him the\\ntelegram.\\n\\n“Well, what of it?” said the detective.\\n\\n“What of it? But it is tomorrow.”\\n\\n“What is tomorrow?”\\n\\n“The robbery! The pillage of my collections!”\\n\\nGanimard laid down his fishing-rod, turned to the baron, and exclaimed,\\nin a tone of impatience:\\n\\n“Ah! Do you think I am going to bother myself about such a silly story\\nas that!”\\n\\n“How much do you ask to pass tomorrow night in the castle?”\\n\\n“Not a sou. Now, leave me alone.”\\n\\n“Name your own price. I am rich and can pay it.”\\n\\nThis offer disconcerted Ganimard, who replied, calmly:\\n\\n“I am here on a vacation. I have no right to undertake such work.”\\n\\n“No one will know. I promise to keep it secret.”\\n\\n“Oh! nothing will happen.”\\n\\n“Come! three thousand francs. Will that be enough?”\\n\\nThe detective, after a moment’s reflection, said:\\n\\n“Very well. But I must warn you that you are throwing your money out of\\nthe window.”\\n\\n“I do not care.”\\n\\n“In that case... but, after all, what do we know about this devil Lupin!\\nHe may have quite a numerous band of robbers with him. Are you sure of\\nyour servants?”\\n\\n“My faith---”\\n\\n“Better not count on them. I will telegraph for two of my men to help\\nme. And now, go! It is better for us not to be seen together. Tomorrow\\nevening about nine o’clock.”\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nThe following day--the date fixed by Arsène Lupin--Baron Cahorn arranged\\nall his panoply of war, furbished his weapons, and, like a sentinel,\\npaced to and fro in front of the castle. He saw nothing, heard nothing.\\nAt half-past eight o’clock in the evening, he dismissed his servants.\\nThey occupied rooms in a wing of the building, in a retired spot, well\\nremoved from the main portion of the castle. Shortly thereafter, the\\nbaron heard the sound of approaching footsteps. It was Ganimard and his\\ntwo assistants--great, powerful fellows with immense hands, and necks\\nlike bulls. After asking a few questions relating to the location of the\\nvarious entrances and rooms, Ganimard carefully closed and barricaded\\nall the doors and windows through which one could gain access to the\\nthreatened rooms. He inspected the walls, raised the tapestries, and\\nfinally installed his assistants in the central gallery which was\\nlocated between the two salons.\\n\\n“No nonsense! We are not here to sleep. At the slightest sound, open the\\nwindows of the court and call me. Pay attention also to the water-side.\\nTen metres of perpendicular rock is no obstacle to those devils.”\\n\\nGanimard locked his assistants in the gallery, carried away the keys,\\nand said to the baron:\\n\\n“And now, to our post.”\\n\\nHe had chosen for himself a small room located in the thick outer wall,\\nbetween the two principal doors, and which, in former years, had been\\nthe watchman’s quarters. A peep-hole opened upon the bridge; another on\\nthe court. In one corner, there was an opening to a tunnel.\\n\\n“I believe you told me, Monsieur le Baron, that this tunnel is the only\\nsubterranean entrance to the castle and that it has been closed up for\\ntime immemorial?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Then, unless there is some other entrance, known only to Arsène Lupin,\\nwe are quite safe.”\\n\\nHe placed three chairs together, stretched himself upon them, lighted\\nhis pipe and sighed:\\n\\n“Really, Monsieur le Baron, I feel ashamed to accept your money for such\\na sinecure as this. I will tell the story to my friend Lupin. He will\\nenjoy it immensely.”\\n\\nThe baron did not laugh. He was anxiously listening, but heard nothing\\nsave the beating of his own heart. From time to time, he leaned over the\\ntunnel and cast a fearful eye into its depths. He heard the clock strike\\neleven, twelve, one.\\n\\nSuddenly, he seized Ganimard’s arm. The latter leaped up, awakened from\\nhis sleep.\\n\\n“Do you hear?” asked the baron, in a whisper.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“I was snoring, I suppose.”\\n\\n“No, no, listen.”\\n\\n“Ah! yes, it is the horn of an automobile.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Well! it is very improbable that Lupin would use an automobile like a\\nbattering-ram to demolish your castle. Come, Monsieur le Baron, return\\nto your post. I am going to sleep. Good-night.”\\n\\nThat was the only alarm. Ganimard resumed his interrupted slumbers, and\\nthe baron heard nothing except the regular snoring of his companion. At\\nbreak of day, they left the room. The castle was enveloped in a profound\\ncalm; it was a peaceful dawn on the bosom of a tranquil river. They\\nmounted the stairs, Cahorn radiant with joy, Ganimard calm as usual.\\nThey heard no sound; they saw nothing to arouse suspicion.\\n\\n“What did I tell you, Monsieur le Baron? Really, I should not have\\naccepted your offer. I am ashamed.”\\n\\nHe unlocked the door and entered the gallery. Upon two chairs, with\\ndrooping heads and pendent arms, the detective’s two assistants were\\nasleep.\\n\\n“Tonnerre de nom d’un chien!” exclaimed Ganimard. At the same moment,\\nthe baron cried out:\\n\\n“The pictures! The credence!”\\n\\nHe stammered, choked, with arms outstretched toward the empty places,\\ntoward the denuded walls where naught remained but the useless nails\\nand cords. The Watteau, disappeared! The Rubens, carried away! The\\ntapestries taken down! The cabinets, despoiled of their jewels!\\n\\n“And my Louis XVI candelabra! And the Regent chandelier!...And my\\ntwelfth-century Virgin!”\\n\\nHe ran from one spot to another in wildest despair. He recalled the\\npurchase price of each article, added up the figures, counted his\\nlosses, pell-mell, in confused words and unfinished phrases. He stamped\\nwith rage; he groaned with grief. He acted like a ruined man whose only\\nhope is suicide.\\n\\nIf anything could have consoled him, it would have been the stupefaction\\ndisplayed by Ganimard. The famous detective did not move. He appeared\\nto be petrified; he examined the room in a listless manner. The\\nwindows?.... closed. The locks on the doors?.... intact. Not a break in\\nthe ceiling; not a hole in the floor. Everything was in perfect order.\\nThe theft had been carried out methodically, according to a logical and\\ninexorable plan.\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin....Arsène Lupin,” he muttered.\\n\\nSuddenly, as if moved by anger, he rushed upon his two assistants and\\nshook them violently. They did not awaken.\\n\\n“The devil!” he cried. “Can it be possible?”\\n\\nHe leaned over them and, in turn, examined them closely. They were\\nasleep; but their response was unnatural.\\n\\n“They have been drugged,” he said to the baron.\\n\\n“By whom?”\\n\\n“By him, of course, or his men under his discretion. That work bears his\\nstamp.”\\n\\n“In that case, I am lost--nothing can be done.”\\n\\n“Nothing,” assented Ganimard.\\n\\n“It is dreadful; it is monstrous.”\\n\\n“Lodge a complaint.”\\n\\n“What good will that do?”\\n\\n“Oh; it is well to try it. The law has some resources.”\\n\\n“The law! Bah! it is useless. You represent the law, and, at this\\nmoment, when you should be looking for a clue and trying to discover\\nsomething, you do not even stir.”\\n\\n“Discover something with Arsène Lupin! Why, my dear monsieur, Arsène\\nLupin never leaves any clue behind him. He leaves nothing to chance.\\nSometimes I think he put himself in my way and simply allowed me to\\narrest him in America.”\\n\\n“Then, I must renounce my pictures! He has taken the gems of my\\ncollection. I would give a fortune to recover them. If there is no other\\nway, let him name his own price.”\\n\\nGanimard regarded the baron attentively, as he said:\\n\\n“Now, that is sensible. Will you stick to it?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes. But why?”\\n\\n“An idea that I have.”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“We will discuss it later--if the official examination does not succeed.\\nBut, not one word about me, if you wish my assistance.”\\n\\nHe added, between his teeth:\\n\\n“It is true I have nothing to boast of in this affair.”\\n\\nThe assistants were gradually regaining consciousness with the\\nbewildered air of people who come out of an hypnotic sleep. They opened\\ntheir eyes and looked about them in astonishment. Ganimard questioned\\nthem; they remembered nothing.\\n\\n“But you must have seen some one?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Can’t you remember?”\\n\\n“No, no.”\\n\\n“Did you drink anything?”\\n\\nThey considered a moment, and then one of them replied:\\n\\n“Yes, I drank a little water.”\\n\\n“Out of that carafe?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“So did I,” declared the other.\\n\\nGanimard smelled and tasted it. It had no particular taste and no odor.\\n\\n“Come,” he said, “we are wasting our time here. One can’t decide an\\nArsène Lupin problem in five minutes. But, morbleau! I swear I will\\ncatch him again.”\\n\\nThe same day, a charge of burglary was duly performed by Baron Cahorn\\nagainst Arsène Lupin, a prisoner in the Prison de la Santé.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nThe baron afterwards regretted making the charge against Lupin when he\\nsaw his castle delivered over to the gendarmes, the procureur, the judge\\nd’instruction, the newspaper reporters and photographers, and a throng\\nof idle curiosity-seekers.\\n\\nThe affair soon became a topic of general discussion, and the name of\\nArsène Lupin excited the public imagination to such an extent that the\\nnewspapers filled their columns with the most fantastic stories of his\\nexploits which found ready credence amongst their readers.\\n\\nBut the letter of Arsène Lupin that was published in the _Echo de\\nFrance_ (no once ever knew how the newspaper obtained it), that letter\\nin which Baron Cahorn was impudently warned of the coming theft, caused\\nconsiderable excitement. The most fabulous theories were advanced. Some\\nrecalled the existence of the famous subterranean tunnels, and that was\\nthe line of research pursued by the officers of the law, who searched\\nthe house from top to bottom, questioned every stone, studied the\\nwainscoting and the chimneys, the window-frames and the girders in the\\nceilings. By the light of torches, they examined the immense cellars\\nwhere the lords of Malaquis were wont to store their munitions and\\nprovisions. They sounded the rocky foundation to its very centre. But it\\nwas all in vain. They discovered no trace of a subterranean tunnel. No\\nsecret passage existed.\\n\\nBut the eager public declared that the pictures and furniture could not\\nvanish like so many ghosts. They are substantial, material things and\\nrequire doors and windows for their exits and their entrances, and so\\ndo the people that remove them. Who were those people? How did they gain\\naccess to the castle? And how did they leave it?\\n\\nThe police officers of Rouen, convinced of their own impotence,\\nsolicited the assistance of the Parisian detective force. Mon. Dudouis,\\nchief of the Sûreté, sent the best sleuths of the iron brigade. He\\nhimself spent forty-eight hours at the castle, but met with no success.\\nThen he sent for Ganimard, whose past services had proved so useful when\\nall else failed.\\n\\nGanimard listened, in silence, to the instructions of his superior;\\nthen, shaking his head, he said:\\n\\n“In my opinion, it is useless to ransack the castle. The solution of the\\nproblem lies elsewhere.”\\n\\n“Where, then?”\\n\\n“With Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\n“With Arsène Lupin! To support that theory, we must admit his\\nintervention.”\\n\\n“I do admit it. In fact, I consider it quite certain.”\\n\\n“Come, Ganimard, that is absurd. Arsène Lupin is in prison.”\\n\\n“I grant you that Arsène Lupin is in prison, closely guarded; but he\\nmust have fetters on his feet, manacles on his wrists, and gag in his\\nmouth before I change my opinion.”\\n\\n“Why so obstinate, Ganimard?”\\n\\n“Because Arsène Lupin is the only man in France of sufficient calibre to\\ninvent and carry out a scheme of that magnitude.”\\n\\n“Mere words, Ganimard.”\\n\\n“But true ones. Look! What are they doing? Searching for subterranean\\npassages, stones swinging on pivots, and other nonsense of that kind.\\nBut Lupin doesn’t employ such old-fashioned methods. He is a modern\\ncracksman, right up to date.”\\n\\n“And how would you proceed?”\\n\\n“I should ask your permission to spend an hour with him.”\\n\\n“In his cell?”\\n\\n“Yes. During the return trip from America we became very friendly, and\\nI venture to say that if he can give me any information without\\ncompromising himself he will not hesitate to save me from incurring\\nuseless trouble.”\\n\\nIt was shortly after noon when Ganimard entered the cell of Arsène\\nLupin. The latter, who was lying on his bed, raised his head and uttered\\na cry of apparent joy.\\n\\n“Ah! This is a real surprise. My dear Ganimard, here!”\\n\\n“Ganimard himself.”\\n\\n“In my chosen retreat, I have felt a desire for many things, but my\\nfondest wish was to receive you here.”\\n\\n“Very kind of you, I am sure.”\\n\\n“Not at all. You know I hold you in the highest regard.”\\n\\n“I am proud of it.”\\n\\n“I have always said: Ganimard is our best detective. He is almost,--you\\nsee how candid I am!--he is almost as clever as Sherlock Holmes. But I\\nam sorry that I cannot offer you anything better than this hard stool.\\nAnd no refreshments! Not even a glass of beer! Of course, you will\\nexcuse me, as I am here only temporarily.”\\n\\nGanimard smiled, and accepted the proffered seat. Then the prisoner\\ncontinued:\\n\\n“Mon Dieu, how pleased I am to see the face of an honest man. I am so\\ntired of those devils of spies who come here ten times a day to ransack\\nmy pockets and my cell to satisfy themselves that I am not preparing to\\nescape. The government is very solicitous on my account.”\\n\\n“It is quite right.”\\n\\n“Why so? I should be quite contented if they would allow me to live in\\nmy own quiet way.”\\n\\n“On other people’s money.”\\n\\n“Quite so. That would be so simple. But here, I am joking, and you are,\\nno doubt, in a hurry. So let us come to business, Ganimard. To what do I\\nowe the honor of this visit?\\n\\n“The Cahorn affair,” declared Ganimard, frankly.\\n\\n“Ah! Wait, one moment. You see I have had so many affairs! First, let me\\nfix in my mind the circumstances of this particular case....Ah! yes, now\\nI have it. The Cahorn affair, Malaquis castle, Seine-Inférieure....Two\\nRubens, a Watteau, and a few trifling articles.”\\n\\n“Trifling!”\\n\\n“Oh! ma foi, all that is of slight importance. But it suffices to know\\nthat the affair interests you. How can I serve you, Ganimard?”\\n\\n“Must I explain to you what steps the authorities have taken in the\\nmatter?”\\n\\n“Not at all. I have read the newspapers and I will frankly state that\\nyou have made very little progress.”\\n\\n“And that is the reason I have come to see you.”\\n\\n“I am entirely at your service.”\\n\\n“In the first place, the Cahorn affair was managed by you?”\\n\\n“From A to Z.”\\n\\n“The letter of warning? the telegram?”\\n\\n“All mine. I ought to have the receipts somewhere.”\\n\\nArsène opened the drawer of a small table of plain white wood which,\\nwith the bed and stool, constituted all the furniture in his cell, and\\ntook therefrom two scraps of paper which he handed to Ganimard.\\n\\n“Ah!” exclaimed the detective, in surprise, “I thought you were closely\\nguarded and searched, and I find that you read the newspapers and\\ncollect postal receipts.”\\n\\n“Bah! these people are so stupid! They open the lining of my vest, they\\nexamine the soles of my shoes, they sound the walls of my cell, but they\\nnever imagine that Arsène Lupin would be foolish enough to choose such a\\nsimple hiding place.”\\n\\nGanimard laughed, as he said:\\n\\n“What a droll fellow you are! Really, you bewilder me. But, come now,\\ntell me about the Cahorn affair.”\\n\\n“Oh! oh! not quite so fast! You would rob me of all my secrets; expose\\nall my little tricks. That is a very serious matter.”\\n\\n“Was I wrong to count on your complaisance?”\\n\\n“No, Ganimard, and since you insist---”\\n\\nArsène Lupin paced his cell two or three times, then, stopping before\\nGanimard, he asked:\\n\\n“What do you think of my letter to the baron?”\\n\\n“I think you were amusing yourself by playing to the gallery.”\\n\\n“Ah! playing to the gallery! Come, Ganimard, I thought you knew me\\nbetter. Do I, Arsène Lupin, ever waste my time on such puerilities?\\nWould I have written that letter if I could have robbed the baron\\nwithout writing to him? I want you to understand that the letter was\\nindispensable; it was the motor that set the whole machine in motion.\\nNow, let us discuss together a scheme for the robbery of the Malaquis\\ncastle. Are you willing?”\\n\\n“Yes, proceed.”\\n\\n“Well, let us suppose a castle carefully closed and barricaded like\\nthat of the Baron Cahorn. Am I to abandon my scheme and renounce the\\ntreasures that I covet, upon the pretext that the castle which holds\\nthem is inaccessible?”\\n\\n“Evidently not.”\\n\\n“Should I make an assault upon the castle at the head of a band of\\nadventurers as they did in ancient times?”\\n\\n“That would be foolish.”\\n\\n“Can I gain admittance by stealth or cunning?”\\n\\n“Impossible.”\\n\\n“Then there is only one way open to me. I must have the owner of the\\ncastle invite me to it.”\\n\\n“That is surely an original method.”\\n\\n“And how easy! Let us suppose that one day the owner receives a letter\\nwarning him that a notorious burglar known as Arsène Lupin is plotting\\nto rob him. What will he do?”\\n\\n“Send a letter to the Procureur.”\\n\\n“Who will laugh at him, _because the said Arsène Lupin is actually in\\nprison_. Then, in his anxiety and fear, the simple man will ask the\\nassistance of the first-comer, will he not?”\\n\\n“Very likely.”\\n\\n“And if he happens to read in a country newspaper that a celebrated\\ndetective is spending his vacation in a neighboring town---”\\n\\n“He will seek that detective.”\\n\\n“Of course. But, on the other hand, let us presume that, having foreseen\\nthat state of affairs, the said Arsène Lupin has requested one of his\\nfriends to visit Caudebec, make the acquaintance of the editor of the\\n‘Réveil,’ a newspaper to which the baron is a subscriber, and let said\\neditor understand that such person is the celebrated detective--then,\\nwhat will happen?”\\n\\n“The editor will announce in the ‘Réveil’ the presence in Caudebec of\\nsaid detective.”\\n\\n“Exactly; and one of two things will happen: either the fish--I mean\\nCahorn--will not bite, and nothing will happen; or, what is more likely,\\nhe will run and greedily swallow the bait. Thus, behold my Baron Cahorn\\nimploring the assistance of one of my friends against me.”\\n\\n“Original, indeed!”\\n\\n“Of course, the pseudo-detective at first refuses to give any\\nassistance. On top of that comes the telegram from Arsène Lupin. The\\nfrightened baron rushes once more to my friend and offers him a definite\\nsum of money for his services. My friend accepts and summons two members\\nof our band, who, during the night, whilst Cahorn is under the watchful\\neye of his protector, removes certain articles by way of the window\\nand lowers them with ropes into a nice little launch chartered for the\\noccasion. Simple, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Marvelous! Marvelous!” exclaimed Ganimard. “The boldness of the scheme\\nand the ingenuity of all its details are beyond criticism. But who is\\nthe detective whose name and fame served as a magnet to attract the\\nbaron and draw him into your net?”\\n\\n“There is only one name could do it--only one.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin’s personal enemy--the most illustrious Ganimard.”\\n\\n“I?”\\n\\n“Yourself, Ganimard. And, really, it is very funny. If you go there, and\\nthe baron decides to talk, you will find that it will be your duty to\\narrest yourself, just as you arrested me in America. Hein! the revenge\\nis really amusing: I cause Ganimard to arrest Ganimard.”\\n\\nArsène Lupin laughed heartily. The detective, greatly vexed, bit his\\nlips; to him the joke was quite devoid of humor. The arrival of a prison\\nguard gave Ganimard an opportunity to recover himself. The man brought\\nArsène Lupin’s luncheon, furnished by a neighboring restaurant. After\\ndepositing the tray upon the table, the guard retired. Lupin broke his\\nbread, ate a few morsels, and continued:\\n\\n“But, rest easy, my dear Ganimard, you will not go to Malaquis. I can\\ntell you something that will astonish you: the Cahorn affair is on the\\npoint of being settled.”\\n\\n“Excuse me; I have just seen the Chief of the Sureté.”\\n\\n“What of that? Does Mon. Dudouis know my business better than I\\ndo myself? You will learn that Ganimard--excuse me--that the\\npseudo-Ganimard still remains on very good terms with the baron. The\\nlatter has authorized him to negotiate a very delicate transaction with\\nme, and, at the present moment, in consideration of a certain sum, it\\nis probable that the baron has recovered possession of his pictures and\\nother treasures. And on their return, he will withdraw his complaint.\\nThus, there is no longer any theft, and the law must abandon the case.”\\n\\nGanimard regarded the prisoner with a bewildered air.\\n\\n“And how do you know all that?”\\n\\n“I have just received the telegram I was expecting.”\\n\\n“You have just received a telegram?”\\n\\n“This very moment, my dear friend. Out of politeness, I did not wish to\\nread it in your presence. But if you will permit me---”\\n\\n“You are joking, Lupin.”\\n\\n“My dear friend, if you will be so kind as to break that egg, you will\\nlearn for yourself that I am not joking.”\\n\\nMechanically, Ganimard obeyed, and cracked the egg-shell with the blade\\nof a knife. He uttered a cry of surprise. The shell contained nothing\\nbut a small piece of blue paper. At the request of Arsène he unfolded\\nit. It was a telegram, or rather a portion of a telegram from which the\\npost-marks had been removed. It read as follows:\\n\\n“Contract closed. Hundred thousand balls delivered. All well.”\\n\\n“One hundred thousand balls?” said Ganimard.\\n\\n“Yes, one hundred thousand francs. Very little, but then, you know,\\nthese are hard times....And I have some heavy bills to meet. If you only\\nknew my budget.... living in the city comes very high.”\\n\\nGanimard arose. His ill humor had disappeared. He reflected for a\\nmoment, glancing over the whole affair in an effort to discover a weak\\npoint; then, in a tone and manner that betrayed his admiration of the\\nprisoner, he said:\\n\\n“Fortunately, we do not have a dozen such as you to deal with; if we\\ndid, we would have to close up shop.”\\n\\nArsène Lupin assumed a modest air, as he replied:\\n\\n“Bah! a person must have some diversion to occupy his leisure hours,\\nespecially when he is in prison.”\\n\\n“What!” exclaimed Ganimard, “your trial, your defense, the\\nexamination--isn’t that sufficient to occupy your mind?”\\n\\n“No, because I have decided not to be present at my trial.”\\n\\n“Oh! oh!”\\n\\nArsène Lupin repeated, positively:\\n\\n“I shall not be present at my trial.”\\n\\n“Really!”\\n\\n“Ah! my dear monsieur, do you suppose I am going to rot upon the wet\\nstraw? You insult me. Arsène Lupin remains in prison just as long as it\\npleases him, and not one minute more.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it would have been more prudent if you had avoided getting\\nthere,” said the detective, ironically.\\n\\n“Ah! monsieur jests? Monsieur must remember that he had the honor to\\neffect my arrest. Know then, my worthy friend, that no one, not even\\nyou, could have placed a hand upon me if a much more important event had\\nnot occupied my attention at that critical moment.”\\n\\n“You astonish me.”\\n\\n“A woman was looking at me, Ganimard, and I loved her. Do you fully\\nunderstand what that means: to be under the eyes of a woman that one\\nloves? I cared for nothing in the world but that. And that is why I am\\nhere.”\\n\\n“Permit me to say: you have been here a long time.”\\n\\n“In the first place, I wished to forget. Do not laugh; it was a\\ndelightful adventure and it is still a tender memory. Besides, I have\\nbeen suffering from neurasthenia. Life is so feverish these days that it\\nis necessary to take the ‘rest cure’ occasionally, and I find this spot\\na sovereign remedy for my tired nerves.”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin, you are not a bad fellow, after all.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Lupin. “Ganimard, this is Friday. On Wednesday next,\\nat four o’clock in the afternoon, I will smoke my cigar at your house in\\nthe rue Pergolese.”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin, I will expect you.”\\n\\nThey shook hands like two old friends who valued each other at their\\ntrue worth; then the detective stepped to the door.\\n\\n“Ganimard!”\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Ganimard, as he turned back.\\n\\n“You have forgotten your watch.”\\n\\n“My watch?”\\n\\n“Yes, it strayed into my pocket.”\\n\\nHe returned the watch, excusing himself.\\n\\n“Pardon me.... a bad habit. Because they have taken mine is no reason why\\nI should take yours. Besides, I have a chronometer here that satisfies\\nme fairly well.”\\n\\nHe took from the drawer a large gold watch and heavy chain.\\n\\n“From whose pocket did that come?” asked Ganimard.\\n\\nArsène Lupin gave a hasty glance at the initials engraved on the watch.\\n\\n“J.B.....Who the devil can that be?....Ah! yes, I remember. Jules\\nBouvier, the judge who conducted my examination. A charming fellow!....”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. The Escape of Arsène Lupin\\n\\n\\nArsène Lupin had just finished his repast and taken from his pocket an\\nexcellent cigar, with a gold band, which he was examining with unusual\\ncare, when the door of his cell was opened. He had barely time to\\nthrow the cigar into the drawer and move away from the table. The guard\\nentered. It was the hour for exercise.\\n\\n“I was waiting for you, my dear boy,” exclaimed Lupin, in his accustomed\\ngood humor.\\n\\nThey went out together. As soon as they had disappeared at a turn in the\\ncorridor, two men entered the cell and commenced a minute examination\\nof it. One was Inspector Dieuzy; the other was Inspector Folenfant. They\\nwished to verify their suspicion that Arsène Lupin was in communication\\nwith his accomplices outside of the prison. On the preceding evening,\\nthe ‘Grand Journal’ had published these lines addressed to its court\\nreporter:\\n\\n“Monsieur:\\n\\n“In a recent article you referred to me in most unjustifiable\\nterms. Some days before the opening of my trial I will call you to\\naccount. Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\nThe handwriting was certainly that of Arsène Lupin. Consequently, he\\nsent letters; and, no doubt, received letters. It was certain that he\\nwas preparing for that escape thus arrogantly announced by him.\\n\\nThe situation had become intolerable. Acting in conjunction with the\\nexamining judge, the chief of the Sûreté, Mon. Dudouis, had visited the\\nprison and instructed the gaoler in regard to the precautions necessary\\nto insure Lupin’s safety. At the same time, he sent the two men to\\nexamine the prisoner’s cell. They raised every stone, ransacked the bed,\\ndid everything customary in such a case, but they discovered nothing,\\nand were about to abandon their investigation when the guard entered\\nhastily and said:\\n\\n“The drawer.... look in the table-drawer. When I entered just now he was\\nclosing it.”\\n\\nThey opened the drawer, and Dieuzy exclaimed:\\n\\n“Ah! we have him this time.”\\n\\nFolenfant stopped him.\\n\\n“Wait a moment. The chief will want to make an inventory.”\\n\\n“This is a very choice cigar.”\\n\\n“Leave it there, and notify the chief.”\\n\\nTwo minutes later Mon. Dudouis examined the contents of the drawer.\\nFirst he discovered a bundle of newspaper clippings relating to Arsène\\nLupin taken from the _Argus de la Presse_, then a tobacco-box, a pipe,\\nsome paper called “onion-peel,” and two books. He read the titles of the\\nbooks. One was an English edition of Carlyle’s “Hero-worship”; the other\\nwas a charming elzevir, in modern binding, the “Manual of Epictetus,” a\\nGerman translation published at Leyden in 1634. On examining the books,\\nhe found that all the pages were underlined and annotated. Were they\\nprepared as a code for correspondence, or did they simply express the\\nstudious character of the reader? Then he examined the tobacco-box and\\nthe pipe. Finally, he took up the famous cigar with its gold band.\\n\\n“Fichtre!” he exclaimed. “Our friend smokes a good cigar. It’s a Henry\\nClay.”\\n\\nWith the mechanical action of an habitual smoker, he placed the cigar\\nclose to his ear and squeezed it to make it crack. Immediately he\\nuttered a cry of surprise. The cigar had yielded under the pressure\\nof his fingers. He examined it more closely, and quickly discovered\\nsomething white between the leaves of tobacco. Delicately, with the aid\\nof a pin, he withdrew a roll of very thin paper, scarcely larger than\\na toothpick. It was a letter. He unrolled it, and found these words,\\nwritten in a feminine handwriting:\\n\\n“The basket has taken the place of the others. Eight out of ten are\\nready. On pressing the outer foot the plate goes downward. From twelve\\nto sixteen every day, H-P will wait. But where? Reply at once. Rest\\neasy; your friend is watching over you.”\\n\\nMon. Dudouis reflected a moment, then said:\\n\\n“It is quite clear.... the basket.... the eight compartments.... From\\ntwelve to sixteen means from twelve to four o’clock.”\\n\\n“But this H-P, that will wait?”\\n\\n“H-P must mean automobile. H-P, horsepower, is the way they indicate\\nstrength of the motor. A twenty-four H-P is an automobile of twenty-four\\nhorsepower.”\\n\\nThen he rose, and asked:\\n\\n“Had the prisoner finished his breakfast?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And as he has not yet read the message, which is proved by the\\ncondition of the cigar, it is probable that he had just received it.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“In his food. Concealed in his bread or in a potato, perhaps.”\\n\\n“Impossible. His food was allowed to be brought in simply to trap him,\\nbut we have never found anything in it.”\\n\\n“We will look for Lupin’s reply this evening. Detain him outside for a\\nfew minutes. I shall take this to the examining judge, and, if he agrees\\nwith me, we will have the letter photographed at once, and in an hour\\nyou can replace the letter in the drawer in a cigar similar to this. The\\nprisoner must have no cause for suspicion.”\\n\\nIt was not without a certain curiosity that Mon. Dudouis returned to\\nthe prison in the evening, accompanied by Inspector Dieuzy. Three empty\\nplates were sitting on the stove in the corner.\\n\\n“He has eaten?”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the guard.\\n\\n“Dieuzy, please cut that macaroni into very small pieces, and open that\\nbread-roll....Nothing?”\\n\\n“No, chief.”\\n\\nMon. Dudouis examined the plates, the fork, the spoon, and the knife--an\\nordinary knife with a rounded blade. He turned the handle to the left;\\nthen to the right. It yielded and unscrewed. The knife was hollow, and\\nserved as a hiding-place for a sheet of paper.\\n\\n“Peuh!” he said, “that is not very clever for a man like Arsène. But we\\nmustn’t lose any time. You, Dieuzy, go and search the restaurant.”\\n\\nThen he read the note:\\n\\n“I trust to you, H-P will follow at a distance every day. I will go\\nahead. Au revoir, dear friend.”\\n\\n“At last,” cried Mon. Dudouis, rubbing his hands gleefully, “I think we\\nhave the affair in our own hands. A little strategy on our part, and the\\nescape will be a success in so far as the arrest of his confederates are\\nconcerned.”\\n\\n“But if Arsène Lupin slips through your fingers?” suggested the guard.\\n\\n“We will have a sufficient number of men to prevent that. If, however,\\nhe displays too much cleverness, ma foi, so much the worse for him! As\\nto his band of robbers, since the chief refuses to speak, the others\\nmust.”\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nAnd, as a matter of fact, Arsène Lupin had very little to say. For\\nseveral months, Mon. Jules Bouvier, the examining judge, had\\nexerted himself in vain. The investigation had been reduced to a few\\nuninteresting arguments between the judge and the advocate, Maître\\nDanval, one of the leaders of the bar. From time to time, through\\ncourtesy, Arsène Lupin would speak. One day he said:\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur, le judge, I quite agree with you: the robbery of the\\nCrédit Lyonnais, the theft in the rue de Babylone, the issue of\\nthe counterfeit bank-notes, the burglaries at the various châteaux,\\nArmesnil, Gouret, Imblevain, Groseillers, Malaquis, all my work,\\nmonsieur, I did it all.”\\n\\n“Then will you explain to me---”\\n\\n“It is useless. I confess everything in a lump, everything and even ten\\ntimes more than you know nothing about.”\\n\\nWearied by his fruitless task, the judge had suspended his examinations,\\nbut he resumed them after the two intercepted messages were brought to\\nhis attention; and regularly, at mid-day, Arsène Lupin was taken from\\nthe prison to the Dépôt in the prison-van with a certain number of other\\nprisoners. They returned about three or four o’clock.\\n\\nNow, one afternoon, this return trip was made under unusual conditions.\\nThe other prisoners not having been examined, it was decided to take\\nback Arsène Lupin first, thus he found himself alone in the vehicle.\\n\\nThese prison-vans, vulgarly called “panniers à salade”--or\\nsalad-baskets--are divided lengthwise by a central corridor from which\\nopen ten compartments, five on either side. Each compartment is so\\narranged that the occupant must assume and retain a sitting posture,\\nand, consequently, the five prisoners are seated one upon the other,\\nand yet separated one from the other by partitions. A municipal guard,\\nstanding at one end, watches over the corridor.\\n\\nArsène was placed in the third cell on the right, and the heavy vehicle\\nstarted. He carefully calculated when they left the quai de l’Horloge,\\nand when they passed the Palais de Justice. Then, about the centre of\\nthe bridge Saint Michel, with his outer foot, that is to say, his right\\nfoot, he pressed upon the metal plate that closed his cell. Immediately\\nsomething clicked, and the metal plate moved. He was able to ascertain\\nthat he was located between the two wheels.\\n\\nHe waited, keeping a sharp look-out. The vehicle was proceeding slowly\\nalong the boulevard Saint Michel. At the corner of Saint Germain it\\nstopped. A truck horse had fallen. The traffic having been interrupted,\\na vast throng of fiacres and omnibuses had gathered there. Arsène Lupin\\nlooked out. Another prison-van had stopped close to the one he occupied.\\nHe moved the plate still farther, put his foot on one of the spokes\\nof the wheel and leaped to the ground. A coachman saw him, roared with\\nlaughter, then tried to raise an outcry, but his voice was lost in the\\nnoise of the traffic that had commenced to move again. Moreover, Arsène\\nLupin was already far away.\\n\\nHe had run for a few steps; but, once upon the sidewalk, he turned\\nand looked around; he seemed to scent the wind like a person who is\\nuncertain which direction to take. Then, having decided, he put his\\nhands in his pockets, and, with the careless air of an idle stroller,\\nhe proceeded up the boulevard. It was a warm, bright autumn day, and\\nthe cafés were full. He took a seat on the terrace of one of them. He\\nordered a bock and a package of cigarettes. He emptied his glass slowly,\\nsmoked one cigarette and lighted a second. Then he asked the waiter to\\nsend the proprietor to him. When the proprietor came, Arsène spoke to\\nhim in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone:\\n\\n“I regret to say, monsieur, I have forgotten my pocketbook. Perhaps, on\\nthe strength of my name, you will be pleased to give me credit for a few\\ndays. I am Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\nThe proprietor looked at him, thinking he was joking. But Arsène\\nrepeated:\\n\\n“Lupin, prisoner at the Santé, but now a fugitive. I venture to assume\\nthat the name inspires you with perfect confidence in me.”\\n\\nAnd he walked away, amidst shouts of laughter, whilst the proprietor\\nstood amazed.\\n\\nLupin strolled along the rue Soufflot, and turned into the rue Saint\\nJacques. He pursued his way slowly, smoking his cigarettes and looking\\ninto the shop-windows. At the Boulevard de Port Royal he took his\\nbearings, discovered where he was, and then walked in the direction of\\nthe rue de la Santé. The high forbidding walls of the prison were\\nnow before him. He pulled his hat forward to shade his face; then,\\napproaching the sentinel, he asked:\\n\\n“Is this the prison de la Santé?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I wish to regain my cell. The van left me on the way, and I would not\\nabuse--”\\n\\n“Now, young man, move along--quick!” growled the sentinel.\\n\\n“Pardon me, but I must pass through that gate. And if you prevent Arsène\\nLupin from entering the prison it will cost you dear, my friend.”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin! What are you talking about!”\\n\\n“I am sorry I haven’t a card with me,” said Arsène, fumbling in his\\npockets.\\n\\nThe sentinel eyed him from head to foot, in astonishment. Then, without\\na word, he rang a bell. The iron gate was partly opened, and Arsène\\nstepped inside. Almost immediately he encountered the keeper of the\\nprison, gesticulating and feigning a violent anger. Arsène smiled and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Come, monsieur, don’t play that game with me. What! they take\\nthe precaution to carry me alone in the van, prepare a nice little\\nobstruction, and imagine I am going to take to my heels and rejoin\\nmy friends. Well, and what about the twenty agents of the Sûreté who\\naccompanied us on foot, in fiacres and on bicycles? No, the arrangement\\ndid not please me. I should not have got away alive. Tell me, monsieur,\\ndid they count on that?”\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and added:\\n\\n“I beg of you, monsieur, not to worry about me. When I wish to escape I\\nshall not require any assistance.”\\n\\nOn the second day thereafter, the _Echo de France_, which had apparently\\nbecome the official reporter of the exploits of Arsène Lupin,--it was\\nsaid that he was one of its principal shareholders--published a most\\ncomplete account of this attempted escape. The exact wording of the\\nmessages exchanged between the prisoner and his mysterious friend, the\\nmeans by which correspondence was constructed, the complicity of the\\npolice, the promenade on the Boulevard Saint Michel, the incident at the\\ncafé Soufflot, everything was disclosed. It was known that the search of\\nthe restaurant and its waiters by Inspector Dieuzy had been fruitless.\\nAnd the public also learned an extraordinary thing which demonstrated\\nthe infinite variety of resources that Lupin possessed: the prison-van,\\nin which he was being carried, was prepared for the occasion and\\nsubstituted by his accomplices for one of the six vans which did service\\nat the prison.\\n\\nThe next escape of Arsène Lupin was not doubted by anyone. He announced\\nit himself, in categorical terms, in a reply to Mon. Bouvier on the day\\nfollowing his attempted escape. The judge having made a jest about\\nthe affair, Arsène was annoyed, and, firmly eyeing the judge, he said,\\nemphatically:\\n\\n“Listen to me, monsieur! I give you my word of honor that this attempted\\nflight was simply preliminary to my general plan of escape.”\\n\\n“I do not understand,” said the judge.\\n\\n“It is not necessary that you should understand.”\\n\\nAnd when the judge, in the course of that examination which was reported\\nat length in the columns of the _Echo de France_, when the judge sought\\nto resume his investigation, Arsène Lupin exclaimed, with an assumed air\\nof lassitude:\\n\\n“Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu, what’s the use! All these questions are of no\\nimportance!”\\n\\n“What! No importance?” cried the judge.\\n\\n“No; because I shall not be present at the trial.”\\n\\n“You will not be present?”\\n\\n“No; I have fully decided on that, and nothing will change my mind.”\\n\\nSuch assurance combined with the inexplicable indiscretions that Arsène\\ncommitted every day served to annoy and mystify the officers of the law.\\nThere were secrets known only to Arsène Lupin; secrets that he alone\\ncould divulge. But for what purpose did he reveal them? And how?\\n\\nArsène Lupin was changed to another cell. The judge closed his\\npreliminary investigation. No further proceedings were taken in his case\\nfor a period of two months, during which time Arsène was seen almost\\nconstantly lying on his bed with his face turned toward the wall. The\\nchanging of his cell seemed to discourage him. He refused to see his\\nadvocate. He exchanged only a few necessary words with his keepers.\\n\\nDuring the fortnight preceding his trial, he resumed his vigorous life.\\nHe complained of want of air. Consequently, early every morning he was\\nallowed to exercise in the courtyard, guarded by two men.\\n\\nPublic curiosity had not died out; every day it expected to be regaled\\nwith news of his escape; and, it is true, he had gained a considerable\\namount of public sympathy by reason of his verve, his gayety, his\\ndiversity, his inventive genius and the mystery of his life. Arsène\\nLupin must escape. It was his inevitable fate. The public expected it,\\nand was surprised that the event had been delayed so long. Every morning\\nthe Préfect of Police asked his secretary:\\n\\n“Well, has he escaped yet?”\\n\\n“No, Monsieur le Préfect.”\\n\\n“To-morrow, probably.”\\n\\nAnd, on the day before the trial, a gentleman called at the office of\\nthe ‘Grand Journal,’ asked to see the court reporter, threw his card in\\nthe reporter’s face, and walked rapidly away. These words were written\\non the card: “Arsène Lupin always keeps his promises.”\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nIt was under these conditions that the trial commenced. An enormous\\ncrowd gathered at the court. Everybody wished to see the famous Arsène\\nLupin. They had a gleeful anticipation that the prisoner would play some\\naudacious pranks upon the judge. Advocates and magistrates, reporters\\nand men of the world, actresses and society women were crowded together\\non the benches provided for the public.\\n\\nIt was a dark, sombre day, with a steady downpour of rain. Only a\\ndim light pervaded the courtroom, and the spectators caught a very\\nindistinct view of the prisoner when the guards brought him in. But his\\nheavy, shambling walk, the manner in which he dropped into his seat, and\\nhis passive, stupid appearance were not at all prepossessing. Several\\ntimes his advocate--one of Mon. Danval’s assistants--spoke to him, but\\nhe simply shook his head and said nothing.\\n\\nThe clerk read the indictment, then the judge spoke:\\n\\n“Prisoner at the bar, stand up. Your name, age, and occupation?”\\n\\nNot receiving any reply, the judge repeated:\\n\\n“Your name? I ask you your name?”\\n\\nA thick, slow voice muttered:\\n\\n“Baudru, Désiré.”\\n\\nA murmur of surprise pervaded the courtroom. But the judge proceeded:\\n\\n“Baudru, Désiré? Ah! a new alias! Well, as you have already assumed a\\ndozen different names and this one is, no doubt, as imaginary as the\\nothers, we will adhere to the name of Arsène Lupin, by which you are\\nmore generally known.”\\n\\nThe judge referred to his notes, and continued:\\n\\n“For, despite the most diligent search, your past history remains\\nunknown. Your case is unique in the annals of crime. We know not whom\\nyou are, whence you came, your birth and breeding--all is a mystery\\nto us. Three years ago you appeared in our midst as Arsène Lupin,\\npresenting to us a strange combination of intelligence and perversion,\\nimmorality and generosity. Our knowledge of your life prior to that date\\nis vague and problematical. It may be that the man called Rostat who,\\neight years ago, worked with Dickson, the prestidigitator, was none\\nother than Arsène Lupin. It is probable that the Russian student who,\\nsix years ago, attended the laboratory of Doctor Altier at the Saint\\nLouis Hospital, and who often astonished the doctor by the ingenuity\\nof his hypotheses on subjects of bacteriology and the boldness of his\\nexperiments in diseases of the skin, was none other than Arsène Lupin.\\nIt is probable, also, that Arsène Lupin was the professor who introduced\\nthe Japanese art of jiu-jitsu to the Parisian public. We have some\\nreason to believe that Arsène Lupin was the bicyclist who won the Grand\\nPrix de l’Exposition, received his ten thousand francs, and was never\\nheard of again. Arsène Lupin may have been, also, the person who saved\\nso many lives through the little dormer-window at the Charity Bazaar;\\nand, at the same time, picked their pockets.”\\n\\nThe judge paused for a moment, then continued:\\n\\n“Such is that epoch which seems to have been utilized by you in a\\nthorough preparation for the warfare you have since waged against\\nsociety; a methodical apprenticeship in which you developed your\\nstrength, energy and skill to the highest point possible. Do you\\nacknowledge the accuracy of these facts?”\\n\\nDuring this discourse the prisoner had stood balancing himself, first\\non one foot, then on the other, with shoulders stooped and arms inert.\\nUnder the strongest light one could observe his extreme thinness, his\\nhollow cheeks, his projecting cheek-bones, his earthen-colored face\\ndotted with small red spots and framed in a rough, straggling beard.\\nPrison life had caused him to age and wither. He had lost the\\nyouthful face and elegant figure we had seen portrayed so often in the\\nnewspapers.\\n\\nIt appeared as if he had not heard the question propounded by the\\njudge. Twice it was repeated to him. Then he raised his eyes, seemed to\\nreflect, then, making a desperate effort, he murmured:\\n\\n“Baudru, Désiré.”\\n\\nThe judge smiled, as he said:\\n\\n“I do not understand the theory of your defense, Arsène Lupin. If you\\nare seeking to avoid responsibility for your crimes on the ground of\\nimbecility, such a line of defense is open to you. But I shall proceed\\nwith the trial and pay no heed to your vagaries.”\\n\\nHe then narrated at length the various thefts, swindles and forgeries\\ncharged against Lupin. Sometimes he questioned the prisoner, but the\\nlatter simply grunted or remained silent. The examination of witnesses\\ncommenced. Some of the evidence given was immaterial; other portions\\nof it seemed more important, but through all of it there ran a vein of\\ncontradictions and inconsistencies. A wearisome obscurity enveloped\\nthe proceedings, until Detective Ganimard was called as a witness; then\\ninterest was revived.\\n\\nFrom the beginning the actions of the veteran detective appeared strange\\nand unaccountable. He was nervous and ill at ease. Several times he\\nlooked at the prisoner, with obvious doubt and anxiety. Then, with his\\nhands resting on the rail in front of him, he recounted the events in\\nwhich he had participated, including his pursuit of the prisoner\\nacross Europe and his arrival in America. He was listened to with great\\navidity, as his capture of Arsène Lupin was well known to everyone\\nthrough the medium of the press. Toward the close of his testimony,\\nafter referring to his conversations with Arsène Lupin, he stopped,\\ntwice, embarrassed and undecided. It was apparent that he was possessed\\nof some thought which he feared to utter. The judge said to him,\\nsympathetically:\\n\\n“If you are ill, you may retire for the present.”\\n\\n“No, no, but---”\\n\\nHe stopped, looked sharply at the prisoner, and said:\\n\\n“I ask permission to scrutinize the prisoner at closer range. There is\\nsome mystery about him that I must solve.”\\n\\nHe approached the accused man, examined him attentively for several\\nminutes, then returned to the witness-stand, and, in an almost solemn\\nvoice, he said:\\n\\n“I declare, on oath, that the prisoner now before me is not Arsène\\nLupin.”\\n\\nA profound silence followed the statement. The judge, nonplused for a\\nmoment, exclaimed:\\n\\n“Ah! What do you mean? That is absurd!”\\n\\nThe detective continued:\\n\\n“At first sight there is a certain resemblance, but if you carefully\\nconsider the nose, the mouth, the hair, the color of skin, you will\\nsee that it is not Arsène Lupin. And the eyes! Did he ever have those\\nalcoholic eyes!”\\n\\n“Come, come, witness! What do you mean? Do you pretend to say that we\\nare trying the wrong man?”\\n\\n“In my opinion, yes. Arsène Lupin has, in some manner, contrived to put\\nthis poor devil in his place, unless this man is a willing accomplice.”\\n\\nThis dramatic dénouement caused much laughter and excitement amongst the\\nspectators. The judge adjourned the trial, and sent for Mon. Bouvier,\\nthe gaoler, and guards employed in the prison.\\n\\nWhen the trial was resumed, Mon. Bouvier and the gaoler examined the\\naccused and declared that there was only a very slight resemblance\\nbetween the prisoner and Arsène Lupin.\\n\\n“Well, then!” exclaimed the judge, “who is this man? Where does he come\\nfrom? What is he in prison for?”\\n\\nTwo of the prison-guards were called and both of them declared that the\\nprisoner was Arsène Lupin. The judged breathed once more.\\n\\nBut one of the guards then said:\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I think it is he.”\\n\\n“What!” cried the judge, impatiently, “you *think* it is he! What do you\\nmean by that?”\\n\\n“Well, I saw very little of the prisoner. He was placed in my charge in\\nthe evening and, for two months, he seldom stirred, but laid on his bed\\nwith his face to the wall.”\\n\\n“What about the time prior to those two months?”\\n\\n“Before that he occupied a cell in another part of the prison. He was\\nnot in cell 24.”\\n\\nHere the head gaoler interrupted, and said:\\n\\n“We changed him to another cell after his attempted escape.”\\n\\n“But you, monsieur, you have seen him during those two months?”\\n\\n“I had no occasion to see him. He was always quiet and orderly.”\\n\\n“And this prisoner is not Arsène Lupin?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Then who is he?” demanded the judge.\\n\\n“I do not know.”\\n\\n“Then we have before us a man who was substituted for Arsène Lupin, two\\nmonths ago. How do you explain that?”\\n\\n“I cannot.”\\n\\nIn absolute despair, the judge turned to the accused and addressed him\\nin a conciliatory tone:\\n\\n“Prisoner, can you tell me how, and since when, you became an inmate of\\nthe Prison de la Santé?”\\n\\nThe engaging manner of the judge was calculated to disarm the mistrust\\nand awaken the understanding of the accused man. He tried to reply.\\nFinally, under clever and gentle questioning, he succeeded in framing a\\nfew phrases from which the following story was gleaned: Two months ago\\nhe had been taken to the Dépôt, examined and released. As he was leaving\\nthe building, a free man, he was seized by two guards and placed in the\\nprison-van. Since then he had occupied cell 24. He was contented there,\\nplenty to eat, and he slept well--so he did not complain.\\n\\nAll that seemed probable; and, amidst the mirth and excitement of the\\nspectators, the judge adjourned the trial until the story could be\\ninvestigated and verified.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nThe following facts were at once established by an examination of the\\nprison records: Eight weeks before a man named Baudru Désiré had slept\\nat the Dépôt. He was released the next day, and left the Dépôt at two\\no’clock in the afternoon. On the same day at two o’clock, having been\\nexamined for the last time, Arsène Lupin left the Dépôt in a prison-van.\\n\\nHad the guards made a mistake? Had they been deceived by the resemblance\\nand carelessly substituted this man for their prisoner?\\n\\nAnother question suggested itself: Had the substitution been arranged in\\nadvance? In that event Baudru must have been an accomplice and must have\\ncaused his own arrest for the express purpose of taking Lupin’s\\nplace. But then, by what miracle had such a plan, based on a series of\\nimprobable chances, been carried to success?\\n\\nBaudru Désiré was turned over to the anthropological service; they\\nhad never seen anything like him. However, they easily traced his past\\nhistory. He was known at Courbevois, at Asnières and at Levallois.\\nHe lived on alms and slept in one of those rag-picker’s huts near the\\nbarrier de Ternes. He had disappeared from there a year ago.\\n\\nHad he been enticed away by Arsène Lupin? There was no evidence to that\\neffect. And even if that was so, it did not explain the flight of the\\nprisoner. That still remained a mystery. Amongst twenty theories which\\nsought to explain it, not one was satisfactory. Of the escape itself,\\nthere was no doubt; an escape that was incomprehensible, sensational,\\nin which the public, as well as the officers of the law, could detect\\na carefully prepared plan, a combination of circumstances marvelously\\ndove-tailed, whereof the dénouement fully justified the confident\\nprediction of Arsène Lupin: “I shall not be present at my trial.”\\n\\nAfter a month of patient investigation, the problem remained unsolved.\\nThe poor devil of a Baudru could not be kept in prison indefinitely, and\\nto place him on trial would be ridiculous. There was no charge against\\nhim. Consequently, he was released; but the chief of the Sûrété resolved\\nto keep him under surveillance. This idea originated with Ganimard. From\\nhis point of view there was neither complicity nor chance. Baudru was\\nan instrument upon which Arsène Lupin had played with his extraordinary\\nskill. Baudru, when set at liberty, would lead them to Arsène Lupin or,\\nat least, to some of his accomplices. The two inspectors, Folenfant and\\nDieuzy, were assigned to assist Ganimard.\\n\\nOne foggy morning in January the prison gates opened and Baudru Désiré\\nstepped forth--a free man. At first he appeared to be quite embarrassed,\\nand walked like a person who has no precise idea whither he is going.\\nHe followed the rue de la Santé and the rue Saint Jacques. He stopped in\\nfront of an old-clothes shop, removed his jacket and his vest, sold his\\nvest on which he realized a few sous; then, replacing his jacket, he\\nproceeded on his way. He crossed the Seine. At the Châtelet an\\nomnibus passed him. He wished to enter it, but there was no place.\\nThe controller advised him to secure a number, so he entered the\\nwaiting-room.\\n\\nGanimard called to his two assistants, and, without removing his eyes\\nfrom the waiting room, he said to them:\\n\\n“Stop a carriage.... no, two. That will be better. I will go with one of\\nyou, and we will follow him.”\\n\\nThe men obeyed. Yet Baudru did not appear. Ganimard entered the\\nwaiting-room. It was empty.\\n\\n“Idiot that I am!” he muttered, “I forgot there was another exit.”\\n\\nThere was an interior corridor extending from the waiting-room to the\\nrue Saint Martin. Ganimard rushed through it and arrived just in time to\\nobserve Baudru upon the top of the Batignolles-Jardin de Plates omnibus\\nas it was turning the corner of the rue de Rivoli. He ran and caught\\nthe omnibus. But he had lost his two assistants. He must continue the\\npursuit alone. In his anger he was inclined to seize the man by the\\ncollar without ceremony. Was it not with premeditation and by means of\\nan ingenious ruse that his pretended imbecile had separated him from his\\nassistants?\\n\\nHe looked at Baudru. The latter was asleep on the bench, his head\\nrolling from side to side, his mouth half-opened, and an incredible\\nexpression of stupidity on his blotched face. No, such an adversary was\\nincapable of deceiving old Ganimard. It was a stroke of luck--nothing\\nmore.\\n\\nAt the Galleries-Lafayette, the man leaped from the omnibus and took\\nthe La Muette tramway, following the boulevard Haussmann and the\\navenue Victor Hugo. Baudru alighted at La Muette station; and, with a\\nnonchalant air, strolled into the Bois de Boulogne.\\n\\nHe wandered through one path after another, and sometimes retraced his\\nsteps. What was he seeking? Had he any definite object? At the end of\\nan hour, he appeared to be faint from fatigue, and, noticing a bench, he\\nsat down. The spot, not far from Auteuil, on the edge of a pond hidden\\namongst the trees, was absolutely deserted. After the lapse of another\\nhalf-hour, Ganimard became impatient and resolved to speak to the man.\\nHe approached and took a seat beside Baudru, lighted a cigarette, traced\\nsome figures in the sand with the end of his cane, and said:\\n\\n“It’s a pleasant day.”\\n\\nNo response. But, suddenly the man burst into laughter, a happy,\\nmirthful laugh, spontaneous and irresistible. Ganimard felt his hair\\nstand on end in horror and surprise. It was that laugh, that infernal\\nlaugh he knew so well!\\n\\nWith a sudden movement, he seized the man by the collar and looked at\\nhim with a keen, penetrating gaze; and found that he no longer saw the\\nman Baudru. To be sure, he saw Baudru; but, at the same time, he saw the\\nother, the real man, Lupin. He discovered the intense life in the eyes,\\nhe filled up the shrunken features, he perceived the real flesh beneath\\nthe flabby skin, the real mouth through the grimaces that deformed it.\\nThose were the eyes and mouth of the other, and especially his keen,\\nalert, mocking expression, so clear and youthful!\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin, Arsène Lupin,” he stammered.\\n\\nThen, in a sudden fit of rage, he seized Lupin by the throat and tried\\nto hold him down. In spite of his fifty years, he still possessed\\nunusual strength, whilst his adversary was apparently in a weak\\ncondition. But the struggle was a brief one. Arsène Lupin made only a\\nslight movement, and, as suddenly as he had made the attack, Ganimard\\nreleased his hold. His right arm fell inert, useless.\\n\\n“If you had taken lessons in jiu-jitsu at the quai des Orfèvres,” said\\nLupin, “you would know that that blow is called udi-shi-ghi in Japanese.\\nA second more, and I would have broken your arm and that would have been\\njust what you deserve. I am surprised that you, an old friend whom I\\nrespect and before whom I voluntarily expose my incognito, should abuse\\nmy confidence in that violent manner. It is unworthy--Ah! What’s the\\nmatter?”\\n\\nGanimard did not reply. That escape for which he deemed himself\\nresponsible--was it not he, Ganimard, who, by his sensational evidence,\\nhad led the court into serious error? That escape appeared to him like\\na dark cloud on his professional career. A tear rolled down his cheek to\\nhis gray moustache.\\n\\n“Oh! mon Dieu, Ganimard, don’t take it to heart. If you had not spoken,\\nI would have arranged for some one else to do it. I couldn’t allow poor\\nBaudru Désiré to be convicted.”\\n\\n“Then,” murmured Ganimard, “it was you that was there? And now you are\\nhere?”\\n\\n“It is I, always I, only I.”\\n\\n“Can it be possible?”\\n\\n“Oh, it is not the work of a sorcerer. Simply, as the judge remarked at\\nthe trial, the apprenticeship of a dozen years that equips a man to cope\\nsuccessfully with all the obstacles in life.”\\n\\n“But your face? Your eyes?”\\n\\n“You can understand that if I worked eighteen months with Doctor Altier\\nat the Saint-Louis hospital, it was not out of love for the work. I\\nconsidered that he, who would one day have the honor of calling himself\\nArsène Lupin, ought to be exempt from the ordinary laws governing\\nappearance and identity. Appearance? That can be modified at will. For\\ninstance, a hypodermic injection of paraffine will puff up the skin at\\nthe desired spot. Pyrogallic acid will change your skin to that of an\\nIndian. The juice of the greater celandine will adorn you with the most\\nbeautiful eruptions and tumors. Another chemical affects the growth of\\nyour beard and hair; another changes the tone of your voice. Add to that\\ntwo months of dieting in cell 24; exercises repeated a thousand times to\\nenable me to hold my features in a certain grimace, to carry my head\\nat a certain inclination, and adapt my back and shoulders to a stooping\\nposture. Then five drops of atropine in the eyes to make them haggard\\nand wild, and the trick is done.”\\n\\n“I do not understand how you deceived the guards.”\\n\\n“The change was progressive. The evolution was so gradual that they\\nfailed to notice it.”\\n\\n“But Baudru Désiré?”\\n\\n“Baudru exists. He is a poor, harmless fellow whom\\nI met last year; and, really, he bears a certain resemblance to me.\\nConsidering my arrest as a possible event, I took charge of Baudru and\\nstudied the points wherein we differed in appearance with a view to\\ncorrect them in my own person. My friends caused him to remain at the\\nDépôt overnight, and to leave there next day about the same hour as I\\ndid--a coincidence easily arranged. Of course, it was necessary to have\\na record of his detention at the Dépôt in order to establish the fact\\nthat such a person was a reality; otherwise, the police would have\\nsought elsewhere to find out my identity. But, in offering to them this\\nexcellent Baudru, it was inevitable, you understand, inevitable that\\nthey would seize upon him, and, despite the insurmountable difficulties\\nof a substitution, they would prefer to believe in a substitution than\\nconfess their ignorance.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, of course,” said Ganimard.\\n\\n“And then,” exclaimed Arsène Lupin, “I held in my hands a trump-card: an\\nanxious public watching and waiting for my escape. And that is the fatal\\nerror into which you fell, you and the others, in the course of that\\nfascinating game pending between me and the officers of the law wherein\\nthe stake was my liberty. And you supposed that I was playing to the\\ngallery; that I was intoxicated with my success. I, Arsène Lupin, guilty\\nof such weakness! Oh, no! And, no longer ago than the Cahorn affair, you\\nsaid: “When Arsène Lupin cries from the housetops that he will escape,\\nhe has some object in view.” But, sapristi, you must understand that\\nin order to escape I must create, in advance, a public belief in\\nthat escape, a belief amounting to an article of faith, an absolute\\nconviction, a reality as glittering as the sun. And I did create that\\nbelief that Arsène Lupin would escape, that Arsène Lupin would not be\\npresent at his trial. And when you gave your evidence and said: “That\\nman is not Arsène Lupin,” everybody was prepared to believe you. Had one\\nperson doubted it, had any one uttered this simple restriction: Suppose\\nit is Arsène Lupin?--from that moment, I was lost. If anyone had\\nscrutinized my face, not imbued with the idea that I was not Arsène\\nLupin, as you and the others did at my trial, but with the idea that I\\nmight be Arsène Lupin; then, despite all my precautions, I should have\\nbeen recognized. But I had no fear. Logically, psychologically, no once\\ncould entertain the idea that I was Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\nHe grasped Ganimard’s hand.\\n\\n“Come, Ganimard, confess that on the Wednesday after our conversation in\\nthe prison de la Santé, you expected me at your house at four o’clock,\\nexactly as I said I would go.”\\n\\n“And your prison-van?” said Ganimard, evading the question.\\n\\n“A bluff! Some of my friends secured that old unused van and wished\\nto make the attempt. But I considered it impractical without the\\nconcurrence of a number of unusual circumstances. However, I found\\nit useful to carry out that attempted escape and give it the widest\\npublicity. An audaciously planned escape, though not completed, gave to\\nthe succeeding one the character of reality simply by anticipation.”\\n\\n“So that the cigar....”\\n\\n“Hollowed by myself, as well as the knife.”\\n\\n“And the letters?”\\n\\n“Written by me.”\\n\\n“And the mysterious correspondent?”\\n\\n“Did not exist.”\\n\\nGanimard reflected a moment, then said:\\n\\n“When the anthropological service had Baudru’s case under consideration,\\nwhy did they not perceive that his measurements coincided with those of\\nArsène Lupin?”\\n\\n“My measurements are not in existence.”\\n\\n“Indeed!”\\n\\n“At least, they are false. I have given considerable attention to\\nthat question. In the first place, the Bertillon system records the\\nvisible marks of identification--and you have seen that they are not\\ninfallible--and, after that, the measurements of the head, the\\nfingers, the ears, etc. Of course, such measurements are more or less\\ninfallible.”\\n\\n“Absolutely.”\\n\\n“No; but it costs money to get around them. Before we left America, one\\nof the employees of the service there accepted so much money to insert\\nfalse figures in my measurements. Consequently, Baudru’s measurements\\nshould not agree with those of Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\nAfter a short silence, Ganimard asked:\\n\\n“What are you going to do now?”\\n\\n“Now,” replied Lupin, “I am going to take a rest, enjoy the best of food\\nand drink and gradually recover my former healthy condition. It is all\\nvery well to become Baudru or some other person, on occasion, and to\\nchange your personality as you do your shirt, but you soon grow weary of\\nthe change. I feel exactly as I imagine the man who lost his shadow must\\nhave felt, and I shall be glad to be Arsène Lupin once more.”\\n\\nHe walked to and fro for a few minutes, then, stopping in front of\\nGanimard, he said:\\n\\n“You have nothing more to say, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes. I should like to know if you intend to reveal the true state of\\nfacts connected with your escape. The mistake that I made---”\\n\\n“Oh! no one will ever know that it was Arsène Lupin who was discharged.\\nIt is to my own interest to surround myself with mystery, and therefore\\nI shall permit my escape to retain its almost miraculous character. So,\\nhave no fear on that score, my dear friend. I shall say nothing. And\\nnow, good-bye. I am going out to dinner this evening, and have only\\nsufficient time to dress.”\\n\\n“I though you wanted a rest.”\\n\\n“Ah! there are duties to society that one cannot avoid. To-morrow, I\\nshall rest.”\\n\\n“Where do you dine to-night?”\\n\\n“With the British Ambassador!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. The Mysterious Traveller\\n\\n\\nThe evening before, I had sent my automobile to Rouen by the highway.\\nI was to travel to Rouen by rail, on my way to visit some friends that\\nlive on the banks of the Seine.\\n\\nAt Paris, a few minutes before the train started, seven gentlemen\\nentered my compartment; five of them were smoking. No matter that the\\njourney was a short one, the thought of traveling with such a company\\nwas not agreeable to me, especially as the car was built on the old\\nmodel, without a corridor. I picked up my overcoat, my newspapers and my\\ntime-table, and sought refuge in a neighboring compartment.\\n\\nIt was occupied by a lady, who, at sight of me, made a gesture of\\nannoyance that did not escape my notice, and she leaned toward a\\ngentleman who was standing on the step and was, no doubt, her husband.\\nThe gentleman scrutinized me closely, and, apparently, my appearance did\\nnot displease him, for he smiled as he spoke to his wife with the air\\nof one who reassures a frightened child. She smiled also, and gave me a\\nfriendly glance as if she now understood that I was one of those gallant\\nmen with whom a woman can remain shut up for two hours in a little box,\\nsix feet square, and have nothing to fear.\\n\\nHer husband said to her:\\n\\n“I have an important appointment, my dear, and cannot wait any longer.\\nAdieu.”\\n\\nHe kissed her affectionately and went away. His wife threw him a few\\nkisses and waved her handkerchief. The whistle sounded, and the train\\nstarted.\\n\\nAt that precise moment, and despite the protests of the guards, the door\\nwas opened, and a man rushed into our compartment. My companion, who\\nwas standing and arranging her luggage, uttered a cry of terror and fell\\nupon the seat. I am not a coward--far from it--but I confess that such\\nintrusions at the last minute are always disconcerting. They have a\\nsuspicious, unnatural aspect.\\n\\nHowever, the appearance of the new arrival greatly modified the\\nunfavorable impression produced by his precipitant action. He was\\ncorrectly and elegantly dressed, wore a tasteful cravat, correct gloves,\\nand his face was refined and intelligent. But, where the devil had I\\nseen that face before? Because, beyond all possible doubt, I had seen\\nit. And yet the memory of it was so vague and indistinct that I felt it\\nwould be useless to try to recall it at that time.\\n\\nThen, directing my attention to the lady, I was amazed at the pallor\\nand anxiety I saw in her face. She was looking at her neighbor--they\\noccupied seats on the same side of the compartment--with an expression\\nof intense alarm, and I perceived that one of her trembling hands was\\nslowly gliding toward a little traveling bag that was lying on the seat\\nabout twenty inches from her. She finished by seizing it and nervously\\ndrawing it to her. Our eyes met, and I read in hers so much anxiety and\\nfear that I could not refrain from speaking to her:\\n\\n“Are you ill, madame? Shall I open the window?”\\n\\nHer only reply was a gesture indicating that she was afraid of our\\ncompanion. I smiled, as her husband had done, shrugged my shoulders, and\\nexplained to her, in pantomime, that she had nothing to fear, that I\\nwas there, and, besides, the gentleman appeared to be a very harmless\\nindividual. At that moment, he turned toward us, scrutinized both of us\\nfrom head to foot, then settled down in his corner and paid us no more\\nattention.\\n\\nAfter a short silence, the lady, as if she had mustered all her energy\\nto perform a desperate act, said to me, in an almost inaudible voice:\\n\\n“Do you know who is on our train?”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“He.... he....I assure you....”\\n\\n“Who is he?”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin!”\\n\\nShe had not taken her eyes off our companion, and it was to him rather\\nthan to me that she uttered the syllables of that disquieting name.\\nHe drew his hat over his face. Was that to conceal his agitation or,\\nsimply, to arrange himself for sleep? Then I said to her:\\n\\n“Yesterday, through contumacy, Arsène Lupin was sentenced to twenty\\nyears’ imprisonment at hard labor. Therefore it is improbable that he\\nwould be so imprudent, to-day, as to show himself in public. Moreover,\\nthe newspapers have announced his appearance in Turkey since his escape\\nfrom the Santé.”\\n\\n“But he is on this train at the present moment,” the lady proclaimed,\\nwith the obvious intention of being heard by our companion; “my husband\\nis one of the directors in the penitentiary service, and it was the\\nstationmaster himself who told us that a search was being made for\\nArsène Lupin.”\\n\\n“They may have been mistaken---”\\n\\n“No; he was seen in the waiting-room. He bought a first-class ticket for\\nRouen.”\\n\\n“He has disappeared. The guard at the waiting-room door did not see him\\npass, and it is supposed that he had got into the express that leaves\\nten minutes after us.”\\n\\n“In that case, they will be sure to catch him.”\\n\\n“Unless, at the last moment, he leaped from that train to come here,\\ninto our train.... which is quite probable.... which is almost certain.”\\n\\n“If so, he will be arrested just the same; for the employees and guards\\nwould no doubt observe his passage from one train to the other, and,\\nwhen we arrive at Rouen, they will arrest him there.”\\n\\n“Him--never! He will find some means of escape.”\\n\\n“In that case, I wish him ‘bon voyage.’”\\n\\n“But, in the meantime, think what he may do!”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. He may do anything.”\\n\\nShe was greatly agitated, and, truly, the situation justified, to some\\nextent, her nervous excitement. I was impelled to say to her:\\n\\n“Of course, there are many strange coincidences, but you need have no\\nfear. Admitting that Arsène Lupin is on this train, he will not commit\\nany indiscretion; he will be only too happy to escape the peril that\\nalready threatens him.”\\n\\nMy words did not reassure her, but she remained silent for a time. I\\nunfolded my newspapers and read reports of Arsène Lupin’s trial, but, as\\nthey contained nothing that was new to me, I was not greatly interested.\\nMoreover, I was tired and sleepy. I felt my eyelids close and my head\\ndrop.\\n\\n“But, monsieur, you are not going to sleep!”\\n\\nShe seized my newspaper, and looked at me with indignation.\\n\\n“Certainly not,” I said.\\n\\n“That would be very imprudent.”\\n\\n“Of course,” I assented.\\n\\nI struggled to keep awake. I looked through the window at the landscape\\nand the fleeting clouds, but in a short time all that became confused\\nand indistinct; the image of the nervous lady and the drowsy gentleman\\nwere effaced from my memory, and I was buried in the soothing depths of\\na profound sleep. The tranquility of my response was soon disturbed by\\ndisquieting dreams, wherein a creature that had played the part and bore\\nthe name of Arsène Lupin held an important place. He appeared to me\\nwith his back laden with articles of value; he leaped over walls, and\\nplundered castles. But the outlines of that creature, who was no longer\\nArsène Lupin, assumed a more definite form. He came toward me, growing\\nlarger and larger, leaped into the compartment with incredible agility,\\nand landed squarely on my chest. With a cry of fright and pain, I awoke.\\nThe man, the traveller, our companion, with his knee on my breast, held\\nme by the throat.\\n\\nMy sight was very indistinct, for my eyes were suffused with blood.\\nI could see the lady, in a corner of the compartment, convulsed\\nwith fright. I tried even not to resist. Besides, I did not have the\\nstrength. My temples throbbed; I was almost strangled. One minute more,\\nand I would have breathed my last. The man must have realized it, for he\\nrelaxed his grip, but did not remove his hand. Then he took a cord, in\\nwhich he had prepared a slip-knot, and tied my wrists together. In an\\ninstant, I was bound, gagged, and helpless.\\n\\nCertainly, he accomplished the trick with an ease and skill that\\nrevealed the hand of a master; he was, no doubt, a professional thief.\\nNot a word, not a nervous movement; only coolness and audacity. And I\\nwas there, lying on the bench, bound like a mummy, I--Arsène Lupin!\\n\\nIt was anything but a laughing matter, and yet, despite the gravity\\nof the situation, I keenly appreciated the humor and irony that it\\ninvolved. Arsène Lupin seized and bound like a novice! robbed as if I\\nwere an unsophisticated rustic--for, you must understand, the scoundrel\\nhad deprived me of my purse and wallet! Arsène Lupin, a victim, duped,\\nvanquished....What an adventure!\\n\\nThe lady did not move. He did not even notice her. He contented himself\\nwith picking up her traveling-bag that had fallen to the floor and\\ntaking from it the jewels, purse, and gold and silver trinkets that it\\ncontained. The lady opened her eyes, trembled with fear, drew the rings\\nfrom her fingers and handed them to the man as if she wished to spare\\nhim unnecessary trouble. He took the rings and looked at her. She\\nswooned.\\n\\nThen, quite unruffled, he resumed his seat, lighted a cigarette, and\\nproceeded to examine the treasure that he had acquired. The examination\\nappeared to give him perfect satisfaction.\\n\\nBut I was not so well satisfied. I do not speak of the twelve thousand\\nfrancs of which I had been unduly deprived: that was only a temporary\\nloss, because I was certain that I would recover possession of that\\nmoney after a very brief delay, together with the important papers\\ncontained in my wallet: plans, specifications, addresses, lists of\\ncorrespondents, and compromising letters. But, for the moment, a more\\nimmediate and more serious question troubled me: How would this affair\\nend? What would be the outcome of this adventure?\\n\\nAs you can imagine, the disturbance created by my passage through the\\nSaint-Lazare station has not escaped my notice. Going to visit friends\\nwho knew me under the name of Guillaume Berlat, and amongst whom my\\nresemblance to Arsène Lupin was a subject of many innocent jests, I\\ncould not assume a disguise, and my presence had been remarked.\\nSo, beyond question, the commissary of police at Rouen, notified by\\ntelegraph, and assisted by numerous agents, would be awaiting the train,\\nwould question all suspicious passengers, and proceed to search the\\ncars.\\n\\nOf course, I had foreseen all that, but it had not disturbed me, as I\\nwas certain that the police of Rouen would not be any shrewder than the\\npolice of Paris and that I could escape recognition; would it not be\\nsufficient for me to carelessly display my card as “député,” thanks\\nto which I had inspired complete confidence in the gate-keeper at\\nSaint-Lazare?--But the situation was greatly changed. I was no longer\\nfree. It was impossible to attempt one of my usual tricks. In one of\\nthe compartments, the commissary of police would find Mon. Arsène Lupin,\\nbound hand and foot, as docile as a lamb, packed up, all ready to be\\ndumped into a prison-van. He would have simply to accept delivery of the\\nparcel, the same as if it were so much merchandise or a basket of fruit\\nand vegetables. Yet, to avoid that shameful dénouement, what could I\\ndo?--bound and gagged, as I was? And the train was rushing on toward\\nRouen, the next and only station.\\n\\nAnother problem was presented, in which I was less interested, but\\nthe solution of which aroused my professional curiosity. What were the\\nintentions of my rascally companion? Of course, if I had been alone, he\\ncould, on our arrival at Rouen, leave the car slowly and fearlessly. But\\nthe lady? As soon as the door of the compartment should be opened, the\\nlady, now so quiet and humble, would scream and call for help. That was\\nthe dilemma that perplexed me! Why had he not reduced her to a helpless\\ncondition similar to mine? That would have given him ample time to\\ndisappear before his double crime was discovered.\\n\\nHe was still smoking, with his eyes fixed upon the window that was\\nnow being streaked with drops of rain. Once he turned, picked up my\\ntime-table, and consulted it.\\n\\nThe lady had to feign a continued lack of consciousness in order to\\ndeceive the enemy. But fits of coughing, provoked by the smoke, exposed\\nher true condition. As to me, I was very uncomfortable, and very tired.\\nAnd I meditated; I plotted.\\n\\nThe train was rushing on, joyously, intoxicated with its own speed.\\n\\nSaint Etienne!....At that moment, the man arose and took two steps\\ntoward us, which caused the lady to utter a cry of alarm and fall into\\na genuine swoon. What was the man about to do? He lowered the window\\non our side. A heavy rain was now falling, and, by a gesture, the man\\nexpressed his annoyance at his not having an umbrella or an overcoat. He\\nglanced at the rack. The lady’s umbrella was there. He took it. He also\\ntook my overcoat and put it on.\\n\\nWe were now crossing the Seine. He turned up the bottoms of his\\ntrousers, then leaned over and raised the exterior latch of the door.\\nWas he going to throw himself upon the track? At that speed, it would\\nhave been instant death. We now entered a tunnel. The man opened the\\ndoor half-way and stood on the upper step. What folly! The darkness, the\\nsmoke, the noise, all gave a fantastic appearance to his actions. But\\nsuddenly, the train diminished its speed. A moment later it increased\\nits speed, then slowed up again. Probably, some repairs were being made\\nin that part of the tunnel which obliged the trains to diminish their\\nspeed, and the man was aware of the fact. He immediately stepped down to\\nthe lower step, closed the door behind him, and leaped to the ground. He\\nwas gone.\\n\\nThe lady immediately recovered her wits, and her first act was to lament\\nthe loss of her jewels. I gave her an imploring look. She understood,\\nand quickly removed the gag that stifled me. She wished to untie the\\ncords that bound me, but I prevented her.\\n\\n“No, no, the police must see everything exactly as it stands. I want\\nthem to see what the rascal did to us.”\\n\\n“Suppose I pull the alarm-bell?”\\n\\n“Too late. You should have done that when he made the attack on me.”\\n\\n“But he would have killed me. Ah! monsieur, didn’t I tell you that he\\nwas on this train. I recognized him from his portrait. And now he has\\ngone off with my jewels.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry. The police will catch him.”\\n\\n“Catch Arsène Lupin! Never.”\\n\\n“That depends on you, madame. Listen. When we arrive at Rouen, be at the\\ndoor and call. Make a noise. The police and the railway employees will\\ncome. Tell what you have seen: the assault made on me and the flight of\\nArsène Lupin. Give a description of him--soft hat, umbrella--yours--gray\\novercoat....”\\n\\n“Yours,” said she.\\n\\n“What! mine? Not at all. It was his. I didn’t have any.”\\n\\n“It seems to me he didn’t have one when he came in.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes.... unless the coat was one that some one had forgotten and\\nleft in the rack. At all events, he had it when he went away, and that\\nis the essential point. A gray overcoat--remember!....Ah! I forgot.\\nYou must tell your name, first thing you do. Your husband’s official\\nposition will stimulate the zeal of the police.”\\n\\nWe arrived at the station. I gave her some further instructions in a\\nrather imperious tone:\\n\\n“Tell them my name--Guillaume Berlat. If necessary, say that you know\\nme. That will save time. We must expedite the preliminary investigation.\\nThe important thing is the pursuit of Arsène Lupin. Your jewels,\\nremember! Let there be no mistake. Guillaume Berlat, a friend of your\\nhusband.”\\n\\n“I understand....Guillaume Berlat.”\\n\\nShe was already calling and gesticulating. As soon as the train stopped,\\nseveral men entered the compartment. The critical moment had come.\\n\\nPanting for breath, the lady exclaimed:\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin.... he attacked us.... he stole my jewels....I am Madame\\nRenaud.... my husband is a director of the penitentiary service....Ah!\\nhere is my brother, Georges Ardelle, director of the Crédit\\nRouennais.... you must know....”\\n\\nShe embraced a young man who had just joined us, and whom the commissary\\nsaluted. Then she continued, weeping:\\n\\n“Yes, Arsène Lupin.... while monsieur was sleeping, he seized him by the\\nthroat....Mon. Berlat, a friend of my husband.”\\n\\nThe commissary asked:\\n\\n“But where is Arsène Lupin?”\\n\\n“He leaped from the train, when passing through the tunnel.”\\n\\n“Are you sure that it was he?”\\n\\n“Am I sure! I recognized him perfectly. Besides, he was seen at the\\nSaint-Lazare station. He wore a soft hat---”\\n\\n“No, a hard felt, like that,” said the commissary, pointing to my hat.\\n\\n“He had a soft hat, I am sure,” repeated Madame Renaud, “and a gray\\novercoat.”\\n\\n“Yes, that is right,” replied the commissary, “the telegram says he wore\\na gray overcoat with a black velvet collar.”\\n\\n“Exactly, a black velvet collar,” exclaimed Madame Renaud, triumphantly.\\n\\nI breathed freely. Ah! the excellent friend I had in that little woman.\\n\\nThe police agents had now released me. I bit my lips until they ran\\nblood. Stooping over, with my handkerchief over my mouth, an attitude\\nquite natural in a person who has remained for a long time in an\\nuncomfortable position, and whose mouth shows the bloody marks of the\\ngag, I addressed the commissary, in a weak voice:\\n\\n“Monsieur, it was Arsène Lupin. There is no doubt about that. If we make\\nhaste, he can be caught yet. I think I may be of some service to you.”\\n\\nThe railway car, in which the crime occurred, was detached from the\\ntrain to serve as a mute witness at the official investigation. The\\ntrain continued on its way to Havre. We were then conducted to the\\nstation-master’s office through a crowd of curious spectators.\\n\\nThen, I had a sudden access of doubt and discretion. Under some pretext\\nor other, I must gain my automobile, and escape. To remain there was\\ndangerous. Something might happen; for instance, a telegram from Paris,\\nand I would be lost.\\n\\nYes, but what about my thief? Abandoned to my own resources, in an\\nunfamiliar country, I could not hope to catch him.\\n\\n“Bah! I must make the attempt,” I said to myself. “It may be a difficult\\ngame, but an amusing one, and the stake is well worth the trouble.”\\n\\nAnd when the commissary asked us to repeat the story of the robbery, I\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n“Monsieur, really, Arsène Lupin is getting the start of us. My\\nautomobile is waiting in the courtyard. If you will be so kind as to use\\nit, we can try....”\\n\\nThe commissary smiled, and replied:\\n\\n“The idea is a good one; so good, indeed, that it is already being\\ncarried out. Two of my men have set out on bicycles. They have been gone\\nfor some time.”\\n\\n“Where did they go?”\\n\\n“To the entrance of the tunnel. There, they will gather evidence, secure\\nwitnesses, and follow on the track of Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\nI could not refrain from shrugging my shoulders, as I replied:\\n\\n“Your men will not secure any evidence or any witnesses.”\\n\\n“Really!”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin will not allow anyone to see him emerge from the tunnel.\\nHe will take the first road---”\\n\\n“To Rouen, where we will arrest him.”\\n\\n“He will not go to Rouen.”\\n\\n“Then he will remain in the vicinity, where his capture will be even\\nmore certain.”\\n\\n“He will not remain in the vicinity.”\\n\\n“Oh! oh! And where will he hide?”\\n\\nI looked at my watch, and said:\\n\\n“At the present moment, Arsène Lupin is prowling around the station at\\nDarnétal. At ten fifty, that is, in twenty-two minutes from now, he will\\ntake the train that goes from Rouen to Amiens.”\\n\\n“Do you think so? How do you know it?”\\n\\n“Oh! it is quite simple. While we were in the car, Arsène Lupin\\nconsulted my railway guide. Why did he do it? Was there, not far from\\nthe spot where he disappeared, another line of railway, a station\\nupon that line, and a train stopping at that station? On consulting my\\nrailway guide, I found such to be the case.”\\n\\n“Really, monsieur,” said the commissary, “that is a marvelous deduction.\\nI congratulate you on your skill.”\\n\\nI was now convinced that I had made a mistake in displaying so much\\ncleverness. The commissary regarded me with astonishment, and I thought\\na slight suspicion entered his official mind....Oh! scarcely that, for\\nthe photographs distributed broadcast by the police department were too\\nimperfect; they presented an Arsène Lupin so different from the one he\\nhad before him, that he could not possibly recognize me by it. But, all\\nthe same, he was troubled, confused and ill-at-ease.\\n\\n“Mon Dieu! nothing stimulates the comprehension so much as the loss of a\\npocketbook and the desire to recover it. And it seems to me that if you\\nwill give me two of your men, we may be able....”\\n\\n“Oh! I beg of you, monsieur le commissaire,” cried Madame Renaud,\\n“listen to Mon. Berlat.”\\n\\nThe intervention of my excellent friend was decisive. Pronounced by her,\\nthe wife of an influential official, the name of Berlat became really\\nmy own, and gave me an identity that no mere suspicion could affect. The\\ncommissary arose, and said:\\n\\n“Believe me, Monsieur Berlat, I shall be delighted to see you succeed. I\\nam as much interested as you are in the arrest of Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\nHe accompanied me to the automobile, and introduced two of his men,\\nHonoré Massol and Gaston Delivet, who were assigned to assist me. My\\nchauffer cranked up the car and I took my place at the wheel. A few\\nseconds later, we left the station. I was saved.\\n\\nAh! I must confess that in rolling over the boulevards that surrounded\\nthe old Norman city, in my swift thirty-five horse-power Moreau-Lepton,\\nI experienced a deep feeling of pride, and the motor responded,\\nsympathetically to my desires. At right and left, the trees flew past\\nus with startling rapidity, and I, free, out of danger, had simply to\\narrange my little personal affairs with the two honest representatives\\nof the Rouen police who were sitting behind me. Arsène Lupin was going\\nin search of Arsène Lupin!\\n\\nModest guardians of social order--Gaston Delivet and Honoré Massol--how\\nvaluable was your assistance! What would I have done without you?\\nWithout you, many times, at the cross-roads, I might have taken the\\nwrong route! Without you, Arsène Lupin would have made a mistake, and\\nthe other would have escaped!\\n\\nBut the end was not yet. Far from it. I had yet to capture the thief and\\nrecover the stolen papers. Under no circumstances must my two acolytes\\nbe permitted to see those papers, much less to seize them. That was a\\npoint that might give me some difficulty.\\n\\nWe arrived at Darnétal three minutes after the departure of the train.\\nTrue, I had the consolation of learning that a man wearing a gray\\novercoat with a black velvet collar had taken the train at the station.\\nHe had bought a second-class ticket for Amiens. Certainly, my début as\\ndetective was a promising one.\\n\\nDelivet said to me:\\n\\n“The train is express, and the next stop is Montérolier-Buchy in\\nnineteen minutes. If we do not reach there before Arsène Lupin, he can\\nproceed to Amiens, or change for the train going to Clères, and, from\\nthat point, reach Dieppe or Paris.”\\n\\n“How far to Montérolier?”\\n\\n“Twenty-three kilometres.”\\n\\n“Twenty-three kilometres in nineteen minutes....We will be there ahead\\nof him.”\\n\\nWe were off again! Never had my faithful Moreau-Repton responded to\\nmy impatience with such ardor and regularity. It participated in my\\nanxiety. It indorsed my determination. It comprehended my animosity\\nagainst that rascally Arsène Lupin. The knave! The traitor!\\n\\n“Turn to the right,” cried Delivet, “then to the left.”\\n\\nWe fairly flew, scarcely touching the ground. The mile-stones looked\\nlike little timid beasts that vanished at our approach. Suddenly, at a\\nturn of the road, we saw a vortex of smoke. It was the Northern Express.\\nFor a kilometre, it was a struggle, side by side, but an unequal\\nstruggle in which the issue was certain. We won the race by twenty\\nlengths.\\n\\nIn three seconds we were on the platform standing before the\\nsecond-class carriages. The doors were opened, and some passengers\\nalighted, but not my thief. We made a search through the compartments.\\nNo sign of Arsène Lupin.\\n\\n“Sapristi!” I cried, “he must have recognized me in the automobile as we\\nwere racing, side by side, and he leaped from the train.”\\n\\n“Ah! there he is now! crossing the track.”\\n\\nI started in pursuit of the man, followed by my two acolytes, or rather\\nfollowed by one of them, for the other, Massol, proved himself to be a\\nrunner of exceptional speed and endurance. In a few moments, he had made\\nan appreciable gain upon the fugitive. The man noticed it, leaped over\\na hedge, scampered across a meadow, and entered a thick grove. When we\\nreached this grove, Massol was waiting for us. He went no farther, for\\nfear of losing us.\\n\\n“Quite right, my dear friend,” I said. “After such a run, our victim\\nmust be out of wind. We will catch him now.”\\n\\nI examined the surroundings with the idea of proceeding alone in the\\narrest of the fugitive, in order to recover my papers, concerning which\\nthe authorities would doubtless ask many disagreeable questions. Then I\\nreturned to my companions, and said:\\n\\n“It is all quite easy. You, Massol, take your place at the left; you,\\nDelivet, at the right. From there, you can observe the entire posterior\\nline of the bush, and he cannot escape without you seeing him, except by\\nthat ravine, and I shall watch it. If he does not come out voluntarily,\\nI will enter and drive him out toward one or the other of you. You have\\nsimply to wait. Ah! I forgot: in case I need you, a pistol shot.”\\n\\nMassol and Delivet walked away to their respective posts. As soon as\\nthey had disappeared, I entered the grove with the greatest precaution\\nso as to be neither seen nor heard. I encountered dense thickets,\\nthrough which narrow paths had been cut, but the overhanging boughs\\ncompelled me to adopt a stooping posture. One of these paths led to a\\nclearing in which I found footsteps upon the wet grass. I followed them;\\nthey led me to the foot of a mound which was surmounted by a deserted,\\ndilapidated hovel.\\n\\n“He must be there,” I said to myself. “It is a well-chosen retreat.”\\n\\nI crept cautiously to the side of the building. A slight noise informed\\nme that he was there; and, then, through an opening, I saw him. His back\\nwas turned toward me. In two bounds, I was upon him. He tried to fire\\na revolver that he held in his hand. But he had no time. I threw him to\\nthe ground, in such a manner that his arms were beneath him, twisted and\\nhelpless, whilst I held him down with my knee on his breast.\\n\\n“Listen, my boy,” I whispered in his ear. “I am Arsène Lupin. You are\\nto deliver over to me, immediately and gracefully, my pocketbook and the\\nlady’s jewels, and, in return therefore, I will save you from the police\\nand enroll you amongst my friends. One word: yes or no?”\\n\\n“Yes,” he murmured.\\n\\n“Very good. Your escape, this morning, was well planned. I congratulate\\nyou.”\\n\\nI arose. He fumbled in his pocket, drew out a large knife and tried to\\nstrike me with it.\\n\\n“Imbecile!” I exclaimed.\\n\\nWith one hand, I parried the attack; with the other, I gave him a sharp\\nblow on the carotid artery. He fell--stunned!\\n\\nIn my pocketbook, I recovered my papers and bank-notes. Out of\\ncuriosity, I took his. Upon an envelope, addressed to him, I read his\\nname: Pierre Onfrey. It startled me. Pierre Onfrey, the assassin of the\\nrue Lafontaine at Auteuil! Pierre Onfrey, he who had cut the throats of\\nMadame Delbois and her two daughters. I leaned over him. Yes, those were\\nthe features which, in the compartment, had evoked in me the memory of a\\nface I could not then recall.\\n\\nBut time was passing. I placed in an envelope two bank-notes of one\\nhundred francs each, with a card bearing these words: “Arsène Lupin\\nto his worthy colleagues Honoré Massol and Gaston Delivet, as a slight\\ntoken of his gratitude.” I placed it in a prominent spot in the room,\\nwhere they would be sure to find it. Beside it, I placed Madame Renaud’s\\nhandbag. Why could I not return it to the lady who had befriended me?\\nI must confess that I had taken from it everything that possessed any\\ninterest or value, leaving there only a shell comb, a stick of rouge\\nDorin for the lips, and an empty purse. But, you know, business\\nis business. And then, really, her husband is engaged in such a\\ndishonorable vocation!\\n\\nThe man was becoming conscious. What was I to do? I was unable to save\\nhim or condemn him. So I took his revolver and fired a shot in the air.\\n\\n“My two acolytes will come and attend to his case,” I said to myself, as\\nI hastened away by the road through the ravine. Twenty minutes later, I\\nwas seated in my automobile.\\n\\nAt four o’clock, I telegraphed to my friends at Rouen that an unexpected\\nevent would prevent me from making my promised visit. Between ourselves,\\nconsidering what my friends must now know, my visit is postponed\\nindefinitely. A cruel disillusion for them!\\n\\nAt six o’clock I was in Paris. The evening newspapers informed me that\\nPierre Onfrey had been captured at last.\\n\\nNext day,--let us not despise the advantages of judicious\\nadvertising,--the _Echo de France_ published this sensational item:\\n\\n“Yesterday, near Buchy, after numerous exciting incidents, Arsène Lupin\\neffected the arrest of Pierre Onfrey. The assassin of the rue Lafontaine\\nhad robbed Madame Renaud, wife of the director in the penitentiary\\nservice, in a railway carriage on the Paris-Havre line. Arsène Lupin\\nrestored to Madame Renaud the hand-bag that contained her jewels, and\\ngave a generous recompense to the two detectives who had assisted him in\\nmaking that dramatic arrest.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. The Queen’s Necklace\\n\\n\\nTwo or three times each year, on occasions of unusual importance,\\nsuch as the balls at the Austrian Embassy or the soirées of Lady\\nBillingstone, the Countess de Dreux-Soubise wore upon her white\\nshoulders “The Queen’s Necklace.”\\n\\nIt was, indeed, the famous necklace, the legendary necklace that\\nBohmer and Bassenge, court jewelers, had made for Madame Du Barry; the\\nveritable necklace that the Cardinal de Rohan-Soubise intended to give\\nto Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France; and the same that the adventuress\\nJeanne de Valois, Countess de la Motte, had pulled to pieces one evening\\nin February, 1785, with the aid of her husband and their accomplice,\\nRétaux de Villette.\\n\\nTo tell the truth, the mounting alone was genuine. Rétaux de Villette\\nhad kept it, whilst the Count de la Motte and his wife scattered to the\\nfour winds of heaven the beautiful stones so carefully chosen by Bohmer.\\nLater, he sold the mounting to Gaston de Dreux-Soubise, nephew and heir\\nof the Cardinal, who re-purchased the few diamonds that remained in\\nthe possession of the English jeweler, Jeffreys; supplemented them with\\nother stones of the same size but of much inferior quality, and thus\\nrestored the marvelous necklace to the form in which it had come from\\nthe hands of Bohmer and Bassenge.\\n\\nFor nearly a century, the house of Dreux-Soubise had prided itself upon\\nthe possession of this historic jewel. Although adverse circumstances\\nhad greatly reduced their fortune, they preferred to curtail their\\nhousehold expenses rather than part with this relic of royalty. More\\nparticularly, the present count clung to it as a man clings to the\\nhome of his ancestors. As a matter of prudence, he had rented a\\nsafety-deposit box at the Crédit Lyonnais in which to keep it. He went\\nfor it himself on the afternoon of the day on which his wife wished to\\nwear it, and he, himself, carried it back next morning.\\n\\nOn this particular evening, at the reception given at the Palais\\nde Castille, the Countess achieved a remarkable success; and King\\nChristian, in whose honor the fête was given, commented on her grace\\nand beauty. The thousand facets of the diamond sparkled and shone like\\nflames of fire about her shapely neck and shoulders, and it is safe to\\nsay that none but she could have borne the weight of such an ornament\\nwith so much ease and grace.\\n\\nThis was a double triumph, and the Count de Dreux was highly elated\\nwhen they returned to their chamber in the old house of the faubourg\\nSaint-Germain. He was proud of his wife, and quite as proud, perhaps,\\nof the necklace that had conferred added luster to his noble house\\nfor generations. His wife, also, regarded the necklace with an almost\\nchildish vanity, and it was not without regret that she removed it\\nfrom her shoulders and handed it to her husband who admired it as\\npassionately as if he had never seen it before. Then, having placed it\\nin its case of red leather, stamped with the Cardinal’s arms, he passed\\ninto an adjoining room which was simply an alcove or cabinet that had\\nbeen cut off from their chamber, and which could be entered only by\\nmeans of a door at the foot of their bed. As he had done on previous\\noccasions, he hid it on a high shelf amongst hat-boxes and piles of\\nlinen. He closed the door, and retired.\\n\\nNext morning, he arose about nine o’clock, intending to go to the Crédit\\nLyonnais before breakfast. He dressed, drank a cup of coffee, and went\\nto the stables to give his orders. The condition of one of the horses\\nworried him. He caused it to be exercised in his presence. Then he\\nreturned to his wife, who had not yet left the chamber. Her maid was\\ndressing her hair. When her husband entered, she asked:\\n\\n“Are you going out?”\\n\\n“Yes, as far as the bank.”\\n\\n“Of course. That is wise.”\\n\\nHe entered the cabinet; but, after a few seconds, and without any sign\\nof astonishment, he asked:\\n\\n“Did you take it, my dear?”\\n\\n“What?....No, I have not taken anything.”\\n\\n“You must have moved it.”\\n\\n“Not at all. I have not even opened that door.”\\n\\nHe appeared at the door, disconcerted, and stammered, in a scarcely\\nintelligible voice:\\n\\n“You haven’t....It wasn’t you?....Then....”\\n\\nShe hastened to his assistance, and, together, they made a thorough\\nsearch, throwing the boxes to the floor and overturning the piles of\\nlinen. Then the count said, quite discouraged:\\n\\n“It is useless to look any more. I put it here, on this shelf.”\\n\\n“You must be mistaken.”\\n\\n“No, no, it was on this shelf--nowhere else.”\\n\\nThey lighted a candle, as the room was quite dark, and then carried out\\nall the linen and other articles that the room contained. And, when the\\nroom was emptied, they confessed, in despair, that the famous necklace\\nhad disappeared. Without losing time in vain lamentations, the countess\\nnotified the commissary of police, Mon. Valorbe, who came at once, and,\\nafter hearing their story, inquired of the count:\\n\\n“Are you sure that no one passed through your chamber during the night?”\\n\\n“Absolutely sure, as I am a very light sleeper. Besides, the chamber\\ndoor was bolted, and I remember unbolting it this morning when my wife\\nrang for her maid.”\\n\\n“And there is no other entrance to the cabinet?”\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n“No windows?”\\n\\n“Yes, but it is closed up.”\\n\\n“I will look at it.”\\n\\nCandles were lighted, and Mon. Valorbe observed at once that the lower\\nhalf of the window was covered by a large press which was, however, so\\nnarrow that it did not touch the casement on either side.\\n\\n“On what does this window open?”\\n\\n“A small inner court.”\\n\\n“And you have a floor above this?”\\n\\n“Two; but, on a level with the servant’s floor, there is a close grating\\nover the court. That is why this room is so dark.”\\n\\nWhen the press was moved, they found that the window was fastened, which\\nwould not have been the case if anyone had entered that way.\\n\\n“Unless,” said the count, “they went out through our chamber.”\\n\\n“In that case, you would have found the door unbolted.”\\n\\nThe commissary considered the situation for a moment, then asked the\\ncountess:\\n\\n“Did any of your servants know that you wore the necklace last evening?”\\n\\n“Certainly; I didn’t conceal the fact. But nobody knew that it was\\nhidden in that cabinet.”\\n\\n“No one?”\\n\\n“No one.... unless....”\\n\\n“Be quite sure, madam, as it is a very important point.”\\n\\nShe turned to her husband, and said:\\n\\n“I was thinking of Henriette.”\\n\\n“Henriette? She didn’t know where we kept it.”\\n\\n“Are you sure?”\\n\\n“Who is this woman Henriette?” asked Mon. Valorbe.\\n\\n“A school-mate, who was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her.\\nAfter her husband’s death, I furnished an apartment in this house for\\nher and her son. She is clever with her needle and has done some work\\nfor me.”\\n\\n“What floor is she on?”\\n\\n“Same as ours.... at the end of the corridor.... and I think.... the\\nwindow of her kitchen....”\\n\\n“Opens on this little court, does it not?”\\n\\n“Yes, just opposite ours.”\\n\\nMon. Valorbe then asked to see Henriette. They went to her apartment;\\nshe was sewing, whilst her son Raoul, about six years old, was sitting\\nbeside her, reading. The commissary was surprised to see the wretched\\napartment that had been provided for the woman. It consisted of one room\\nwithout a fireplace, and a very small room that served as a kitchen. The\\ncommissary proceeded to question her. She appeared to be overwhelmed on\\nlearning of the theft. Last evening she had herself dressed the countess\\nand placed the necklace upon her shoulders.\\n\\n“Good God!” she exclaimed, “it can’t be possible!”\\n\\n“And you have no idea? Not the least suspicion? Is it possible that the\\nthief may have passed through your room?”\\n\\nShe laughed heartily, never supposing that she could be an object of\\nsuspicion.\\n\\n“But I have not left my room. I never go out. And, perhaps, you have not\\nseen?”\\n\\nShe opened the kitchen window, and said:\\n\\n“See, it is at least three metres to the ledge of the opposite window.”\\n\\n“Who told you that we supposed the theft might have been committed in\\nthat way?”\\n\\n“But.... the necklace was in the cabinet, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n“How do you know that?”\\n\\n“Why, I have always known that it was kept there at night. It had been\\nmentioned in my presence.”\\n\\nHer face, though still young, bore unmistakable traces of sorrow and\\nresignation. And it now assumed an expression of anxiety as if some\\ndanger threatened her. She drew her son toward her. The child took her\\nhand, and kissed it affectionately.\\n\\nWhen they were alone again, the count said to the commissary:\\n\\n“I do not suppose you suspect Henriette. I can answer for her. She is\\nhonesty itself.”\\n\\n“I quite agree with you,” replied Mon. Valorbe. “At most, I thought\\nthere might have been an unconscious complicity. But I confess that even\\nthat theory must be abandoned, as it does not help solve the problem now\\nbefore us.”\\n\\nThe commissary of police abandoned the investigation, which was now\\ntaken up and completed by the examining judge. He questioned the\\nservants, examined the condition of the bolt, experimented with the\\nopening and closing of the cabinet window, and explored the little court\\nfrom top to bottom. All was in vain. The bolt was intact. The window\\ncould not be opened or closed from the outside.\\n\\nThe inquiries especially concerned Henriette, for, in spite of\\neverything, they always turned in her direction. They made a thorough\\ninvestigation of her past life, and ascertained that, during the last\\nthree years, she had left the house only four times, and her business,\\non those occasions, was satisfactorily explained. As a matter of fact,\\nshe acted as chambermaid and seamstress to the countess, who treated her\\nwith great strictness and even severity.\\n\\nAt the end of a week, the examining judge had secured no more definite\\ninformation than the commissary of police. The judge said:\\n\\n“Admitting that we know the guilty party, which we do not, we are\\nconfronted by the fact that we do not know how the theft was\\ncommitted. We are brought face to face with two obstacles: a door and a\\nwindow--both closed and fastened. It is thus a double mystery. How could\\nanyone enter, and, moreover, how could any one escape, leaving behind\\nhim a bolted door and a fastened window?”\\n\\nAt the end of four months, the secret opinion of the judge was that the\\ncount and countess, being hard pressed for money, which was their normal\\ncondition, had sold the Queen’s Necklace. He closed the investigation.\\n\\nThe loss of the famous jewel was a severe blow to the Dreux-Soubise.\\nTheir credit being no longer propped up by the reserve fund that such a\\ntreasure constituted, they found themselves confronted by more exacting\\ncreditors and money-lenders. They were obliged to cut down to the quick,\\nto sell or mortgage every article that possessed any commercial value.\\nIn brief, it would have been their ruin, if two large legacies from some\\ndistant relatives had not saved them.\\n\\nTheir pride also suffered a downfall, as if they had lost a quartering\\nfrom their escutcheon. And, strange to relate, it was upon her former\\nschoolmate, Henriette, that the countess vented her spleen. Toward\\nher, the countess displayed the most spiteful feelings, and even openly\\naccused her. First, Henriette was relegated to the servants’ quarters,\\nand, next day, discharged.\\n\\nFor some time, the count and countess passed an uneventful life. They\\ntraveled a great deal. Only one incident of record occurred during that\\nperiod. Some months after the departure of Henriette, the countess was\\nsurprised when she received and read the following letter, signed by\\nHenriette:\\n\\n“Madame,”\\n\\n“I do not know how to thank you; for it was you, was it not,\\nwho sent me that? It could not have been anyone else. No one but you\\nknows where I live. If I am wrong, excuse me, and accept my sincere\\nthanks for your past favors....”\\n\\nWhat did the letter mean? The present or past favors of the countess\\nconsisted principally of injustice and neglect. Why, then, this letter\\nof thanks?\\n\\nWhen asked for an explanation, Henriette replied that she had received\\na letter, through the mails, enclosing two bank-notes of one thousand\\nfrancs each. The envelope, which she enclosed with her reply, bore the\\nParis post-mark, and was addressed in a handwriting that was obviously\\ndisguised. Now, whence came those two thousand francs? Who had sent\\nthem? And why had they sent them?\\n\\nHenriette received a similar letter and a like sum of money twelve\\nmonths later. And a third time; and a fourth; and each year for a period\\nof six years, with this difference, that in the fifth and sixth years\\nthe sum was doubled. There was another difference: the post-office\\nauthorities having seized one of the letters under the pretext that it\\nwas not registered, the last two letters were duly sent according to the\\npostal regulations, the first dated from Saint-Germain, the other from\\nSuresnes. The writer signed the first one, “Anquety”; and the other,\\n“Péchard.” The addresses that he gave were false.\\n\\nAt the end of six years, Henriette died, and the mystery remained\\nunsolved.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nAll these events are known to the public. The case was one of those\\nwhich excite public interest, and it was a strange coincidence that this\\nnecklace, which had caused such a great commotion in France at the close\\nof the eighteenth century, should create a similar commotion a century\\nlater. But what I am about to relate is known only to the parties\\ndirectly interested and a few others from whom the count exacted a\\npromise of secrecy. As it is probable that some day or other that\\npromise will be broken, I have no hesitation in rending the veil and\\nthus disclosing the key to the mystery, the explanation of the letter\\npublished in the morning papers two days ago; an extraordinary letter\\nwhich increased, if possible, the mists and shadows that envelope this\\ninscrutable drama.\\n\\nFive days ago, a number of guests were dining with the Count de\\nDreux-Soubise. There were several ladies present, including his two\\nnieces and his cousin, and the following gentlemen: the president of\\nEssaville, the deputy Bochas, the chevalier Floriani, whom the count had\\nknown in Sicily, and General Marquis de Rouzières, an old club friend.\\n\\nAfter the repast, coffee was served by the ladies, who gave the\\ngentlemen permission to smoke their cigarettes, provided they would not\\ndesert the salon. The conversation was general, and finally one of the\\nguests chanced to speak of celebrated crimes. And that gave the Marquis\\nde Rouzières, who delighted to tease the count, an opportunity to\\nmention the affair of the Queen’s Necklace, a subject that the count\\ndetested.\\n\\nEach one expressed his own opinion of the affair; and, of course, their\\nvarious theories were not only contradictory but impossible.\\n\\n“And you, monsieur,” said the countess to the chevalier Floriani, “what\\nis your opinion?”\\n\\n“Oh! I--I have no opinion, madame.”\\n\\nAll the guests protested; for the chevalier had just related in an\\nentertaining manner various adventures in which he had participated with\\nhis father, a magistrate at Palermo, and which established his judgment\\nand taste in such manners.\\n\\n“I confess,” said he, “I have sometimes succeeded in unraveling\\nmysteries that the cleverest detectives have renounced; yet I do not\\nclaim to be Sherlock Holmes. Moreover, I know very little about the\\naffair of the Queen’s Necklace.”\\n\\nEverybody now turned to the count, who was thus obliged, quite\\nunwillingly, to narrate all the circumstances connected with the theft.\\nThe chevalier listened, reflected, asked a few questions, and said:\\n\\n“It is very strange.... at first sight, the problem appears to be a very\\nsimple one.”\\n\\nThe count shrugged his shoulders. The others drew closer to the\\nchevalier, who continued, in a dogmatic tone:\\n\\n“As a general rule, in order to find the author of a crime or a theft,\\nit is necessary to determine how that crime or theft was committed, or,\\nat least, how it could have been committed. In the present case, nothing\\nis more simple, because we are face to face, not with several theories,\\nbut with one positive fact, that is to say: the thief could only enter\\nby the chamber door or the window of the cabinet. Now, a person cannot\\nopen a bolted door from the outside. Therefore, he must have entered\\nthrough the window.”\\n\\n“But it was closed and fastened, and we found it fastened afterward,”\\n declared the count.\\n\\n“In order to do that,” continued Floriani, without heeding the\\ninterruption, “he had simply to construct a bridge, a plank or a ladder,\\nbetween the balcony of the kitchen and the ledge of the window, and as\\nthe jewel-case---”\\n\\n“But I repeat that the window was fastened,” exclaimed the count,\\nimpatiently.\\n\\nThis time, Floriani was obliged to reply. He did so with the greatest\\ntranquility, as if the objection was the most insignificant affair in\\nthe world.\\n\\n“I will admit that it was; but is there not a transom in the upper part\\nof the window?”\\n\\n“How do you know that?”\\n\\n“In the first place, that was customary in houses of that date; and,\\nin the second place, without such a transom, the theft cannot be\\nexplained.”\\n\\n“Yes, there is one, but it was closed, the same as the window.\\nConsequently, we did not pay attention to it.”\\n\\n“That was a mistake; for, if you had examined it, you would have found\\nthat it had been opened.”\\n\\n“But how?”\\n\\n“I presume that, like all others, it opens by means of a wire with a\\nring on the lower end.”\\n\\n“Yes, but I do not see---”\\n\\n“Now, through a hole in the window, a person could, by the aid of some\\ninstrument, let us say a poker with a hook at the end, grip the ring,\\npull down, and open the transom.”\\n\\nThe count laughed and said:\\n\\n“Excellent! excellent! Your scheme is very cleverly constructed, but you\\noverlook one thing, monsieur, there is no hole in the window.”\\n\\n“There was a hole.”\\n\\n“Nonsense, we would have seen it.”\\n\\n“In order to see it, you must look for it, and no one has looked. The\\nhole is there; it must be there, at the side of the window, in the\\nputty. In a vertical direction, of course.”\\n\\nThe count arose. He was greatly excited. He paced up and down the room,\\ntwo or three times, in a nervous manner; then, approaching Floriani,\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Nobody has been in that room since; nothing has been changed.”\\n\\n“Very well, monsieur, you can easily satisfy yourself that my\\nexplanation is correct.”\\n\\n“It does not agree with the facts established by the examining judge.\\nYou have seen nothing, and yet you contradict all that we have seen and\\nall that we know.”\\n\\nFloriani paid no attention to the count’s petulance. He simply smiled\\nand said:\\n\\n“Mon Dieu, monsieur, I submit my theory; that is all. If I am mistaken,\\nyou can easily prove it.”\\n\\n“I will do so at once....I confess that your assurance---”\\n\\nThe count muttered a few more words; then suddenly rushed to the door\\nand passed out. Not a word was uttered in his absence; and this profound\\nsilence gave the situation an air of almost tragic importance. Finally,\\nthe count returned. He was pale and nervous. He said to his friends, in\\na trembling voice:\\n\\n“I beg your pardon.... the revelations of the chevalier were so\\nunexpected....I should never have thought....”\\n\\nHis wife questioned him, eagerly:\\n\\n“Speak.... what is it?”\\n\\nHe stammered: “The hole is there, at the very spot, at the side of the\\nwindow---”\\n\\nHe seized the chevalier’s arm, and said to him in an imperious tone:\\n\\n“Now, monsieur, proceed. I admit that you are right so far, but\\nnow.... that is not all.... go on.... tell us the rest of it.”\\n\\nFloriani disengaged his arm gently, and, after a moment, continued:\\n\\n“Well, in my opinion, this is what happened. The thief, knowing that the\\ncountess was going to wear the necklace that evening, had prepared his\\ngangway or bridge during your absence. He watched you through the window\\nand saw you hide the necklace. Afterward, he cut the glass and pulled\\nthe ring.”\\n\\n“Ah! but the distance was so great that it would be impossible for him\\nto reach the window-fastening through the transom.”\\n\\n“Well, then, if he could not open the window by reaching through the\\ntransom, he must have crawled through the transom.”\\n\\n“Impossible; it is too small. No man could crawl through it.”\\n\\n“Then it was not a man,” declared Floriani.\\n\\n“What!”\\n\\n“If the transom is too small to admit a man, it must have been a child.”\\n\\n“A child!”\\n\\n“Did you not say that your friend Henriette had a son?”\\n\\n“Yes; a son named Raoul.”\\n\\n“Then, in all probability, it was Raoul who committed the theft.”\\n\\n“What proof have you of that?”\\n\\n“What proof! Plenty of it....For instance---”\\n\\nHe stopped, and reflected for a moment, then continued:\\n\\n“For instance, that gangway or bridge. It is improbable that the child\\ncould have brought it in from outside the house and carried it away\\nagain without being observed. He must have used something close at hand.\\nIn the little room used by Henriette as a kitchen, were there not some\\nshelves against the wall on which she placed her pans and dishes?”\\n\\n“Two shelves, to the best of my memory.”\\n\\n“Are you sure that those shelves are really fastened to the wooden\\nbrackets that support them? For, if they are not, we could be justified\\nin presuming that the child removed them, fastened them together, and\\nthus formed his bridge. Perhaps, also, since there was a stove, we might\\nfind the bent poker that he used to open the transom.”\\n\\nWithout saying a word, the count left the room; and, this time, those\\npresent did not feel the nervous anxiety they had experienced the\\nfirst time. They were confident that Floriani was right, and no one was\\nsurprised when the count returned and declared:\\n\\n“It was the child. Everything proves it.”\\n\\n“You have seen the shelves and the poker?”\\n\\n“Yes. The shelves have been unnailed, and the poker is there yet.”\\n\\nBut the countess exclaimed:\\n\\n“You had better say it was his mother. Henriette is the guilty party.\\nShe must have compelled her son---”\\n\\n“No,” declared the chevalier, “the mother had nothing to do with it.”\\n\\n“Nonsense! they occupied the same room. The child could not have done it\\nwithout the mother’s knowledge.”\\n\\n“True, they lived in the same room, but all this happened in the\\nadjoining room, during the night, while the mother was asleep.”\\n\\n“And the necklace?” said the count. “It would have been found amongst\\nthe child’s things.”\\n\\n“Pardon me! He had been out. That morning, on which you found him\\nreading, he had just come from school, and perhaps the commissary of\\npolice, instead of wasting his time on the innocent mother, would\\nhave been better employed in searching the child’s desk amongst his\\nschool-books.”\\n\\n“But how do you explain those two thousand francs that Henriette\\nreceived each year? Are they not evidence of her complicity?”\\n\\n“If she had been an accomplice, would she have thanked you for that\\nmoney? And then, was she not closely watched? But the child, being free,\\ncould easily go to a neighboring city, negotiate with some dealer and\\nsell him one diamond or two diamonds, as he might wish, upon condition\\nthat the money should be sent from Paris, and that proceeding could be\\nrepeated from year to year.”\\n\\nAn indescribable anxiety oppressed the Dreux-Soubise and their guests.\\nThere was something in the tone and attitude of Floriani--something more\\nthan the chevalier’s assurance which, from the beginning, had so annoyed\\nthe count. There was a touch of irony, that seemed rather hostile than\\nsympathetic. But the count affected to laugh, as he said:\\n\\n“All that is very ingenious and interesting, and I congratulate you upon\\nyour vivid imagination.”\\n\\n“No, not at all,” replied Floriani, with the utmost gravity, “I imagine\\nnothing. I simply describe the events as they must have occurred.”\\n\\n“But what do you know about them?”\\n\\n“What you yourself have told me. I picture to myself the life of the\\nmother and child down there in the country; the illness of the mother,\\nthe schemes of and inventions of the child to sell the precious stones in\\norder to save his mother’s life, or, at least, soothe her dying moments.\\nHer illness overcomes her. She dies. Years roll on. The child becomes\\na man; and then--and now I will give my imagination a free rein--let\\nus suppose that the man feels a desire to return to the home of his\\nchildhood, that he does so, and that he meets there certain people who\\nsuspect and accuse his mother.... do you realize the sorrow and anguish\\nof such an interview in the very house wherein the original drama was\\nplayed?”\\n\\nHis words seemed to echo for a few seconds in the ensuing silence,\\nand one could read upon the faces of the Count and Countess de Dreux a\\nbewildered effort to comprehend his meaning and, at the same time, the\\nfear and anguish of such a comprehension. The count spoke at last, and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“Who are you, monsieur?”\\n\\n“I? The chevalier Floriani, whom you met at Palermo, and whom you have\\nbeen gracious enough to invite to your house on several occasions.”\\n\\n“Then what does this story mean?”\\n\\n“Oh! nothing at all! It is simply a pastime, so far as I am concerned. I\\nendeavor to depict the pleasure that Henriette’s son, if he still lives,\\nwould have in telling you that he was the guilty party, and that he did\\nit because his mother was unhappy, as she was on the point of losing\\nthe place of a.... servant, by which she lived, and because the child\\nsuffered at sight of his mother’s sorrow.”\\n\\nHe spoke with suppressed emotion, rose partially and inclined toward\\nthe countess. There could be no doubt that the chevalier Floriani was\\nHenriette’s son. His attitude and words proclaimed it. Besides, was it\\nnot his obvious intention and desire to be recognized as such?\\n\\nThe count hesitated. What action would he take against the audacious\\nguest? Ring? Provoke a scandal? Unmask the man who had once robbed him?\\nBut that was a long time ago! And who would believe that absurd story\\nabout the guilty child? No; better far to accept the situation, and\\npretend not to comprehend the true meaning of it. So the count, turning\\nto Floriani, exclaimed:\\n\\n“Your story is very curious, very entertaining; I enjoyed it much. But\\nwhat do you think has become of this young man, this model son? I\\nhope he has not abandoned the career in which he made such a brilliant\\ndébut.”\\n\\n“Oh! certainly not.”\\n\\n“After such a début! To steal the Queen’s Necklace at six years of age;\\nthe celebrated necklace that was coveted by Marie-Antoinette!”\\n\\n“And to steal it,” remarked Floriani, falling in with the count’s mood,\\n“without costing him the slightest trouble, without anyone thinking to\\nexamine the condition of the window, or to observe that the window-sill\\nwas too clean--that window-sill which he had wiped in order to efface\\nthe marks he had made in the thick dust. We must admit that it was\\nsufficient to turn the head of a boy at that age. It was all so easy. He\\nhad simply to desire the thing, and reach out his hand to get it.”\\n\\n“And he reached out his hand.”\\n\\n“Both hands,” replied the chevalier, laughing.\\n\\nHis companions received a shock. What mystery surrounded the life of\\nthe so-called Floriani? How wonderful must have been the life of that\\nadventurer, a thief at six years of age, and who, to-day, in search of\\nexcitement or, at most, to gratify a feeling of resentment, had come to\\nbrave his victim in her own house, audaciously, foolishly, and yet with\\nall the grace and delicacy of a courteous guest!\\n\\nHe arose and approached the countess to bid her adieu. She recoiled,\\nunconsciously. He smiled.\\n\\n“Oh! Madame, you are afraid of me! Did I pursue my role of\\nparlor-magician a step too far?”\\n\\nShe controlled herself, and replied, with her accustomed ease:\\n\\n“Not at all, monsieur. The legend of that dutiful son interested me very\\nmuch, and I am pleased to know that my necklace had such a brilliant\\ndestiny. But do you not think that the son of that woman, that\\nHenriette, was the victim of hereditary influence in the choice of his\\nvocation?”\\n\\nHe shuddered, feeling the point, and replied:\\n\\n“I am sure of it; and, moreover, his natural tendency to crime must have\\nbeen very strong or he would have been discouraged.”\\n\\n“Why so?”\\n\\n“Because, as you must know, the majority of the diamonds were false. The\\nonly genuine stones were the few purchased from the English jeweler, the\\nothers having been sold, one by one, to meet the cruel necessities of\\nlife.”\\n\\n“It was still the Queen’s Necklace, monsieur,” replied the countess,\\nhaughtily, “and that is something that he, Henriette’s son, could not\\nappreciate.”\\n\\n“He was able to appreciate, madame, that, whether true or false,\\nthe necklace was nothing more that an object of parade, an emblem of\\nsenseless pride.”\\n\\nThe count made a threatening gesture, but his wife stopped him.\\n\\n“Monsieur,” she said, “if the man to whom you allude has the slightest\\nsense of honor---”\\n\\nShe stopped, intimidated by Floriani’s cool manner.\\n\\n“If that man has the slightest sense of honor,” he repeated.\\n\\nShe felt that she would not gain anything by speaking to him in that\\nmanner, and in spite of her anger and indignation, trembling as she was\\nfrom humiliated pride, she said to him, almost politely:\\n\\n“Monsieur, the legend says that Rétaux de Villette, when in possession\\nof the Queen’s Necklace, did not disfigure the mounting. He understood\\nthat the diamonds were simply the ornament, the accessory, and that\\nthe mounting was the essential work, the creation of the artist, and\\nhe respected it accordingly. Do you think that this man had the same\\nfeeling?”\\n\\n“I have no doubt that the mounting still exists. The child respected\\nit.”\\n\\n“Well, monsieur, if you should happen to meet him, will you tell him\\nthat he unjustly keeps possession of a relic that is the property and\\npride of a certain family, and that, although the stones have\\nbeen removed, the Queen’s necklace still belongs to the house of\\nDreux-Soubise. It belongs to us as much as our name or our honor.”\\n\\nThe chevalier replied, simply:\\n\\n“I shall tell him, madame.”\\n\\nHe bowed to her, saluted the count and the other guests, and departed.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nFour days later, the countess de Dreux found upon the table in her\\nchamber a red leather case bearing the cardinal’s arms. She opened it,\\nand found the Queen’s Necklace.\\n\\nBut as all things must, in the life of a man who strives for unity and\\nlogic, converge toward the same goal--and as a little advertising never\\ndoes any harm--on the following day, the _Echo de France_ published\\nthese sensational lines:\\n\\n“The Queen’s Necklace, the famous historical jewelry stolen from\\nthe family of Dreux-Soubise, has been recovered by Arsène Lupin, who\\nhastened to restore it to its rightful owner. We cannot too highly\\ncommend such a delicate and chivalrous act.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. The Seven of Hearts\\n\\n\\nI am frequently asked this question: “How did you make the acquaintance\\nof Arsène Lupin?”\\n\\nMy connection with Arsène Lupin was well known. The details that I\\ngather concerning that mysterious man, the irrefutable facts that I\\npresent, the new evidence that I produce, the interpretation that I\\nplace on certain acts of which the public has seen only the exterior\\nmanifestations without being able to discover the secret reasons or\\nthe invisible mechanism, all establish, if not an intimacy, at least\\namicable relations and regular confidences.\\n\\nBut how did I make his acquaintance? Why was I selected to be his\\nhistoriographer? Why I, and not some one else?\\n\\nThe answer is simple: chance alone presided over my choice; my merit was\\nnot considered. It was chance that put me in his way. It was by chance\\nthat I was participant in one of his strangest and most mysterious\\nadventures; and by chance that I was an actor in a drama of which he was\\nthe marvelous stage director; an obscure and intricate drama, bristling\\nwith such thrilling events that I feel a certain embarrassment in\\nundertaking to describe it.\\n\\nThe first act takes place during that memorable night of 22 June, of\\nwhich so much has already been said. And, for my part, I attribute the\\nanomalous conduct of which I was guilty on that occasion to the unusual\\nframe of mind in which I found myself on my return home. I had dined\\nwith some friends at the Cascade restaurant, and, the entire evening,\\nwhilst we smoked and the orchestra played melancholy waltzes, we talked\\nonly of crimes and thefts, and dark and frightful intrigues. That is\\nalways a poor overture to a night’s sleep.\\n\\nThe Saint-Martins went away in an automobile. Jean Daspry--that\\ndelightful, heedless Daspry who, six months later, was killed in such a\\ntragic manner on the frontier of Morocco--Jean Daspry and I returned\\non foot through the dark, warm night. When we arrived in front of\\nthe little house in which I had lived for a year at Neuilly, on the\\nboulevard Maillot, he said to me:\\n\\n“Are you afraid?”\\n\\n“What an idea!”\\n\\n“But this house is so isolated.... no neighbors.... vacant lots....Really,\\nI am not a coward, and yet---”\\n\\n“Well, you are very cheering, I must say.”\\n\\n“Oh! I say that as I would say anything else. The Saint-Martins have\\nimpressed me with their stories of brigands and thieves.”\\n\\nWe shook hands and said good-night. I took out my key and opened the\\ndoor.\\n\\n“Well, that is good,” I murmured, “Antoine has forgotten to light a\\ncandle.”\\n\\nThen I recalled the fact that Antoine was away; I had given him a\\nshort leave of absence. Forthwith, I was disagreeably oppressed by the\\ndarkness and silence of the night. I ascended the stairs on tiptoe,\\nand reached my room as quickly as possible; then, contrary to my usual\\nhabit, I turned the key and pushed the bolt.\\n\\nThe light of my candle restored my courage. Yet I was careful to take my\\nrevolver from its case--a large, powerful weapon--and place it beside\\nmy bed. That precaution completed my reassurance. I laid down and, as\\nusual, took a book from my night-table to read myself to sleep. Then I\\nreceived a great surprise. Instead of the paper-knife with which I had\\nmarked my place on the preceding, I found an envelope, closed with\\nfive seals of red wax. I seized it eagerly. It was addressed to me, and\\nmarked: “Urgent.”\\n\\nA letter! A letter addressed to me! Who could have put it in that place?\\nNervously, I tore open the envelope, and read:\\n\\n“From the moment you open this letter, whatever happens, whatever you\\nmay hear, do not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise you are doomed.”\\n\\nI am not a coward, and, quite as well as another, I can face real\\ndanger, or smile at the visionary perils of imagination. But, let me\\nrepeat, I was in an anomalous condition of mind, with my nerves set on\\nedge by the events of the evening. Besides, was there not, in my present\\nsituation, something startling and mysterious, calculated to disturb the\\nmost courageous spirit?\\n\\nMy feverish fingers clutched the sheet of paper, and I read and re-read\\nthose threatening words: “Do not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise,\\nyou are doomed.”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” I thought. “It is a joke; the work of some cheerful idiot.”\\n\\nI was about to laugh--a good loud laugh. Who prevented me? What haunting\\nfear compressed my throat?\\n\\nAt least, I would blow out the candle. No, I could not do it. “Do not\\nmove, or you are doomed,” were the words he had written.\\n\\nThese auto-suggestions are frequently more imperious than the most\\npositive realities; but why should I struggle against them? I had simply\\nto close my eyes. I did so.\\n\\nAt that moment, I heard a slight noise, followed by crackling sounds,\\nproceeding from a large room used by me as a library. A small room or\\nantechamber was situated between the library and my bedchamber.\\n\\nThe approach of an actual danger greatly excited me, and I felt a desire\\nto get up, seize my revolver, and rush into the library. I did not rise;\\nI saw one of the curtains of the left window move. There was no doubt\\nabout it: the curtain had moved. It was still moving. And I saw--oh! I\\nsaw quite distinctly--in the narrow space between the curtains and the\\nwindow, a human form; a bulky mass that prevented the curtains from\\nhanging straight. And it is equally certain that the man saw me through\\nthe large meshes of the curtain. Then, I understood the situation.\\nHis mission was to guard me while the others carried away their booty.\\nShould I rise and seize my revolver? Impossible! He was there! At the\\nleast movement, at the least cry, I was doomed.\\n\\nThen came a terrific noise that shook the house; this was followed\\nby lighter sounds, two or three together, like those of a hammer that\\nrebounded. At least, that was the impression formed in my confused\\nbrain. These were mingled with other sounds, thus creating a veritable\\nuproar which proved that the intruders were not only bold, but felt\\nthemselves secure from interruption.\\n\\nThey were right. I did not move. Was it cowardice? No, rather weakness,\\na total inability to move any portion of my body, combined with\\ndiscretion; for why should I struggle? Behind that man, there were ten\\nothers who would come to his assistance. Should I risk my life to save a\\nfew tapestries and bibelots?\\n\\nThroughout the night, my torture endured. Insufferable torture, terrible\\nanguish! The noises had stopped, but I was in constant fear of their\\nrenewal. And the man! The man who was guarding me, weapon in hand. My\\nfearful eyes remained cast in his direction. And my heart beat! And a\\nprofuse perspiration oozed from every pore of my body!\\n\\nSuddenly, I experienced an immense relief; a milk-wagon, whose sound was\\nfamiliar to me, passed along the boulevard; and, at the same time, I had\\nan impression that the light of a new day was trying to steal through\\nthe closed window-blinds.\\n\\nAt last, daylight penetrated the room; other vehicles passed along the\\nboulevard; and all the phantoms of the night vanished. Then I put one\\narm out of the bed, slowly and cautiously. My eyes were fixed upon the\\ncurtain, locating the exact spot at which I must fire; I made an exact\\ncalculation of the movements I must make; then, quickly, I seized my\\nrevolver and fired.\\n\\nI leaped from my bed with a cry of deliverance, and rushed to the\\nwindow. The bullet had passed through the curtain and the window-glass,\\nbut it had not touched the man--for the very good reason that there was\\nnone there. Nobody! Thus, during the entire night, I had been\\nhypnotized by a fold of the curtain. And, during that time, the\\nmalefactors....Furiously, with an enthusiasm that nothing could have\\nstopped, I turned the key, opened the door, crossed the antechamber,\\nopened another door, and rushed into the library. But amazement stopped\\nme on the threshold, panting, astounded, more astonished than I had\\nbeen by the absence of the man. All the things that I supposed had been\\nstolen, furniture, books, pictures, old tapestries, everything was in\\nits proper place.\\n\\nIt was incredible. I could not believe my eyes. Notwithstanding that\\nuproar, those noises of removal....I made a tour, I inspected the walls,\\nI made a mental inventory of all the familiar objects. Nothing was\\nmissing. And, what was more disconcerting, there was no clue to the\\nintruders, not a sign, not a chair disturbed, not the trace of a\\nfootstep.\\n\\n“Well! Well!” I said to myself, pressing my hands on my bewildered head,\\n“surely I am not crazy! I heard something!”\\n\\nInch by inch, I made a careful examination of the room. It was in vain.\\nUnless I could consider this as a discovery: Under a small Persian rug,\\nI found a card--an ordinary playing card. It was the seven of hearts;\\nit was like any other seven of hearts in French playing-cards, with this\\nslight but curious exception: The extreme point of each of the seven red\\nspots or hearts was pierced by a hole, round and regular as if made with\\nthe point of an awl.\\n\\nNothing more. A card and a letter found in a book. But was not that\\nsufficient to affirm that I had not been the plaything of a dream?\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nThroughout the day, I continued my searches in the library. It was a\\nlarge room, much too large for the requirements of such a house, and the\\ndecoration of which attested the bizarre taste of its founder. The\\nfloor was a mosaic of multicolored stones, formed into large symmetrical\\ndesigns. The walls were covered with a similar mosaic, arranged in\\npanels, Pompeiian allegories, Byzantine compositions, frescoes of the\\nMiddle Ages. A Bacchus bestriding a cask. An emperor wearing a gold\\ncrown, a flowing beard, and holding a sword in his right hand.\\n\\nQuite high, after the style of an artist’s studio, there was a large\\nwindow--the only one in the room. That window being always open at\\nnight, it was probable that the men had entered through it, by the aid\\nof a ladder. But, again, there was no evidence. The bottom of the ladder\\nwould have left some marks in the soft earth beneath the window; but\\nthere were none. Nor were there any traces of footsteps in any part of\\nthe yard.\\n\\nI had no idea of informing the police, because the facts I had before me\\nwere so absurd and inconsistent. They would laugh at me. However, as I\\nwas then a reporter on the staff of the ‘Gil Blas,’ I wrote a lengthy\\naccount of my adventure and it was published in the paper on the second\\nday thereafter. The article attracted some attention, but no one took it\\nseriously. They regarded it as a work of fiction rather than a story\\nof real life. The Saint-Martins rallied me. But Daspry, who took an\\ninterest in such matters, came to see me, made a study of the affair,\\nbut reached no conclusion.\\n\\nA few mornings later, the door-bell rang, and Antoine came to inform\\nme that a gentleman desired to see me. He would not give his name. I\\ndirected Antoine to show him up. He was a man of about forty years of\\nage with a very dark complexion, lively features, and whose correct\\ndress, slightly frayed, proclaimed a taste that contrasted strangely\\nwith his rather vulgar manners. Without any preamble, he said to me--in\\na rough voice that confirmed my suspicion as to his social position:\\n\\n“Monsieur, whilst in a café, I picked up a copy of the ‘Gil Blas,’ and\\nread your article. It interested me very much.\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\n“And here I am.”\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\n“Yes, to talk to you. Are all the facts related by you quite correct?”\\n\\n“Absolutely so.”\\n\\n“Well, in that case, I can, perhaps, give you some information.”\\n\\n“Very well; proceed.”\\n\\n“No, not yet. First, I must be sure that the facts are exactly as you\\nhave related them.”\\n\\n“I have given you my word. What further proof do you want?”\\n\\n“I must remain alone in this room.”\\n\\n“I do not understand,” I said, with surprise.\\n\\n“It’s an idea that occurred to me when reading your article. Certain\\ndetails established an extraordinary coincidence with another case that\\ncame under my notice. If I am mistaken, I shall say nothing more. And\\nthe only means of ascertaining the truth is by my remaining in the room\\nalone.”\\n\\nWhat was at the bottom of this proposition? Later, I recalled that the\\nman was exceedingly nervous; but, at the same time, although somewhat\\nastonished, I found nothing particularly abnormal about the man or the\\nrequest he had made. Moreover, my curiosity was aroused; so I replied:\\n\\n“Very well. How much time do you require?”\\n\\n“Oh! three minutes--not longer. Three minutes from now, I will rejoin\\nyou.”\\n\\nI left the room, and went downstairs. I took out my watch. One minute\\npassed. Two minutes. Why did I feel so depressed? Why did those moments\\nseem so solemn and weird? Two minutes and a half....Two minutes and\\nthree quarters. Then I heard a pistol shot.\\n\\nI bounded up the stairs and entered the room. A cry of horror escaped\\nme. In the middle of the room, the man was lying on his left side,\\nmotionless. Blood was flowing from a wound in his forehead. Near his\\nhand was a revolver, still smoking.\\n\\nBut, in addition to this frightful spectacle, my attention was attracted\\nby another object. At two feet from the body, upon the floor, I saw\\na playing-card. It was the seven of hearts. I picked it up. The lower\\nextremity of each of the seven spots was pierced with a small round\\nhole.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nA half-hour later, the commissary of police arrived, then the coroner\\nand the chief of the Sûreté, Mon. Dudouis. I had been careful not to\\ntouch the corpse. The preliminary inquiry was very brief, and disclosed\\nnothing. There were no papers in the pockets of the deceased; no name\\nupon his clothes; no initial upon his linen; nothing to give any clue\\nto his identity. The room was in the same perfect order as before. The\\nfurniture had not been disturbed. Yet this man had not come to my house\\nsolely for the purpose of killing himself, or because he considered my\\nplace the most convenient one for his suicide! There must have been a\\nmotive for his act of despair, and that motive was, no doubt, the result\\nof some new fact ascertained by him during the three minutes he was\\nalone.\\n\\nWhat was that fact? What had he seen? What frightful secret had been\\nrevealed to him? There was no answer to these questions. But, at the\\nlast moment, an incident occurred that appeared to us of considerable\\nimportance. As two policemen were raising the body to place it on a\\nstretcher, the left hand thus being disturbed, a crumpled card fell from\\nit. The card bore these words: “Georges Andermatt, 37 Rue de Berry.”\\n\\nWhat did that mean? Georges Andermatt was a rich banker in Paris, the\\nfounder and president of the Metal Exchange which had given such an\\nimpulse to the metallic industries in France. He lived in princely\\nstyle; was the possessor of numerous automobiles, coaches, and an\\nexpensive racing-stable. His social affairs were very select, and Madame\\nAndermatt was noted for her grace and beauty.\\n\\n“Can that be the man’s name?” I asked.---------------\\n\\nThe chief of the Sûreté leaned over him.\\n\\n“It is not he. Mon. Andermatt is a thin man, and slightly grey.”\\n\\n“But why this card?”\\n\\n“Have you a telephone, monsieur?”\\n\\n“Yes, in the vestibule. Come with me.”\\n\\nHe looked in the directory, and then asked for number 415.21.\\n\\n“Is Mon. Andermatt at home?....Please tell him that Mon. Dudouis wished\\nhim to come at once to 102 Boulevard Maillot. Very important.”\\n\\nTwenty minutes later, Mon. Andermatt arrived in his automobile. After\\nthe circumstances had been explained to him, he was taken in to see the\\ncorpse. He displayed considerable emotion, and spoke, in a low tone, and\\napparently unwillingly:\\n\\n“Etienne Varin,” he said.\\n\\n“You know him?”\\n\\n“No.... or, at least, yes.... by sight only. His brother....”\\n\\n“Ah! he has a brother?”\\n\\n“Yes, Alfred Varin. He came to see me once on some matter of\\nbusiness....I forget what it was.”\\n\\n“Where does he live?”\\n\\n“The two brothers live together--rue de Provence, I think.”\\n\\n“Do you know any reason why he should commit suicide?”\\n\\n“None.”\\n\\n“He held a card in his hand. It was your card with your address.”\\n\\n“I do not understand that. It must have been there by some chance that\\nwill be disclosed by the investigation.”\\n\\nA very strange chance, I thought; and I felt that the others entertained\\nthe same impression.\\n\\nI discovered the same impression in the papers next day, and amongst\\nall my friends with whom I discussed the affair. Amid the mysteries that\\nenveloped it, after the double discovery of the seven of hearts pierced\\nwith seven holes, after the two inscrutable events that had happened in\\nmy house, that visiting card promised to throw some light on the\\naffair. Through it, the truth may be revealed. But, contrary to our\\nexpectations, Mon. Andermatt furnished no explanation. He said:\\n\\n“I have told you all I know. What more can I do? I am greatly surprised\\nthat my card should be found in such a place, and I sincerely hope the\\npoint will be cleared up.”\\n\\nIt was not. The official investigation established that the Varin\\nbrothers were of Swiss origin, had led a shifting life under various\\nnames, frequenting gambling resorts, associating with a band of\\nforeigners who had been dispersed by the police after a series of\\nrobberies in which their participation was established only by their\\nflight. At number 24 rue de Provence, where the Varin brothers had lived\\nsix years before, no one knew what had become of them.\\n\\nI confess that, for my part, the case seemed to me so complicated and so\\nmysterious that I did not think the problem would ever be solved, so\\nI concluded to waste no more time upon it. But Jean Daspry, whom I\\nfrequently met at that period, became more and more interested in it\\neach day. It was he who pointed out to me that item from a foreign\\nnewspaper which was reproduced and commented upon by the entire press.\\nIt was as follows:\\n\\n“The first trial of a new model of submarine boat, which is expected\\nto revolutionize naval warfare, will be given in presence of the former\\nEmperor at a place that will be kept secret until the last minute. An\\nindiscretion has revealed its name; it is called ‘The Seven-of-Hearts.’”\\n\\nThe Seven-of-Hearts! That presented a new problem. Could a connection be\\nestablished between the name of the sub-marine and the incidents which\\nwe have related? But a connection of what nature? What had happened here\\ncould have no possible relation with the sub-marine.\\n\\n“What do you know about it?” said Daspry to me. “The most diverse\\neffects often proceed from the same cause.”\\n\\nTwo days later, the following foreign news item was received and\\npublished:\\n\\n“It is said that the plans of the new sub-marine ‘Seven-of-Hearts’ were\\nprepared by French engineers, who, having sought, in vain, the support\\nof their compatriots, subsequently entered into negotiations with the\\nBritish Admiralty, without success.”\\n\\nI do not wish to give undue publicity to certain delicate matters which\\nonce provoked considerable excitement. Yet, since all danger of injury\\ntherefrom has now come to an end, I must speak of the article that\\nappeared in the _Echo de France_, which aroused so much comment at\\nthat time, and which threw considerable light upon the mystery of\\nthe Seven-of-Hearts. This is the article as it was published over the\\nsignature of Salvator:\\n\\n  “THE AFFAIR OF THE SEVEN-OF-HEARTS.\\n\\n  “A CORNER OF THE VEIL RAISED.\\n\\n “We will be brief. Ten years ago, a young mining engineer, Louis\\n  Lacombe, wishing to devote his time and fortune to certain studies,\\n  resigned his position he then held, and rented number 102 boulevard\\n  Maillot, a small house that had been recently built and decorated\\n  for an Italian count. Through the agency of the Varin brothers of\\n  Lausanne, one of whom assisted in the preliminary experiments and\\n  the other acted as financial agent, the young engineer was\\n  introduced to Georges Andermatt, the founder of the Metal Exchange.\\n\\n  “After several interviews, he succeeded in interesting the banker\\n  in a sub-marine boat on which he was working, and it was agreed\\n  that as soon as the invention was perfected, Mon. Andermatt would\\n  use his influence with the Minister of Marine to obtain a series of\\n  trials under the direction of the government. For two years, Louis\\n  Lacombe was a frequent visitor at Andermatt’s house, and he\\n  submitted to the banker the various improvements he made upon his\\n  original plans, until one day, being satisfied with the perfection\\n  of his work, he asked Mon. Andermatt to communicate with the\\n  Minister of Marine. That day, Louis Lacombe dined at Mon.\\n  Andermatt’s house. He left there about half-past eleven at night.\\n  He has not been seen since.\\n\\n  “A perusal of the newspapers of that date will show that the\\n  young man’s family caused every possible inquiry to be made, but\\n  without success; and it was the general opinion that Louis Lacombe--\\n  who was known as an original and visionary youth--had quietly left\\n  for parts unknown.\\n\\n  “Let us accept that theory--improbable, though it be,--and let us\\n  consider another question, which is a most important one for our\\n  country: What has become of the plans of the sub-marine? Did Louis\\n  Lacombe carry them away? Are they destroyed?\\n\\n  “After making a thorough investigation, we are able to assert,\\n  positively, that the plans are in existence, and are now in the\\n  possession of the two brothers Varin. How did they acquire such a\\n  possession? That is a question not yet determined; nor do we know\\n  why they have not tried to sell them at an earlier date. Did they\\n  fear that their title to them would be called in question? If so,\\n  they have lost that fear, and we can announce definitely, that the\\n  plans of Louis Lacombe are now the property of foreign power, and\\n  we are in a position to publish the correspondence that passed\\n  between the Varin brothers and the representative of that power.\\n  The ‘Seven-of-Hearts’ invented by Louis Lacombe has been actually\\n  constructed by our neighbor.\\n\\n  “Will the invention fulfill the optimistic expectations of those\\n  who were concerned in that treacherous act?”\\n\\nAnd a post-script adds:\\n\\n  “Later.--Our special correspondent informs us that the preliminary\\n  trial of the ‘Seven-of-Hearts’ has not been satisfactory. It is\\n  quite likely that the plans sold and delivered by the Varin\\n  brothers did not include the final document carried by Louis\\n  Lacombe to Mon. Andermatt on the day of his disappearance, a\\n  document that was indispensable to a thorough understanding of the\\n  invention. It contained a summary of the final conclusions of the\\n  inventor, and estimates and figures not contained in the other\\n  papers. Without this document, the plans are incomplete; on the\\n  other hand, without the plans, the document is worthless.\\n\\n  “Now is the time to act and recover what belongs to us. It may\\n  be a difficult matter, but we rely upon the assistance of Mon.\\n  Andermatt. It will be to his interest to explain his conduct which\\n  has hitherto been so strange and inscrutable. He will explain not\\n  only why he concealed these facts at the time of the suicide of\\n  Etienne Varin, but also why he has never revealed the disappearance\\n  of the paper--a fact well known to him. He will tell why, during\\n  the last six years, he paid spies to watch the movements of the\\n  Varin brothers. We expect from him, not only words, but acts. And\\n  at once. Otherwise---”\\n\\nThe threat was plainly expressed. But of what did it consist? What whip\\nwas Salvator, the anonymous writer of the article, holding over the head\\nof Mon. Andermatt?\\n\\nAn army of reporters attacked the banker, and ten interviewers announced\\nthe scornful manner in which they were treated. Thereupon, the _Echo de\\nFrance_ announced its position in these words:\\n\\n“Whether Mon. Andermatt is willing or not, he will be, henceforth, our\\ncollaborator in the work we have undertaken.”\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nDaspry and I were dining together on the day on which that announcement\\nappeared. That evening, with the newspapers spread over my table, we\\ndiscussed the affair and examined it from every point of view with that\\nexasperation that a person feels when walking in the dark and finding\\nhimself constantly falling over the same obstacles. Suddenly, without\\nany warning whatsoever, the door opened and a lady entered. Her face was\\nhidden behind a thick veil. I rose at once and approached her.\\n\\n“Is it you, monsieur, who lives here?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes, madame, but I do not understand---”\\n\\n“The gate was not locked,” she explained.\\n\\n“But the vestibule door?”\\n\\nShe did not reply, and it occurred to me that she had used the servants’\\nentrance. How did she know the way? Then there was a silence that was\\nquite embarrassing. She looked at Daspry, and I was obliged to introduce\\nhim. I asked her to be seated and explain the object of her visit. She\\nraised her veil, and I saw that she was a brunette with regular features\\nand, though not handsome, she was attractive--principally, on account of\\nher sad, dark eyes.\\n\\n“I am Madame Andermatt,” she said.\\n\\n“Madame Andermatt!” I repeated, with astonishment.\\n\\nAfter a brief pause, she continued with a voice and manner that were\\nquite easy and natural:\\n\\n“I have come to see you about that affair--you know. I thought I might\\nbe able to obtain some information---”\\n\\n“Mon Dieu, madame, I know nothing but what has already appeared in the\\npapers. But if you will point out in what way I can help you....”\\n\\n“I do not know....I do not know.”\\n\\nNot until then did I suspect that her calm demeanor was assumed, and\\nthat some poignant grief was concealed beneath that air of tranquility.\\nFor a moment, we were silent and embarrassed. Then Daspry stepped\\nforward, and said:\\n\\n“Will you permit me to ask you a few questions?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” she cried. “I will answer.”\\n\\n“You will answer.... whatever those questions may be?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Did you know Louis Lacombe?” he asked.\\n\\n“Yes, through my husband.”\\n\\n“When did you see him for the last time?”\\n\\n“The evening he dined with us.”\\n\\n“At that time, was there anything to lead you to believe that you would\\nnever see him again?”\\n\\n“No. But he had spoken of a trip to Russia--in a vague way.”\\n\\n“Then you expected to see him again?”\\n\\n“Yes. He was to dine with us, two days later.”\\n\\n“How do you explain his disappearance?”\\n\\n“I cannot explain it.”\\n\\n“And Mon. Andermatt?”\\n\\n“I do not know.”\\n\\n“Yet the article published in the _Echo de France_ indicates---”\\n\\n“Yes, that the Varin brothers had something to do with his\\ndisappearance.”\\n\\n“Is that your opinion?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“On what do you base your opinion?”\\n\\n“When he left our house, Louis Lacombe carried a satchel containing all\\nthe papers relating to his invention. Two days later, my husband, in\\na conversation with one of the Varin brothers, learned that the papers\\nwere in their possession.”\\n\\n“And he did not denounce them?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Because there was something else in the satchel--something besides the\\npapers of Louis Lacombe.”\\n\\n“What was it?”\\n\\nShe hesitated; was on the point of speaking, but, finally, remained\\nsilent. Daspry continued:\\n\\n“I presume that is why your husband has kept a close watch over their\\nmovements instead of informing the police. He hoped to recover the\\npapers and, at the same time, that compromising article which has\\nenabled the two brothers to hold over him threats of exposure and\\nblackmail.”\\n\\n“Over him, and over me.”\\n\\n“Ah! over you, also?”\\n\\n“Over me, in particular.”\\n\\nShe uttered the last words in a hollow voice. Daspry observed it; he\\npaced to and fro for a moment, then, turning to her, asked:\\n\\n“Had you written to Louis Lacombe?”\\n\\n“Of course. My husband had business with him--”\\n\\n“Apart from those business letters, had you written to Louis\\nLacombe.... other letters? Excuse my insistence, but it is absolutely\\nnecessary that I should know the truth. Did you write other letters?”\\n\\n“Yes,” she replied, blushing.\\n\\n“And those letters came into the possession of the Varin brothers?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Does Mon. Andermatt know it?”\\n\\n“He has not seen them, but Alfred Varin has told him of their existence\\nand threatened to publish them if my husband should take any steps\\nagainst him. My husband was afraid.... of a scandal.”\\n\\n“But he has tried to recover the letters?”\\n\\n“I think so; but I do not know. You see, after that last interview with\\nAlfred Varin, and after some harsh words between me and my husband in\\nwhich he called me to account--we live as strangers.”\\n\\n“In that case, as you have nothing to lose, what do you fear?”\\n\\n“I may be indifferent to him now, but I am the woman that he has loved,\\nthe one he would still love--oh! I am quite sure of that,” she murmured,\\nin a fervent voice, “he would still love me if he had not got hold of\\nthose cursed letters----”\\n\\n“What! Did he succeed?....But the two brothers still defied him?”\\n\\n“Yes, and they boasted of having a secure hiding-place.”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“I believe my husband discovered that hiding-place.”\\n\\n“Ah! where was it?”\\n\\n“Here.”\\n\\n“Here!” I cried in alarm.\\n\\n“Yes. I always had that suspicion. Louis Lacombe was very ingenious\\nand amused himself in his leisure hours, by making safes and locks. No\\ndoubt, the Varin brothers were aware of that fact and utilized one of\\nLacombe’s safes in which to conceal the letters.... and other things,\\nperhaps.”\\n\\n“But they did not live here,” I said.\\n\\n“Before you came, four months ago, the house had been vacant for some\\ntime. And they may have thought that your presence here would not\\ninterfere with them when they wanted to get the papers. But they did not\\ncount on my husband, who came here on the night of 22 June, forced the\\nsafe, took what he was seeking, and left his card to inform the two\\nbrothers that he feared them no more, and that their positions were now\\nreversed. Two days later, after reading the article in the ‘Gil Blas,’\\nEtienne Varin came here, remained alone in this room, found the safe\\nempty, and.... killed himself.”\\n\\nAfter a moment, Daspry said:\\n\\n“A very simple theory....Has Mon. Andermatt spoken to you since then?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Has his attitude toward you changed in any way? Does he appear more\\ngloomy, more anxious?”\\n\\n“No, I haven’t noticed any change.”\\n\\n“And yet you think he has secured the letters. Now, in my opinion, he\\nhas not got those letters, and it was not he who came here on the night\\nof 22 June.”\\n\\n“Who was it, then?”\\n\\n“The mysterious individual who is managing this affair, who holds all\\nthe threads in his hands, and whose invisible but far-reaching power we\\nhave felt from the beginning. It was he and his friends who entered\\nthis house on 22 June; it was he who discovered the hiding-place of the\\npapers; it was he who left Mon. Andermatt’s card; it is he who now\\nholds the correspondence and the evidence of the treachery of the Varin\\nbrothers.”\\n\\n“Who is he?” I asked, impatiently.\\n\\n“The man who writes letters to the _Echo de France_.... Salvator! Have\\nwe not convincing evidence of that fact? Does he not mention in his\\nletters certain details that no one could know, except the man who had\\nthus discovered the secrets of the two brothers?”\\n\\n“Well, then,” stammered Madame Andermatt, in great alarm, “he has my\\nletters also, and it is he who now threatens my husband. Mon Dieu! What\\nam I to do?”\\n\\n“Write to him,” declared Daspry. “Confide in him without reserve. Tell\\nhim all you know and all you may hereafter learn. Your interest and his\\ninterest are the same. He is not working against Mon. Andermatt, but\\nagainst Alfred Varin. Help him.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“Has your husband the document that completes the plans of Louis\\nLacombe?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Tell that to Salvator, and, if possible, procure the document for him.\\nWrite to him at once. You risk nothing.”\\n\\nThe advice was bold, dangerous even at first sight, but Madame Andermatt\\nhad no choice. Besides, as Daspry had said, she ran no risk. If\\nthe unknown writer were an enemy, that step would not aggravate the\\nsituation. If he were a stranger seeking to accomplish a particular\\npurpose, he would attach to those letters only a secondary importance.\\nWhatever might happen, it was the only solution offered to her, and\\nshe, in her anxiety, was only too glad to act on it. She thanked us\\neffusively, and promised to keep us informed.\\n\\nIn fact, two days later, she sent us the following letter that she had\\nreceived from Salvator:\\n\\n“Have not found the letters, but I will get them. Rest easy. I am\\nwatching everything. S.”\\n\\nI looked at the letter. It was in the same handwriting as the note I\\nfound in my book on the night of 22 June.\\n\\nDaspry was right. Salvator was, indeed, the originator of that affair.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nWe were beginning to see a little light coming out of the darkness that\\nsurrounded us, and an unexpected light was thrown on certain points; but\\nother points yet remained obscure--for instance, the finding of the two\\nseven-of-hearts. Perhaps I was unnecessarily concerned about those\\ntwo cards whose seven punctured spots had appeared to me under such\\nstartling circumstances! Yet I could not refrain from asking myself:\\nWhat role will they play in the drama? What importance do they\\nbear? What conclusion must be drawn from the fact that the submarine\\nconstructed from the plans of Louis Lacombe bore the name of\\n‘Seven-of-Hearts’?\\n\\nDaspry gave little thought to the other two cards; he devoted all his\\nattention to another problem which he considered more urgent; he was\\nseeking the famous hiding-place.\\n\\n“And who knows,” said he, “I may find the letters that Salvator did not\\nfind--by inadvertence, perhaps. It is improbable that the Varin brothers\\nwould have removed from a spot, which they deemed inaccessible, the\\nweapon which was so valuable to them.”\\n\\nAnd he continued to search. In a short time, the large room held no more\\nsecrets for him, so he extended his investigations to the other rooms.\\nHe examined the interior and the exterior, the stones of the foundation,\\nthe bricks in the walls; he raised the slates of the roof.\\n\\nOne day, he came with a pickaxe and a spade, gave me the spade, kept the\\npickaxe, pointed to the adjacent vacant lots, and said: “Come.”\\n\\nI followed him, but I lacked his enthusiasm. He divided the vacant land\\ninto several sections which he examined in turn. At last, in a corner,\\nat the angle formed by the walls of two neighboring proprietors, a small\\npile of earth and gravel, covered with briers and grass, attracted his\\nattention. He attacked it. I was obliged to help him. For an hour, under\\na hot sun, we labored without success. I was discouraged, but Daspry\\nurged me on. His ardor was as strong as ever.\\n\\nAt last, Daspry’s pickaxe unearthed some bones--the remains of a\\nskeleton to which some scraps of clothing still hung. Suddenly, I turned\\npale. I had discovered, sticking in the earth, a small piece of iron cut\\nin the form of a rectangle, on which I thought I could see red spots. I\\nstooped and picked it up. That little iron plate was the exact size of a\\nplaying-card, and the red spots, made with red lead, were arranged upon\\nit in a manner similar to the seven-of-hearts, and each spot was pierced\\nwith a round hole similar to the perforations in the two playing cards.\\n\\n“Listen, Daspry, I have had enough of this. You can stay if it interests\\nyou. But I am going.”\\n\\nWas that simply the expression of my excited nerves? Or was it the\\nresult of a laborious task executed under a burning sun? I know that\\nI trembled as I walked away, and that I went to bed, where I remained\\nforty-eight hours, restless and feverish, haunted by skeletons that\\ndanced around me and threw their bleeding hearts at my head.\\n\\nDaspry was faithful to me. He came to my house every day, and remained\\nthree or four hours, which he spent in the large room, ferreting,\\nthumping, tapping.\\n\\n“The letters are here, in this room,” he said, from time to time, “they\\nare here. I will stake my life on it.”\\n\\nOn the morning of the third day I arose--feeble yet, but cured. A\\nsubstantial breakfast cheered me up. But a letter that I received that\\nafternoon contributed, more than anything else, to my complete recovery,\\nand aroused in me a lively curiosity. This was the letter:\\n\\n  “Monsieur,\\n\\n  “The drama, the first act of which transpired on the night of 22\\n  June, is now drawing to a close. Force of circumstances compel me\\n  to bring the two principal actors in that drama face to face, and I\\n  wish that meeting to take place in your house, if you will be so\\n  kind as to give me the use of it for this evening from nine o’clock\\n  to eleven. It will be advisable to give your servant leave of\\n  absence for the evening, and, perhaps, you will be so kind as to\\n  leave the field open to the two adversaries. You will remember\\n  that when I visited your house on the night of 22 June, I took\\n  excellent care of your property. I feel that I would do you an\\n  injustice if I should doubt, for one moment, your absolute\\n  discretion in this affair. Your devoted,\\n\\n                                 “SALVATOR.”\\n\\nI was amused at the facetious tone of his letter and also at the\\nwhimsical nature of his request. There was a charming display of\\nconfidence and candor in his language, and nothing in the world could\\nhave induced me to deceive him or repay his confidence with ingratitude.\\n\\nI gave my servant a theatre ticket, and he left the house at eight\\no’clock. A few minutes later, Daspry arrived. I showed him the letter.\\n\\n“Well?” said he.\\n\\n“Well, I have left the garden gate unlocked, so anyone can enter.”\\n\\n“And you--are you going away?”\\n\\n“Not at all. I intend to stay right here.”\\n\\n“But he asks you to go---”\\n\\n“But I am not going. I will be discreet, but I am resolved to see what\\ntakes place.”\\n\\n“Ma foi!” exclaimed Daspry, laughing, “you are right, and I shall stay\\nwith you. I shouldn’t like to miss it.”\\n\\nWe were interrupted by the sound of the door-bell.\\n\\n“Here already?” said Daspry, “twenty minutes ahead of time! Incredible!”\\n\\nI went to the door and ushered in the visitor. It was Madame Andermatt.\\nShe was faint and nervous, and in a stammering voice, she ejaculated:\\n\\n“My husband.... is coming.... he has an appointment.... they intend to\\ngive him the letters....”\\n\\n“How do you know?” I asked.\\n\\n“By chance. A message came for my husband while we were at dinner. The\\nservant gave it to me by mistake. My husband grabbed it quickly, but he\\nwas too late. I had read it.”\\n\\n“You read it?”\\n\\n“Yes. It was something like this: ‘At nine o’clock this evening, be\\nat Boulevard Maillot with the papers connected with the affair. In\\nexchange, the letters.’ So, after dinner, I hastened here.”\\n\\n“Unknown to your husband?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“What do you think about it?” asked Daspry, turning to me.\\n\\n“I think as you do, that Mon. Andermatt is one of the invited guests.”\\n\\n“Yes, but for what purpose?”\\n\\n“That is what we are going to find out.”\\n\\nI led them to a large room. The three of us could hide comfortably\\nbehind the velvet chimney-mantle, and observe all that should happen\\nin the room. We seated ourselves there, with Madame Andermatt in the\\ncentre.\\n\\nThe clock struck nine. A few minutes later, the garden gate creaked upon\\nits hinges. I confess that I was greatly agitated. I was about to learn\\nthe key to the mystery. The startling events of the last few weeks were\\nabout to be explained, and, under my eyes, the last battle was going to\\nbe fought. Daspry seized the hand of Madame Andermatt, and said to her:\\n\\n“Not a word, not a movement! Whatever you may see or hear, keep quiet!”\\n\\nSome one entered. It was Alfred Varin. I recognized him at once, owing\\nto the close resemblance he bore to his brother Etienne. There was\\nthe same slouching gait; the same cadaverous face covered with a black\\nbeard.\\n\\nHe entered with the nervous air of a man who is accustomed to fear the\\npresence of traps and ambushes; who scents and avoids them. He glanced\\nabout the room, and I had the impression that the chimney, masked with\\na velvet portière, did not please him. He took three steps in our\\ndirection, when something caused him to turn and walk toward the old\\nmosaic king, with the flowing beard and flamboyant sword, which he\\nexamined minutely, mounting on a chair and following with his fingers\\nthe outlines of the shoulders and head and feeling certain parts of the\\nface. Suddenly, he leaped from the chair and walked away from it. He had\\nheard the sound of approaching footsteps. Mon. Andermatt appeared at the\\ndoor.\\n\\n“You! You!” exclaimed the banker. “Was it you who brought me here?”\\n\\n“I? By no means,” protested Varin, in a rough, jerky voice that reminded\\nme of his brother, “on the contrary, it was your letter that brought me\\nhere.”\\n\\n“My letter?”\\n\\n“A letter signed by you, in which you offered---”\\n\\n“I never wrote to you,” declared Mon. Andermatt.\\n\\n“You did not write to me!”\\n\\nInstinctively, Varin was put on his guard, not against the banker, but\\nagainst the unknown enemy who had drawn him into this trap. A second\\ntime, he looked in our direction, then walked toward the door. But Mon.\\nAndermatt barred his passage.\\n\\n“Well, where are you going, Varin?”\\n\\n“There is something about this affair I don’t like. I am going home.\\nGood evening.”\\n\\n“One moment!”\\n\\n“No need of that, Mon. Andermatt. I have nothing to say to you.”\\n\\n“But I have something to say to you, and this is a good time to say it.”\\n\\n“Let me pass.”\\n\\n“No, you will not pass.”\\n\\nVarin recoiled before the resolute attitude of the banker, as he\\nmuttered:\\n\\n“Well, then, be quick about it.”\\n\\nOne thing astonished me; and I have no doubt my two companions\\nexperienced a similar feeling. Why was Salvator not there? Was he not a\\nnecessary party at this conference? Or was he satisfied to let these two\\nadversaries fight it out between themselves? At all events, his absence\\nwas a great disappointment, although it did not detract from the\\ndramatic strength of the situation.\\n\\nAfter a moment, Mon. Andermatt approached Varin and, face to face, eye\\nto eye, said:\\n\\n“Now, after all these years and when you have nothing more to fear, you\\ncan answer me candidly: What have you done with Louis Lacombe?”\\n\\n“What a question! As if I knew anything about him!”\\n\\n“You do know! You and your brother were his constant companions, almost\\nlived with him in this very house. You knew all about his plans and his\\nwork. And the last night I ever saw Louis Lacombe, when I parted with\\nhim at my door, I saw two men slinking away in the shadows of the trees.\\nThat, I am ready to swear to.”\\n\\n“Well, what has that to do with me?”\\n\\n“The two men were you and your brother.”\\n\\n“Prove it.”\\n\\n“The best proof is that, two days later, you yourself showed me the\\npapers and the plans that belonged to Lacombe and offered to sell them.\\nHow did these papers come into your possession?”\\n\\n“I have already told you, Mon. Andermatt, that we found them on Louis\\nLacombe’s table, the morning after his disappearance.”\\n\\n“That is a lie!”\\n\\n“Prove it.”\\n\\n“The law will prove it.”\\n\\n“Why did you not appeal to the law?”\\n\\n“Why? Ah! Why---,” stammered the banker, with a slight display of\\nemotion.\\n\\n“You know very well, Mon. Andermatt, if you had the least certainty of\\nour guilt, our little threat would not have stopped you.”\\n\\n“What threat? Those letters? Do you suppose I ever gave those letters a\\nmoment’s thought?”\\n\\n“If you did not care for the letters, why did you offer me thousands of\\nfrancs for their return? And why did you have my brother and me tracked\\nlike wild beasts?”\\n\\n“To recover the plans.”\\n\\n“Nonsense! You wanted the letters. You knew that as soon as you had the\\nletters in your possession, you could denounce us. Oh! no, I couldn’t\\npart with them!”\\n\\nHe laughed heartily, but stopped suddenly, and said:\\n\\n“But, enough of this! We are merely going over old ground. We make no\\nheadway. We had better let things stand as they are.”\\n\\n“We will not let them stand as they are,” said the banker, “and since\\nyou have referred to the letters, let me tell you that you will not\\nleave this house until you deliver up those letters.”\\n\\n“I shall go when I please.”\\n\\n“You will not.”\\n\\n“Be careful, Mon. Andermatt. I warn you---”\\n\\n“I say, you shall not go.”\\n\\n“We will see about that,” cried Varin, in such a rage that Madame\\nAndermatt could not suppress a cry of fear. Varin must have heard it,\\nfor he now tried to force his way out. Mon. Andermatt pushed him back.\\nThen I saw him put his hand into his coat pocket.\\n\\n“For the last time, let me pass,” he cried.\\n\\n“The letters, first!”\\n\\nVarin drew a revolver and, pointing it at Mon. Andermatt, said:\\n\\n“Yes or no?”\\n\\nThe banker stooped quickly. There was the sound of a pistol-shot. The\\nweapon fell from Varin’s hand. I was amazed. The shot was fired close\\nto me. It was Daspry who had fired it at Varin, causing him to drop the\\nrevolver. In a moment, Daspry was standing between the two men, facing\\nVarin; he said to him, with a sneer:\\n\\n“You were lucky, my friend, very lucky. I fired at your hand and struck\\nonly the revolver.”\\n\\nBoth of them looked at him, surprised. Then he turned to the banker, and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, monsieur, for meddling in your business; but,\\nreally, you play a very poor game. Let me hold the cards.”\\n\\nTurning again to Varin, Daspry said:\\n\\n“It’s between us two, comrade, and play fair, if you please. Hearts are\\ntrumps, and I play the seven.”\\n\\nThen Daspry held up, before Varin’s bewildered eyes, the little iron\\nplate, marked with the seven red spots. It was a terrible shock to\\nVarin. With livid features, staring eyes, and an air of intense agony,\\nthe man seemed to be hypnotized at the sight of it.\\n\\n“Who are you?” he gasped.\\n\\n“One who meddles in other people’s business, down to the very bottom.”\\n\\n“What do you want?”\\n\\n“What you brought here tonight.”\\n\\n“I brought nothing.”\\n\\n“Yes, you did, or you wouldn’t have come. This morning, you received\\nan invitation to come here at nine o’clock, and bring with you all the\\npapers held by you. You are here. Where are the papers?”\\n\\nThere was in Daspry’s voice and manner a tone of authority that I did\\nnot understand; his manner was usually quite mild and conciliatory.\\nAbsolutely conquered, Varin placed his hand on one of his pockets, and\\nsaid:\\n\\n“The papers are here.”\\n\\n“All of them?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“All that you took from Louis Lacombe and afterwards sold to Major von\\nLieben?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Are these the copies or the originals?”\\n\\n“I have the originals.”\\n\\n“How much do you want for them?”\\n\\n“One hundred thousand francs.”\\n\\n“You are crazy,” said Daspry. “Why, the major gave you only twenty\\nthousand, and that was like money thrown into the sea, as the boat was a\\nfailure at the preliminary trials.”\\n\\n“They didn’t understand the plans.”\\n\\n“The plans are not complete.”\\n\\n“Then, why do you ask me for them?”\\n\\n“Because I want them. I offer you five thousand francs--not a sou more.”\\n\\n“Ten thousand. Not a sou less.”\\n\\n“Agreed,” said Daspry, who now turned to Mon. Andermatt, and said:\\n\\n“Monsieur will kindly sign a check for the amount.”\\n\\n“But....I haven’t got---”\\n\\n“Your check-book? Here it is.”\\n\\nAstounded, Mon. Andermatt examined the check-book that Daspry handed to\\nhim.\\n\\n“It is mine,” he gasped. “How does that happen?”\\n\\n“No idle words, monsieur, if you please. You have merely to sign.”\\n\\nThe banker took out his fountain pen, filled out the check and signed\\nit. Varin held out his hand for it.\\n\\n“Put down your hand,” said Daspry, “there is something more.” Then, to\\nthe banker, he said: “You asked for some letters, did you not?”\\n\\n“Yes, a package of letters.”\\n\\n“Where are they, Varin?”\\n\\n“I haven’t got them.”\\n\\n“Where are they, Varin?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. My brother had charge of them.”\\n\\n“They are hidden in this room.”\\n\\n“In that case, you know where they are.”\\n\\n“How should I know?”\\n\\n“Was it not you who found the hiding-place? You appear to be as well\\ninformed.... as Salvator.”\\n\\n“The letters are not in the hiding-place.”\\n\\n“They are.”\\n\\n“Open it.”\\n\\nVarin looked at him, defiantly. Were not Daspry and Salvator the same\\nperson? Everything pointed to that conclusion. If so, Varin risked\\nnothing in disclosing a hiding-place already known.\\n\\n“Open it,” repeated Daspry.\\n\\n“I have not got the seven of hearts.”\\n\\n“Yes, here it is,” said Daspry, handing him the iron plate. Varin\\nrecoiled in terror, and cried:\\n\\n“No, no, I will not.”\\n\\n“Never mind,” replied Daspry, as he walked toward the bearded king,\\nclimbed on a chair and applied the seven of hearts to the lower part of\\nthe sword in such a manner that the edges of the iron plate coincided\\nexactly with the two edges of the sword. Then, with the assistance of\\nan awl which he introduced alternately into each of the seven holes, he\\npressed upon seven of the little mosaic stones. As he pressed upon the\\nseventh one, a clicking sound was heard, and the entire bust of the King\\nturned upon a pivot, disclosing a large opening lined with steel. It was\\nreally a fire-proof safe.\\n\\n“You can see, Varin, the safe is empty.”\\n\\n“So I see. Then, my brother has taken out the letters.”\\n\\nDaspry stepped down from the chair, approached Varin, and said:\\n\\n“Now, no more nonsense with me. There is another hiding-place. Where is\\nit?”\\n\\n“There is none.”\\n\\n“Is it money you want? How much?”\\n\\n“Ten thousand.”\\n\\n“Monsieur Andermatt, are those letters worth ten thousand francs to\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the banker, firmly.\\n\\nVarin closed the safe, took the seven of hearts and placed it again on\\nthe sword at the same spot. He thrust the awl into each of the seven\\nholes. There was the same clicking sound, but this time, strange to\\nrelate, it was only a portion of the safe that revolved on the pivot,\\ndisclosing quite a small safe that was built within the door of the\\nlarger one. The packet of letters was here, tied with a tape, and\\nsealed. Varin handed the packet to Daspry. The latter turned to the\\nbanker, and asked:\\n\\n“Is the check ready, Monsieur Andermatt?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And you have also the last document that you received from Louis\\nLacombe--the one that completes the plans of the sub-marine?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nThe exchange was made. Daspry pocketed the document and the checks, and\\noffered the packet of letters to Mon. Andermatt.\\n\\n“This is what you wanted, Monsieur.”\\n\\nThe banker hesitated a moment, as if he were afraid to touch those\\ncursed letters that he had sought so eagerly. Then, with a nervous\\nmovement, he took them. Close to me, I heard a moan. I grasped Madame\\nAndermatt’s hand. It was cold.\\n\\n“I believe, monsieur,” said Daspry to the banker, “that our business is\\nended. Oh! no thanks. It was only by a mere chance that I have been able\\nto do you a good turn. Good-night.”\\n\\nMon. Andermatt retired. He carried with him the letters written by his\\nwife to Louis Lacombe.\\n\\n“Marvelous!” exclaimed Daspry, delighted. “Everything is coming our\\nway. Now, we have only to close our little affair, comrade. You have the\\npapers?”\\n\\n“Here they are--all of them.”\\n\\nDaspry examined them carefully, and then placed them in his pocket.\\n\\n“Quite right. You have kept your word,” he said.\\n\\n“But---”\\n\\n“But what?”\\n\\n“The two checks? The money?” said Varin, eagerly.\\n\\n“Well, you have a great deal of assurance, my man. How dare you ask such\\na thing?”\\n\\n“I ask only what is due to me.”\\n\\n“Can you ask pay for returning papers that you stole? Well, I think\\nnot!”\\n\\nVarin was beside himself. He trembled with rage; his eyes were\\nbloodshot.\\n\\n“The money.... the twenty thousand....” he stammered.\\n\\n“Impossible! I need it myself.”\\n\\n“The money!”\\n\\n“Come, be reasonable, and don’t get excited. It won’t do you any good.”\\n\\nDaspry seized his arm so forcibly, that Varin uttered a cry of pain.\\nDaspry continued:\\n\\n“Now, you can go. The air will do you good. Perhaps you want me to show\\nyou the way. Ah! yes, we will go together to the vacant lot near here,\\nand I will show you a little mound of earth and stones and under it---”\\n\\n“That is false! That is false!”\\n\\n“Oh! no, it is true. That little iron plate with the seven spots on it\\ncame from there. Louis Lacombe always carried it, and you buried it with\\nthe body--and with some other things that will prove very interesting to\\na judge and jury.”\\n\\nVarin covered his face with his hands, and muttered:\\n\\n“All right, I am beaten. Say no more. But I want to ask you one\\nquestion. I should like to know---”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“Was there a little casket in the large safe?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Was it there on the night of 22 June?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“What did it contain?”\\n\\n“Everything that the Varin brothers had put in it--a very pretty\\ncollection of diamonds and pearls picked up here and there by the said\\nbrothers.”\\n\\n“And did you take it?”\\n\\n“Of course I did. Do you blame me?”\\n\\n“I understand.... it was the disappearance of that casket that caused my\\nbrother to kill himself.”\\n\\n“Probably. The disappearance of your correspondence was not a sufficient\\nmotive. But the disappearance of the casket....Is that all you wish to\\nask me?”\\n\\n“One thing more: your name?”\\n\\n“You ask that with an idea of seeking revenge.”\\n\\n“Parbleu! The tables may be turned. Today, you are on top. To-morrow---”\\n\\n“It will be you.”\\n\\n“I hope so. Your name?”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin!”\\n\\nThe man staggered, as though stunned by a heavy blow. Those two words\\nhad deprived him of all hope.\\n\\nDaspry laughed, and said:\\n\\n“Ah! did you imagine that a Monsieur Durand or Dupont could manage an\\naffair like this? No, it required the skill and cunning of Arsène Lupin.\\nAnd now that you have my name, go and prepare your revenge. Arsène Lupin\\nwill wait for you.”\\n\\nThen he pushed the bewildered Varin through the door.\\n\\n“Daspry! Daspry!” I cried, pushing aside the curtain. He ran to me.\\n\\n“What? What’s the matter?”\\n\\n“Madame Andermatt is ill.”\\n\\nHe hastened to her, caused her to inhale some salts, and, while caring\\nfor her, questioned me:\\n\\n“Well, what did it?”\\n\\n“The letters of Louis Lacombe that you gave to her husband.”\\n\\nHe struck his forehead and said:\\n\\n“Did she think that I could do such a thing!...But, of course she would.\\nImbecile that I am!”\\n\\nMadame Andermatt was now revived. Daspry took from his pocket a small\\npackage exactly similar to the one that Mon. Andermatt had carried away.\\n\\n“Here are your letters, Madame. These are the genuine letters.”\\n\\n“But.... the others?”\\n\\n“The others are the same, rewritten by me and carefully worded. Your\\nhusband will not find anything objectionable in them, and will never\\nsuspect the substitution since they were taken from the safe in his\\npresence.”\\n\\n“But the handwriting---”\\n\\n“There is no handwriting that cannot be imitated.”\\n\\nShe thanked him in the same words she might have used to a man in her\\nown social circle, so I concluded that she had not witnessed the final\\nscene between Varin and Arsène Lupin. But the surprising revelation\\ncaused me considerable embarrassment. Lupin! My club companion was none\\nother than Arsène Lupin. I could not realize it. But he said, quite at\\nhis ease:\\n\\n“You can say farewell to Jean Daspry.”\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\n“Yes, Jean Daspry is going on a long journey. I shall send him to\\nMorocco. There, he may find a death worthy of him. I may say that that\\nis his expectation.”\\n\\n“But Arsène Lupin will remain?”\\n\\n“Oh! Decidedly. Arsène Lupin is simply at the threshold of his career,\\nand he expects---”\\n\\nI was impelled by curiosity to interrupt him, and, leading him away from\\nthe hearing of Madame Andermatt, I asked:\\n\\n“Did you discover the smaller safe yourself--the one that held the\\nletters?”\\n\\n“Yes, after a great deal of trouble. I found it yesterday afternoon\\nwhile you were asleep. And yet, God knows it was simple enough! But\\nthe simplest things are the ones that usually escape our notice.” Then,\\nshowing me the seven-of-hearts, he added: “Of course I had guessed that,\\nin order to open the larger safe, this card must be placed on the sword\\nof the mosaic king.”\\n\\n“How did you guess that?”\\n\\n“Quite easily. Through private information, I knew that fact when I came\\nhere on the evening of 22 June---”\\n\\n“After you left me---”\\n\\n“Yes, after turning the subject of our conversation to stories of crime\\nand robbery which were sure to reduce you to such a nervous condition\\nthat you would not leave your bed, but would allow me to complete my\\nsearch uninterrupted.”\\n\\n“The scheme worked perfectly.”\\n\\n“Well, I knew when I came here that there was a casket concealed in a\\nsafe with a secret lock, and that the seven-of-hearts was the key\\nto that lock. I had merely to place the card upon the spot that was\\nobviously intended for it. An hour’s examination showed me where the\\nspot was.”\\n\\n“One hour!”\\n\\n“Observe the fellow in mosaic.”\\n\\n“The old emperor?”\\n\\n“That old emperor is an exact representation of the king of hearts on\\nall playing cards.”\\n\\n“That’s right. But how does the seven of hearts open the larger safe at\\none time and the smaller safe at another time? And why did you open only\\nthe larger safe in the first instance? I mean on the night of 22 June.”\\n\\n“Why? Because I always placed the seven of hearts in the same way. I\\nnever changed the position. But, yesterday, I observed that by reversing\\nthe card, by turning it upside down, the arrangement of the seven spots\\non the mosaic was changed.”\\n\\n“Parbleu!”\\n\\n“Of course, parbleu! But a person has to think of those things.”\\n\\n“There is something else: you did not know the history of those letters\\nuntil Madame Andermatt---”\\n\\n“Spoke of them before me? No. Because I found in the safe, besides\\nthe casket, nothing but the correspondence of the two brothers which\\ndisclosed their treachery in regard to the plans.”\\n\\n“Then it was by chance that you were led, first, to investigate the\\nhistory of the two brothers, and then to search for the plans and\\ndocuments relating to the sub-marine?”\\n\\n“Simply by chance.”\\n\\n“For what purpose did you make the search?”\\n\\n“Mon Dieu!” exclaimed Daspry, laughing, “how deeply interested you are!”\\n\\n“The subject fascinates me.”\\n\\n“Very well, presently, after I have escorted Madame Andermatt to a\\ncarriage, and dispatched a short story to the _Echo de France_, I will\\nreturn and tell you all about it.”\\n\\nHe sat down and wrote one of those short, clear-cut articles which\\nserved to amuse and mystify the public. Who does not recall the\\nsensation that followed that article produced throughout the entire\\nworld?\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin has solved the problem recently submitted by Salvator.\\nHaving acquired possession of all the documents and original plans\\nof the engineer Louis Lacombe, he has placed them in the hands of\\nthe Minister of Marine, and he has headed a subscription list for the\\npurpose of presenting to the nation the first submarine constructed from\\nthose plans. His subscription is twenty thousand francs.”\\n\\n“Twenty thousand francs! The checks of Mon. Andermatt?” I exclaimed,\\nwhen he had given me the paper to read.\\n\\n“Exactly. It was quite right that Varin should redeem his treachery.”\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of Arsène Lupin. That is how\\nI learned that Jean Daspry, a member of my club, was none other than\\nArsène Lupin, gentleman-thief. That is how I formed very agreeable ties\\nof friendship with that famous man, and, thanks to the confidence\\nwith which he honored me, how I became his very humble and faithful\\nhistoriographer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. Madame Imbert’s Safe\\n\\n\\nAt three o’clock in the morning, there were still half a dozen carriages\\nin front of one of those small houses which form only the side of the\\nboulevard Berthier. The door of that house opened, and a number of\\nguests, male and female, emerged. The majority of them entered their\\ncarriages and were quickly driven away, leaving behind only two men who\\nwalked down Courcelles, where they parted, as one of them lived in that\\nstreet. The other decided to return on foot as far as the Porte-Maillot.\\nIt was a beautiful winter’s night, clear and cold; a night on which a\\nbrisk walk is agreeable and refreshing.\\n\\nBut, at the end of a few minutes, he had the disagreeable impression\\nthat he was being followed. Turning around, he saw a man skulking amongst\\nthe trees. He was not a coward; yet he felt it advisable to increase his\\nspeed. Then his pursuer commenced to run; and he deemed it prudent to\\ndraw his revolver and face him. But he had no time. The man rushed at\\nhim and attacked him violently. Immediately, they were engaged in a\\ndesperate struggle, wherein he felt that his unknown assailant had the\\nadvantage. He called for help, struggled, and was thrown down on a pile\\nof gravel, seized by the throat, and gagged with a handkerchief that his\\nassailant forced into his mouth. His eyes closed, and the man who\\nwas smothering him with his weight arose to defend himself against an\\nunexpected attack. A blow from a cane and a kick from a boot; the\\nman uttered two cries of pain, and fled, limping and cursing. Without\\ndeigning to pursue the fugitive, the new arrival stooped over the\\nprostrate man and inquired:\\n\\n“Are you hurt, monsieur?”\\n\\nHe was not injured, but he was dazed and unable to stand. His rescuer\\nprocured a carriage, placed him in it, and accompanied him to his house\\non the avenue de la Grande-Armée. On his arrival there, quite recovered,\\nhe overwhelmed his saviour with thanks.\\n\\n“I owe you my life, monsieur, and I shall not forget it. I do not wish\\nto alarm my wife at this time of night, but, to-morrow, she will be\\npleased to thank you personally. Come and breakfast with us. My name is\\nLudovic Imbert. May I ask yours?”\\n\\n“Certainly, monsieur.”\\n\\nAnd he handed Mon. Imbert a card bearing the name: “Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nAt that time, Arsène Lupin did not enjoy the celebrity which the Cahorn\\naffair, his escape from the Prison de la Santé, and other brilliant\\nexploits, afterwards gained for him. He had not even used the name of\\nArsène Lupin. The name was specially invented to designate the rescuer\\nof Mon. Imbert; that is to say, it was in that affair that Arsène\\nLupin was baptized. Fully armed and ready for the fray, it is true, but\\nlacking the resources and authority which command success, Arsène Lupin\\nwas then merely an apprentice in a profession wherein he soon became a\\nmaster.\\n\\nWith what a thrill of joy he recalled the invitation he received that\\nnight! At last, he had reached his goal! At last, he had undertaken\\na task worthy of his strength and skill! The Imbert millions! What a\\nmagnificent feast for an appetite like his!\\n\\nHe prepared a special toilet for the occasion; a shabby frock-coat,\\nbaggy trousers, a frayed silk hat, well-worn collar and cuffs, all quite\\ncorrect in form, but bearing the unmistakable stamp of poverty. His\\ncravat was a black ribbon pinned with a false diamond. Thus accoutred,\\nhe descended the stairs of the house in which he lived at Montmartre. At\\nthe third floor, without stopping, he rapped on a closed door with the\\nhead of his cane. He walked to the exterior boulevards. A tram-car was\\npassing. He boarded it, and some one who had been following him took a\\nseat beside him. It was the lodger who occupied the room on the third\\nfloor. A moment later, this man said to Lupin:\\n\\n“Well, governor?”\\n\\n“Well, it is all fixed.”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“I am going there to breakfast.”\\n\\n“You breakfast--there!”\\n\\n“Certainly. Why not? I rescued Mon. Ludovic Imbert from certain death\\nat your hands. Mon. Imbert is not devoid of gratitude. He invited me to\\nbreakfast.”\\n\\nThere was a brief silence. Then the other said:\\n\\n“But you are not going to throw up the scheme?”\\n\\n“My dear boy,” said Lupin, “When I arranged that little case of assault\\nand battery, when I took the trouble at three o’clock in the morning, to\\nrap you with my cane and tap you with my boot at the risk of injuring\\nmy only friend, it was not my intention to forego the advantages to be\\ngained from a rescue so well arranged and executed. Oh! no, not at all.”\\n\\n“But the strange rumors we hear about their fortune?”\\n\\n“Never mind about that. For six months, I have worked on this affair,\\ninvestigated it, studied it, questioned the servants, the money-lenders\\nand men of straw; for six months, I have shadowed the husband and wife.\\nConsequently, I know what I am talking about. Whether the fortune came\\nto them from old Brawford, as they pretend, or from some other source,\\nI do not care. I know that it is a reality; that it exists. And some day\\nit will be mine.”\\n\\n“Bigre! One hundred millions!”\\n\\n“Let us say ten, or even five--that is enough! They have a safe full\\nof bonds, and there will be the devil to pay if I can’t get my hands on\\nthem.”\\n\\nThe tram-car stopped at the Place de l’Etoile. The man whispered to\\nLupin:\\n\\n“What am I to do now?”\\n\\n“Nothing, at present. You will hear from me. There is no hurry.”\\n\\nFive minutes later, Arsène Lupin was ascending the magnificent flight\\nof stairs in the Imbert mansion, and Mon. Imbert introduced him to\\nhis wife. Madame Gervaise Imbert was a short plump woman, and very\\ntalkative. She gave Lupin a cordial welcome.\\n\\n“I desired that we should be alone to entertain our saviour,” she said.\\n\\nFrom the outset, they treated “our saviour” as an old and valued friend.\\nBy the time dessert was served, their friendship was well cemented, and\\nprivate confidences were being exchanged. Arsène related the story of\\nhis life, the life of his father as a magistrate, the sorrows of his\\nchildhood, and his present difficulties. Gervaise, in turn, spoke of\\nher youth, her marriage, the kindness of the aged Brawford, the hundred\\nmillions that she had inherited, the obstacles that prevented her from\\nobtaining the enjoyment of her inheritance, the moneys she had been\\nobliged to borrow at an exorbitant rate of interest, her endless\\ncontentions with Brawford’s nephews, and the litigation! the\\ninjunctions! in fact, everything!\\n\\n“Just think of it, Monsieur Lupin, the bonds are there, in my husband’s\\noffice, and if we detach a single coupon, we lose everything! They are\\nthere, in our safe, and we dare not touch them.”\\n\\nMonsieur Lupin shivered at the bare idea of his proximity to so much\\nwealth. Yet he felt quite certain that Monsieur Lupin would never suffer\\nfrom the same difficulty as his fair hostess who declared she dare not\\ntouch the money.\\n\\n“Ah! they are there!” he repeated, to himself; “they are there!”\\n\\nA friendship formed under such circumstances soon led to closer\\nrelations. When discreetly questioned, Arsène Lupin confessed his\\npoverty and distress. Immediately, the unfortunate young man was\\nappointed private secretary to the Imberts, husband and wife, at a\\nsalary of one hundred francs a month. He was to come to the house every\\nday and receive orders for his work, and a room on the second floor\\nwas set apart as his office. This room was directly over Mon. Imbert’s\\noffice.\\n\\nArsène soon realized that his position as secretary was essentially\\na sinecure. During the first two months, he had only four important\\nletters to recopy, and was called only once to Mon. Imbert’s office;\\nconsequently, he had only one opportunity to contemplate, officially,\\nthe Imbert safe. Moreover, he noticed that the secretary was not invited\\nto the social functions of the employer. But he did not complain, as he\\npreferred to remain, modestly, in the shade and maintain his peace and\\nfreedom.\\n\\nHowever, he was not wasting any time. From the beginning, he made\\nclandestine visits to Mon. Imbert’s office, and paid his respects to the\\nsafe, which was hermetically closed. It was an immense block of iron and\\nsteel, cold and stern in appearance, which could not be forced open\\nby the ordinary tools of the burglar’s trade. But Arsène Lupin was not\\ndiscouraged.\\n\\n“Where force fails, cunning prevails,” he said to himself. “The\\nessential thing is to be on the spot when the opportunity occurs. In the\\nmeantime, I must watch and wait.”\\n\\nHe made immediately some preliminary preparations. After careful\\nsoundings made upon the floor of his room, he introduced a lead pipe\\nwhich penetrated the ceiling of Mon. Imbert’s office at a point between\\nthe two screeds of the cornice. By means of this pipe, he hoped to see\\nand hear what transpired in the room below.\\n\\nHenceforth, he passed his days stretched at full length upon the floor.\\nHe frequently saw the Imberts holding a consultation in front of the\\nsafe, investigating books and papers. When they turned the combination\\nlock, he tried to learn the figures and the number of turns they made to\\nthe right and left. He watched their movements; he sought to catch their\\nwords. There was also a key necessary to complete the opening of the\\nsafe. What did they do with it? Did they hide it?\\n\\nOne day, he saw them leave the room without locking the safe. He\\ndescended the stairs quickly, and boldly entered the room. But they had\\nreturned.\\n\\n“Oh! excuse me,” he said, “I made a mistake in the door.”\\n\\n“Come in, Monsieur Lupin, come in,” cried Madame Imbert, “are you not at\\nhome here? We want your advice. What bonds should we sell? The foreign\\nsecurities or the government annuities?”\\n\\n“But the injunction?” said Lupin, with surprise.\\n\\n“Oh! it doesn’t cover all the bonds.”\\n\\nShe opened the door of the safe and withdrew a package of bonds. But her\\nhusband protested.\\n\\n“No, no, Gervaise, it would be foolish to sell the foreign bonds. They\\nare going up, whilst the annuities are as high as they ever will be.\\nWhat do you think, my dear friend?”\\n\\nThe dear friend had no opinion; yet he advised the sacrifice of the\\nannuities. Then she withdrew another package and, from it, she took\\na paper at random. It proved to be a three-per-cent annuity worth two\\nthousand francs. Ludovic placed the package of bonds in his pocket.\\nThat afternoon, accompanied by his secretary, he sold the annuities to a\\nstock-broker and realized forty-six thousand francs.\\n\\nWhatever Madame Imbert might have said about it, Arsène Lupin did not\\nfeel at home in the Imbert house. On the contrary, his position there\\nwas a peculiar one. He learned that the servants did not even know his\\nname. They called him “monsieur.” Ludovic always spoke of him in the\\nsame way: “You will tell monsieur. Has monsieur arrived?” Why that\\nmysterious appellation?\\n\\nMoreover, after their first outburst of enthusiasm, the Imberts seldom\\nspoke to him, and, although treating him with the consideration due to\\na benefactor, they gave him little or no attention. They appeared to\\nregard him as an eccentric character who did not like to be disturbed,\\nand they respected his isolation as if it were a stringent rule on his\\npart. On one occasion, while passing through the vestibule, he heard\\nMadame Imbert say to the two gentlemen:\\n\\n“He is such a barbarian!”\\n\\n“Very well,” he said to himself, “I am a barbarian.”\\n\\nAnd, without seeking to solve the question of their strange conduct, he\\nproceeded with the execution of his own plans. He had decided that he\\ncould not depend on chance, nor on the negligence of Madame Imbert, who\\ncarried the key of the safe, and who, on locking the safe, invariably\\nscattered the letters forming the combination of the lock. Consequently,\\nhe must act for himself.\\n\\nFinally, an incident precipitated matters; it was the vehement campaign\\ninstituted against the Imberts by certain newspapers that accused\\nthe Imberts of swindling. Arsène Lupin was present at certain family\\nconferences when this new vicissitude was discussed. He decided that if\\nhe waited much longer, he would lose everything. During the next five\\ndays, instead of leaving the house about six o’clock, according to his\\nusual habit, he locked himself in his room. It was supposed that he had\\ngone out. But he was lying on the floor surveying the office of Mon.\\nImbert. During those five evenings, the favorable opportunity that he\\nawaited did not take place. He left the house about midnight by a side\\ndoor to which he held the key.\\n\\nBut on the sixth day, he learned that the Imberts, actuated by the\\nmalevolent insinuations of their enemies, proposed to make an inventory\\nof the contents of the safe.\\n\\n“They will do it to-night,” thought Lupin.\\n\\nAnd truly, after dinner, Imbert and his wife retired to the office and\\ncommenced to examine the books of account and the securities contained\\nin the safe. Thus, one hour after another passed away. He heard the\\nservants go upstairs to their rooms. No one now remained on the first\\nfloor. Midnight! The Imberts were still at work.\\n\\n“I must get to work,” murmured Lupin.\\n\\nHe opened his window. It opened on a court. Outside, everything was\\ndark and quiet. He took from his desk a knotted rope, fastened it to\\nthe balcony in front of his window, and quietly descended as far as the\\nwindow below, which was that of the of Imbert’s office. He stood upon\\nthe balcony for a moment, motionless, with attentive ear and watchful\\neye, but the heavy curtains effectually concealed the interior of the\\nroom. He cautiously pushed on the double window. If no one had examined\\nit, it ought to yield to the slightest pressure, for, during the\\nafternoon, he had so fixed the bolt that it would not enter the staple.\\n\\nThe window yielded to his touch. Then, with infinite care, he pushed\\nit open sufficiently to admit his head. He parted the curtains a few\\ninches, looked in, and saw Mon. Imbert and his wife sitting in front\\nof the safe, deeply absorbed in their work and speaking softly to each\\nother at rare intervals.\\n\\nHe calculated the distance between him and them, considered the exact\\nmovements he would require to make in order to overcome them, one after\\nthe other, before they could call for help, and he was about to rush\\nupon them, when Madame Imbert said:\\n\\n“Ah! the room is getting quite cold. I am going to bed. And you, my\\ndear?”\\n\\n“I shall stay and finish.”\\n\\n“Finish! Why, that will take you all night.”\\n\\n“Not at all. An hour, at the most.”\\n\\nShe retired. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes passed. Arsène pushed the\\nwindow a little farther open. The curtains shook. He pushed once more.\\nMon. Imbert turned, and, seeing the curtains blown by the wind, he rose\\nto close the window.\\n\\nThere was not a cry, not the trace of struggle. With a few precise\\nmoments, and without causing him the least injury, Arsène stunned him,\\nwrapped the curtain about his head, bound him hand and foot, and did it\\nall in such a manner that Mon. Imbert had no opportunity to recognize\\nhis assailant.\\n\\nQuickly, he approached the safe, seized two packages that he placed\\nunder his arm, left the office, and opened the servants’ gate. A\\ncarriage was stationed in the street.\\n\\n“Take that, first--and follow me,” he said to the coachman. He returned\\nto the office, and, in two trips, they emptied the safe. Then Arsène\\nwent to his own room, removed the rope, and all other traces of his\\nclandestine work.\\n\\nA few hours later, Arsène Lupin and his assistant examined the stolen\\ngoods. Lupin was not disappointed, as he had foreseen that the wealth of\\nthe Imberts had been greatly exaggerated. It did not consist of hundreds\\nof millions, nor even tens of millions. Yet it amounted to a very\\nrespectable sum, and Lupin expressed his satisfaction.\\n\\n“Of course,” he said, “there will be a considerable loss when we come\\nto sell the bonds, as we will have to dispose of them surreptitiously\\nat reduced prices. In the meantime, they will rest quietly in my desk\\nawaiting a propitious moment.”\\n\\nArsène saw no reason why he should not go to the Imbert house the next\\nday. But a perusal of the morning papers revealed this startling fact:\\nLudovic and Gervaise Imbert had disappeared.\\n\\nWhen the officers of the law seized the safe and opened it, they found\\nthere what Arsène Lupin had left--nothing.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nSuch are the facts; and I learned the sequel to them, one day, when\\nArsène Lupin was in a confidential mood. He was pacing to and fro in my\\nroom, with a nervous step and a feverish eye that were unusual to him.\\n\\n“After all,” I said to him, “it was your most successful venture.”\\n\\nWithout making a direct reply, he said:\\n\\n“There are some impenetrable secrets connected with that affair; some\\nobscure points that escape my comprehension. For instance: What\\ncaused their flight? Why did they not take advantage of the help I\\nunconsciously gave them? It would have been so simple to say: ‘The\\nhundred millions were in the safe. They are no longer there, because\\nthey have been stolen.’”\\n\\n“They lost their nerve.”\\n\\n“Yes, that is it--they lost their nerve...On the other hand, it is\\ntrue---”\\n\\n“What is true?”\\n\\n“Oh! nothing.”\\n\\nWhat was the meaning of Lupin’s reticence? It was quite obvious that he\\nhad not told me everything; there was something he was loath to tell.\\nHis conduct puzzled me. It must indeed be a very serious matter to cause\\nsuch a man as Arsène Lupin even a momentary hesitation. I threw out a\\nfew questions at random.\\n\\n“Have you seen them since?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“And have you never experienced the slightest degree of pity for those\\nunfortunate people?”\\n\\n“I!” he exclaimed, with a start.\\n\\nHis sudden excitement astonished me. Had I touched him on a sore spot? I\\ncontinued:\\n\\n“Of course. If you had not left them alone, they might have been able to\\nface the danger, or, at least, made their escape with full pockets.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” he said, indignantly. “I suppose you have an idea\\nthat my soul should be filled with remorse?”\\n\\n“Call it remorse or regrets--anything you like---”\\n\\n“They are not worth it.”\\n\\n“Have you no regrets or remorse for having stolen their fortune?”\\n\\n“What fortune?”\\n\\n“The packages of bonds you took from their safe.”\\n\\n“Oh! I stole their bonds, did I? I deprived them of a portion of their\\nwealth? Is that my crime? Ah! my dear boy, you do not know the truth.\\nYou never imagined that those bonds were not worth the paper they were\\nwritten on. Those bonds were false--they were counterfeit--every one of\\nthem--do you understand? THEY WERE COUNTERFEIT!”\\n\\nI looked at him, astounded.\\n\\n“Counterfeit! The four or five millions?”\\n\\n“Yes, counterfeit!” he exclaimed, in a fit of rage. “Only so many scraps\\nof paper! I couldn’t raise a sou on the whole of them! And you ask me if\\nI have any remorse. _They_ are the ones who should have remorse and pity.\\nThey played me for a simpleton; and I fell into their trap. I was their\\nlatest victim, their most stupid gull!”\\n\\nHe was affected by genuine anger--the result of malice and wounded\\npride. He continued:\\n\\n“From start to finish, I got the worst of it. Do you know the part I\\nplayed in that affair, or rather the part they made me play? That of\\nAndré Brawford! Yes, my boy, that is the truth, and I never suspected\\nit. It was not until afterwards, on reading the newspapers, that the\\nlight finally dawned in my stupid brain. Whilst I was posing as his\\n“saviour,” as the gentleman who had risked his life to rescue Mon.\\nImbert from the clutches of an assassin, they were passing me off as\\nBrawford. Wasn’t that splendid? That eccentric individual who had a\\nroom on the second floor, that barbarian that was exhibited only at a\\ndistance, was Brawford, and Brawford was I! Thanks to me, and to the\\nconfidence that I inspired under the name of Brawford, they were enabled\\nto borrow money from the bankers and other money-lenders. Ha! what an\\nexperience for a novice! And I swear to you that I shall profit by the\\nlesson!”\\n\\nHe stopped, seized my arm, and said to me, in a tone of exasperation:\\n\\n“My dear fellow, at this very moment, Gervaise Imbert owes me fifteen\\nhundred francs.”\\n\\nI could not refrain from laughter, his rage was so grotesque. He was\\nmaking a mountain out of a molehill. In a moment, he laughed himself,\\nand said:\\n\\n“Yes, my boy, fifteen hundred francs. You must know that I had not\\nreceived one sou of my promised salary, and, more than that, she had\\nborrowed from me the sum of fifteen hundred francs. All my youthful\\nsavings! And do you know why? To devote the money to charity! I am\\ngiving you a straight story. She wanted it for some poor people she was\\nassisting--unknown to her husband. And my hard-earned money was wormed\\nout of me by that silly pretense! Isn’t it amusing, hein? Arsène Lupin\\ndone out of fifteen hundred francs by the fair lady from whom he stole\\nfour millions in counterfeit bonds! And what a vast amount of time and\\npatience and cunning I expended to achieve that result! It was the first\\ntime in my life that I was played for a fool, and I frankly confess that\\nI was fooled that time to the queen’s taste!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. The Black Pearl\\n\\n\\nA violent ringing of the bell awakened the concierge of number nine,\\navenue Hoche. She pulled the doorstring, grumbling:\\n\\n“I thought everybody was in. It must be three o’clock!”\\n\\n“Perhaps it is some one for the doctor,” muttered her husband.\\n\\nAt that moment, a voice inquired:\\n\\n“Doctor Harel .... what floor?” \\n\\n“Third floor, left. But the doctor won’t go out at night.”\\n\\n“He must go to-night.”\\n\\nThe visitor entered the vestibule, ascended to the first floor, the\\nsecond, the third, and, without stopping at the doctor’s door, he\\ncontinued to the fifth floor. There, he tried two keys. One of them\\nfitted the lock.\\n\\n“Ah! good!” he murmured, “that simplifies the business wonderfully.\\nBut before I commence work I had better arrange for my retreat. Let me\\nsee.... have I had sufficient time to rouse the doctor and be dismissed\\nby him? Not yet.... a few minutes more.”\\n\\nAt the end of ten minutes, he descended the stairs, grumbling noisily\\nabout the doctor. The concierge opened the door for him and heard it\\nclick behind him. But the door did not lock, as the man had quickly\\ninserted a piece of iron in the lock in such a manner that the bolt\\ncould not enter. Then, quietly, he entered the house again, unknown to\\nthe concierge. In case of alarm, his retreat was assured. Noiselessly,\\nhe ascended to the fifth floor once more. In the antechamber, by the\\nlight of his electric lantern, he placed his hat and overcoat on one\\nof the chairs, took a seat on another, and covered his heavy shoes with\\nfelt slippers.\\n\\n“Ouf! Here I am--and how simple it was! I wonder why more people do not\\nadopt the profitable and pleasant occupation of burglar. With a little\\ncare and reflection, it becomes a most delightful profession. Not too\\nquiet and monotonous, of course, as it would then become wearisome.”\\n\\nHe unfolded a detailed plan of the apartment.\\n\\n“Let me commence by locating myself. Here, I see the vestibule in which\\nI am sitting. On the street front, the drawing-room, the boudoir and\\ndining-room. Useless to waste any time there, as it appears that the\\ncountess has a deplorable taste.... not a bibelot of any value!...Now,\\nlet’s get down to business!... Ah! here is a corridor; it must lead to\\nthe bed chambers. At a distance of three metres, I should come to the\\ndoor of the wardrobe-closet which connects with the chamber of the\\ncountess.” He folded his plan, extinguished his lantern, and proceeded\\ndown the corridor, counting his distance, thus:\\n\\n“One metre.... two metres.... three metres....Here is the door....Mon\\nDieu, how easy it is! Only a small, simple bolt now separates me from\\nthe chamber, and I know that the bolt is located exactly one metre,\\nforty-three centimeters, from the floor. So that, thanks to a small\\nincision I am about to make, I can soon get rid of the bolt.”\\n\\nHe drew from his pocket the necessary instruments. Then the following\\nidea occurred to him:\\n\\n“Suppose, by chance, the door is not bolted. I will try it first.”\\n\\nHe turned the knob, and the door opened.\\n\\n“My brave Lupin, surely fortune favors you....What’s to be done now?\\nYou know the situation of the rooms; you know the place in which the\\ncountess hides the black pearl. Therefore, in order to secure the black\\npearl, you have simply to be more silent than silence, more invisible\\nthan darkness itself.”\\n\\nArsène Lupin was employed fully a half-hour in opening the second\\ndoor--a glass door that led to the countess’ bedchamber. But he\\naccomplished it with so much skill and precaution, that even had\\nthe countess been awake, she would not have heard the slightest sound.\\nAccording to the plan of the rooms, that he holds, he has merely to pass\\naround a reclining chair and, beyond that, a small table close to the\\nbed. On the table, there was a box of letter-paper, and the black pearl\\nwas concealed in that box. He stooped and crept cautiously over the\\ncarpet, following the outlines of the reclining-chair. When he reached\\nthe extremity of it, he stopped in order to repress the throbbing of\\nhis heart. Although he was not moved by any sense of fear, he found it\\nimpossible to overcome the nervous anxiety that one usually feels in the\\nmidst of profound silence. That circumstance astonished him, because he\\nhad passed through many more solemn moments without the slightest trace\\nof emotion. No danger threatened him. Then why did his heart throb like\\nan alarm-bell? Was it that sleeping woman who affected him? Was it the\\nproximity of another pulsating heart?\\n\\nHe listened, and thought he could discern the rhythmical breathing of a\\nperson asleep. It gave him confidence, like the presence of a friend.\\nHe sought and found the armchair; then, by slow, cautious movements,\\nadvanced toward the table, feeling ahead of him with outstretched arm.\\nHis right had touched one of the feet of the table. Ah! now, he had\\nsimply to rise, take the pearl, and escape. That was fortunate, as his\\nheart was leaping in his breast like a wild beast, and made so much\\nnoise that he feared it would waken the countess. By a powerful effort\\nof the will, he subdued the wild throbbing of his heart, and was about\\nto rise from the floor when his left hand encountered, lying on the\\nfloor, an object which he recognized as a candlestick--an overturned\\ncandlestick. A moment later, his hand encountered another object:\\na clock--one of those small traveling clocks, covered with\\nleather.-------\\n\\nWell! What had happened? He could not understand. That candlestick, that\\nclock; why were those articles not in their accustomed places? Ah! what\\nhad happened in the dread silence of the night?\\n\\nSuddenly a cry escaped him. He had touched--oh! some strange,\\nunutterable thing! “No! no!” he thought, “it cannot be. It is some\\nfantasy of my excited brain.” For twenty seconds, thirty seconds, he\\nremained motionless, terrified, his forehead bathed with perspiration,\\nand his fingers still retained the sensation of that dreadful contact.\\n\\nMaking a desperate effort, he ventured to extend his arm again. Once\\nmore, his hand encountered that strange, unutterable thing. He felt\\nit. He must feel it and find out what it is. He found that it was hair,\\nhuman hair, and a human face; and that face was cold, almost icy.\\n\\nHowever frightful the circumstances may be, a man like Arsène Lupin\\ncontrols himself and commands the situation as soon as he learns what it\\nis. So, Arsène Lupin quickly brought his lantern into use. A woman\\nwas lying before him, covered with blood. Her neck and shoulders\\nwere covered with gaping wounds. He leaned over her and made a closer\\nexamination. She was dead.\\n\\n“Dead! Dead!” he repeated, with a bewildered air.\\n\\nHe stared at those fixed eyes, that grim mouth, that livid flesh,\\nand that blood--all that blood which had flowed over the carpet and\\ncongealed there in thick, black spots. He arose and turned on the\\nelectric lights. Then he beheld all the marks of a desperate struggle.\\nThe bed was in a state of great disorder. On the floor, the candlestick,\\nand the clock, with the hands pointing to twenty minutes after eleven;\\nthen, further away, an overturned chair; and, everywhere, there was\\nblood, spots of blood and pools of blood.\\n\\n“And the black pearl?” he murmured.\\n\\nThe box of letter-paper was in its place. He opened it, eagerly. The\\njewel-case was there, but it was empty.\\n\\n“Fichtre!” he muttered. “You boasted of your good fortune much too soon,\\nmy friend Lupin. With the countess lying cold and dead, and the black\\npearl vanished, the situation is anything but pleasant. Get out of here\\nas soon as you can, or you may get into serious trouble.”\\n\\nYet, he did not move.\\n\\n“Get out of here? Yes, of course. Any person would, except Arsène Lupin.\\nHe has something better to do. Now, to proceed in an orderly way. At\\nall events, you have a clear conscience. Let us suppose that you are\\nthe commissary of police and that you are proceeding to make an inquiry\\nconcerning this affair----Yes, but in order to do that, I require a\\nclearer brain. Mine is muddled like a ragout.”\\n\\nHe tumbled into an armchair, with his clenched hands pressed against his\\nburning forehead.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nThe murder of the avenue Hoche is one of those which have recently\\nsurprised and puzzled the Parisian public, and, certainly, I should\\nnever have mentioned the affair if the veil of mystery had not been\\nremoved by Arsène Lupin himself. No one knew the exact truth of the\\ncase.\\n\\nWho did not know--from having met her in the Bois--the fair Léotine\\nZalti, the once-famous cantatrice, wife and widow of the Count\\nd’Andillot; the Zalti, whose luxury dazzled all Paris some twenty years\\nago; the Zalti who acquired an European reputation for the magnificence\\nof her diamonds and pearls? It was said that she wore upon her shoulders\\nthe capital of several banking houses and the gold mines of numerous\\nAustralian companies. Skilful jewelers worked for Zalti as they had\\nformerly wrought for kings and queens. And who does not remember the\\ncatastrophe in which all that wealth was swallowed up? Of all that\\nmarvelous collection, nothing remained except the famous black pearl.\\nThe black pearl! That is to say a fortune, if she had wished to part\\nwith it.\\n\\nBut she preferred to keep it, to live in a commonplace apartment with\\nher companion, her cook, and a man-servant, rather than sell that\\ninestimable jewel. There was a reason for it; a reason she was not\\nafraid to disclose: the black pearl was the gift of an emperor! Almost\\nruined, and reduced to the most mediocre existence, she remained\\nfaithful to the companion of her happy and brilliant youth. The black\\npearl never left her possession. She wore it during the day, and, at\\nnight, concealed it in a place known to her alone.\\n\\nAll these facts, being republished in the columns of the public press,\\nserved to stimulate curiosity; and, strange to say, but quite obvious\\nto those who have the key to the mystery, the arrest of the presumed\\nassassin only complicated the question and prolonged the excitement. Two\\ndays later, the newspapers published the following item:\\n\\n“Information has reached us of the arrest of Victor Danègre, the servant\\nof the Countess d’Andillot. The evidence against him is clear and\\nconvincing. On the silken sleeve of his liveried waistcoat, which chief\\ndetective Dudouis found in his garret between the mattresses of his bed,\\nseveral spots of blood were discovered. In addition, a cloth-covered\\nbutton was missing from that garment, and this button was found beneath\\nthe bed of the victim.\\n\\n“It is supposed that, after dinner, in place of going to his own room,\\nDanègre slipped into the wardrobe-closet, and, through the glass door,\\nhad seen the countess hide the precious black pearl. This is simply\\na theory, as yet unverified by any evidence. There is, also, another\\nobscure point. At seven o’clock in the morning, Danègre went to the\\ntobacco-shop on the Boulevard de Courcelles; the concierge and the\\nshop-keeper both affirm this fact. On the other hand, the countess’\\ncompanion and cook, who sleep at the end of the hall, both declare that,\\nwhen they arose at eight o’clock, the door of the antechamber and the\\ndoor of the kitchen were locked. These two persons have been in the\\nservice of the countess for twenty years, and are above suspicion. The\\nquestion is: How did Danègre leave the apartment? Did he have another\\nkey? These are matters that the police will investigate.”\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, the police investigation threw no light on the\\nmystery. It was learned that Victor Danègre was a dangerous criminal, a\\ndrunkard and a debauchee. But, as they proceeded with the investigation,\\nthe mystery deepened and new complications arose. In the first place,\\na young woman, Mlle. De Sinclèves, the cousin and sole heiress of the\\ncountess, declared that the countess, a month before her death, had\\nwritten a letter to her and in it described the manner in which the\\nblack pearl was concealed. The letter disappeared the day after she\\nreceived it. Who had stolen it?\\n\\nAgain, the concierge related how she had opened the door for a person\\nwho had inquired for Doctor Harel. On being questioned, the doctor\\ntestified that no one had rung his bell. Then who was that person? An\\naccomplice?\\n\\nThe theory of an accomplice was thereupon adopted by the press and\\npublic, and also by Ganimard, the famous detective.\\n\\n“Lupin is at the bottom of this affair,” he said to the judge.\\n\\n“Bah!” exclaimed the judge, “you have Lupin on the brain. You see him\\neverywhere.”\\n\\n“I see him everywhere, because he is everywhere.”\\n\\n“Say rather that you see him every time you encounter something you\\ncannot explain. Besides, you overlook the fact that the crime was\\ncommitted at twenty minutes past eleven in the evening, as is shown\\nby the clock, while the nocturnal visit, mentioned by the concierge,\\noccurred at three o’clock in the morning.”\\n\\nOfficers of the law frequently form a hasty conviction as to the guilt\\nof a suspected person, and then distort all subsequent discoveries\\nto conform to their established theory. The deplorable antecedents of\\nVictor Danègre, habitual criminal, drunkard and rake, influenced\\nthe judge, and despite the fact that nothing new was discovered in\\ncorroboration of the early clues, his official opinion remained firm and\\nunshaken. He closed his investigation, and, a few weeks later, the trial\\ncommenced. It proved to be slow and tedious. The judge was listless,\\nand the public prosecutor presented the case in a careless manner. Under\\nthose circumstances, Danègre’s counsel had an easy task. He pointed out\\nthe defects and inconsistencies of the case for the prosecution, and\\nargued that the evidence was quite insufficient to convict the accused.\\nWho had made the key, the indispensable key without which Danègre, on\\nleaving the apartment, could not have locked the door behind him? Who\\nhad ever seen such a key, and what had become of it? Who had seen the\\nassassin’s knife, and where is it now?\\n\\n“In any event,” argued the prisoner’s counsel, “the prosecution must\\nprove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the prisoner committed the\\nmurder. The prosecution must show that the mysterious individual who\\nentered the house at three o’clock in the morning is not the guilty\\nparty. To be sure, the clock indicated eleven o’clock. But what of that?\\nI contend, that proves nothing. The assassin could turn the hands of the\\nclock to any hour he pleased, and thus deceive us in regard to the exact\\nhour of the crime.”\\n\\nVictor Danègre was acquitted.\\n\\nHe left the prison on Friday about dusk in the evening, weak and\\ndepressed by his six months’ imprisonment. The inquisition, the\\nsolitude, the trial, the deliberations of the jury, combined to fill\\nhim with a nervous fear. At night, he had been afflicted with terrible\\nnightmares and haunted by weird visions of the scaffold. He was a mental\\nand physical wreck.\\n\\nUnder the assumed name of Anatole Dufour, he rented a small room on the\\nheights of Montmartre, and lived by doing odd jobs wherever he could\\nfind them. He led a pitiful existence. Three times, he obtained regular\\nemployment, only to be recognized and then discharged. Sometimes, he\\nhad an idea that men were following him--detectives, no doubt, who were\\nseeking to trap and denounce him. He could almost feel the strong hand\\nof the law clutching him by the collar.\\n\\nOne evening, as he was eating his dinner at a neighboring restaurant,\\na man entered and took a seat at the same table. He was a person about\\nforty years of age, and wore a frock-coat of doubtful cleanliness. He\\nordered soup, vegetables, and a bottle of wine. After he had finished\\nhis soup, he turned his eyes on Danègre, and gazed at him intently.\\nDanègre winced. He was certain that this was one of the men who had\\nbeen following him for several weeks. What did he want? Danègre tried\\nto rise, but failed. His limbs refused to support him. The man poured\\nhimself a glass of wine, and then filled Danègre’s glass. The man raised\\nhis glass, and said:\\n\\n“To your health, Victor Danègre.”\\n\\nVictor started in alarm, and stammered:\\n\\n“I!....I!.... no, no....I swear to you....”\\n\\n“You will swear what? That you are not yourself? The servant of the\\ncountess?”\\n\\n“What servant? My name is Dufour. Ask the proprietor.”\\n\\n“Yes, Anatole Dufour to the proprietor of this restaurant, but Victor\\nDanègre to the officers of the law.”\\n\\n“That’s not true! Some one has lied to you.”\\n\\nThe new-comer took a card from his pocket and handed it to Victor, who\\nread on it: “Grimaudan, ex-inspector of the detective force. Private\\nbusiness transacted.” Victor shuddered as he said:\\n\\n“You are connected with the police?”\\n\\n“No, not now, but I have a liking for the business and I continue to\\nwork at it in a manner more--profitable. From time to time I strike upon\\na golden opportunity--such as your case presents.”\\n\\n“My case?”\\n\\n“Yes, yours. I assure you it is a most promising affair, provided you\\nare inclined to be reasonable.”\\n\\n“But if I am not reasonable?”\\n\\n“Oh! my good fellow, you are not in a position to refuse me anything I\\nmay ask.”\\n\\n“What is it.... you want?” stammered Victor, fearfully.\\n\\n“Well, I will inform you in a few words. I am sent by Mademoiselle de\\nSinclèves, the heiress of the Countess d’Andillot.”\\n\\n“What for?”\\n\\n“To recover the black pearl.”\\n\\n“Black pearl?”\\n\\n“That you stole.”\\n\\n“But I haven’t got it.”\\n\\n“You have it.”\\n\\n“If I had, then I would be the assassin.”\\n\\n“You are the assassin.”\\n\\nDanègre showed a forced smile.\\n\\n“Fortunately for me, monsieur, the Assizecourt was not of your opinion.\\nThe jury returned an unanimous verdict of acquittal. And when a man has\\na clear conscience and twelve good men in his favor--”\\n\\nThe ex-inspector seized him by the arm and said:\\n\\n“No fine phrases, my boy. Now, listen to me and weigh my words\\ncarefully. You will find they are worthy of your consideration. Now,\\nDanègre, three weeks before the murder, you abstracted the cook’s key\\nto the servants’ door, and had a duplicate key made by a locksmith named\\nOutard, 244 rue Oberkampf.”\\n\\n“It’s a lie--it’s a lie!” growled Victor. “No person has seen that key.\\nThere is no such key.”\\n\\n“Here it is.”\\n\\nAfter a silence, Grimaudan continued:\\n\\n“You killed the countess with a knife purchased by you at the Bazar de\\nla Republique on the same day as you ordered the duplicate key. It has a\\ntriangular blade with a groove running from end to end.”\\n\\n“That is all nonsense. You are simply guessing at something you don’t\\nknow. No one ever saw the knife.”\\n\\n“Here it is.”\\n\\nVictor Danègre recoiled. The ex-inspector continued:\\n\\n“There are some spots of rust upon it. Shall I tell you how they came\\nthere?”\\n\\n“Well!.... you have a key and a knife. Who can prove that they belong to\\nme?”\\n\\n“The locksmith, and the clerk from whom you bought the knife. I have\\nalready refreshed their memories, and, when you confront them, they\\ncannot fail to recognize you.”\\n\\nHis speech was dry and hard, with a tone of firmness and precision.\\nDanègre was trembling with fear, and yet he struggled desperately to\\nmaintain an air of indifference.\\n\\n“Is that all the evidence you have?”\\n\\n“Oh! no, not at all. I have plenty more. For instance, after the crime,\\nyou went out the same way you had entered. But, in the centre of the\\nwardrobe-room, being seized by some sudden fear, you leaned against the\\nwall for support.”\\n\\n“How do you know that? No one could know such a thing,” argued the\\ndesperate man.\\n\\n“The police know nothing about it, of course. They never think of\\nlighting a candle and examining the walls. But if they had done so, they\\nwould have found on the white plaster a faint red spot, quite distinct,\\nhowever, to trace in it the imprint of your thumb which you had pressed\\nagainst the wall while it was wet with blood. Now, as you are well\\naware, under the Bertillon system, thumb-marks are one of the principal\\nmeans of identification.”\\n\\nVictor Danègre was livid; great drops of perspiration rolled down his\\nface and fell upon the table. He gazed, with a wild look, at the strange\\nman who had narrated the story of his crime as faithfully as if he had\\nbeen an invisible witness to it. Overcome and powerless, Victor bowed\\nhis head. He felt that it was useless to struggle against this marvelous\\nman. So he said:\\n\\n“How much will you give me, if I give you the pearl?”\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n“Oh! you are joking! Or do you mean that I should give you an article\\nworth thousands and hundreds of thousands and get nothing in return?”\\n\\n“You will get your life. Is that nothing?”\\n\\nThe unfortunate man shuddered. Then Grimaudan added, in a milder tone:\\n\\n“Come, Danègre, that pearl has no value in your hands. It is quite\\nimpossible for you to sell it; so what is the use of your keeping it?”\\n\\n“There are pawnbrokers.... and, some day, I will be able to get something\\nfor it.”\\n\\n“But that day may be too late.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because by that time you may be in the hands of the police, and,\\nwith the evidence that I can furnish--the knife, the key, the\\nthumb-mark--what will become of you?”\\n\\nVictor rested his head on his hands and reflected. He felt that he was\\nlost, irremediably lost, and, at the same time, a sense of weariness and\\ndepression overcame him. He murmured, faintly:\\n\\n“When must I give it to you?”\\n\\n“To-night---within an hour.”\\n\\n“If I refuse?”\\n\\n“If you refuse, I shall post this letter to the Procureur of the\\nRepublic; in which letter Mademoiselle de Sinclèves denounces you as the\\nassassin.”\\n\\nDanègre poured out two glasses of wine which he drank in rapid\\nsuccession, then, rising, said:\\n\\n“Pay the bill, and let us go. I have had enough of the cursed affair.”\\n\\nNight had fallen. The two men walked down the rue Lepic and followed\\nthe exterior boulevards in the direction of the Place de l’Etoile.\\nThey pursued their way in silence; Victor had a stooping carriage and a\\ndejected face. When they reached the Parc Monceau, he said:\\n\\n“We are near the house.”\\n\\n“Parbleu! You only left the house once, before your arrest, and that was\\nto go to the tobacco-shop.”\\n\\n“Here it is,” said Danègre, in a dull voice.\\n\\nThey passed along the garden wall of the countess’ house, and crossed a\\nstreet on a corner of which stood the tobacco-shop. A few steps further\\non, Danègre stopped; his limbs shook beneath him, and he sank to a\\nbench.\\n\\n“Well! what now?” demanded his companion.\\n\\n“It is there.”\\n\\n“Where? Come, now, no nonsense!”\\n\\n“There--in front of us.”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“Between two paving-stones.”\\n\\n“Which?”\\n\\n“Look for it.”\\n\\n“Which stones?”\\n\\nVictor made no reply.\\n\\n“Ah; I see!” exclaimed Grimaudan, “you want me to pay for the\\ninformation.”\\n\\n“No.... but....I am afraid I will starve to death.”\\n\\n“So! that is why you hesitate. Well, I’ll not be hard on you. How much\\ndo you want?”\\n\\n“Enough to buy a steerage pass to America.”\\n\\n“All right.”\\n\\n“And a hundred francs to keep me until I get work there.”\\n\\n“You shall have two hundred. Now, speak.”\\n\\n“Count the paving-stones to the right from the sewer-hole. The pearl is\\nbetween the twelfth and thirteenth.”\\n\\n“In the gutter?”\\n\\n“Yes, close to the sidewalk.”\\n\\nGrimaudan glanced around to see if anyone were looking. Some tram-cars\\nand pedestrians were passing. But, bah, they will not suspect anything.\\nHe opened his pocketknife and thrust it between the twelfth and\\nthirteenth stones.\\n\\n“And if it is not there?” he said to Victor.\\n\\n“It must be there, unless someone saw me stoop down and hide it.”\\n\\nCould it be possible that the black pearl had been cast into the mud\\nand filth of the gutter to be picked up by the first comer? The black\\npearl--a fortune!\\n\\n“How far down?” he asked.\\n\\n“About ten centimetres.”\\n\\nHe dug up the wet earth. The point of his knife struck something. He\\nenlarged the hole with his finger. Then he abstracted the black pearl\\nfrom its filthy hiding-place.\\n\\n“Good! Here are your two hundred francs. I will send you the ticket for\\nAmerica.”\\n\\nOn the following day, this article was published in the _Echo de\\nFrance_, and was copied by the leading newspapers throughout the world:\\n\\n  “Yesterday, the famous black pearl came into the possession of\\n  Arsène Lupin, who recovered it from the murderer of the Countess\\n  d’Andillot. In a short time, fac-similes of that precious jewel\\n  will be exhibited in London, St. Petersburg, Calcutta, Buenos Ayres\\n  and New York.\\n\\n  “Arsène Lupin will be pleased to consider all propositions\\n  submitted to him through his agents.”\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\n“And that is how crime is always punished and virtue rewarded,” said\\nArsène Lupin, after he had told me the foregoing history of the black\\npearl.\\n\\n“And that is how you, under the assumed name of Grimaudan, ex-inspector\\nof detectives, were chosen by fate to deprive the criminal of the\\nbenefit of his crime.”\\n\\n“Exactly. And I confess that the affair gives me infinite satisfaction\\nand pride. The forty minutes that I passed in the apartment of the\\nCountess d’Andillot, after learning of her death, were the most\\nthrilling and absorbing moments of my life. In those forty minutes,\\ninvolved as I was in a most dangerous plight, I calmly studied the scene\\nof the murder and reached the conclusion that the crime must have been\\ncommitted by one of the house servants. I also decided that, in order\\nto get the pearl, that servant must be arrested, and so I left the\\nwainscoat button; it was necessary, also, for me to hold some convincing\\nevidence of his guilt, so I carried away the knife which I found upon\\nthe floor, and the key which I found in the lock. I closed and\\nlocked the door, and erased the finger-marks from the plaster in the\\nwardrobe-closet. In my opinion, that was one of those flashes--”\\n\\n“Of genius,” I said, interrupting.\\n\\n“Of genius, if you wish. But, I flatter myself, it would not have\\noccurred to the average mortal. To frame, instantly, the two elements of\\nthe problem--an arrest and an acquittal; to make use of the formidable\\nmachinery of the law to crush and humble my victim, and reduce him to a\\ncondition in which, when free, he would be certain to fall into the trap\\nI was laying for him!”\\n\\n“Poor devil--”\\n\\n“Poor devil, do you say? Victor Danègre, the assassin! He might have\\ndescended to the lowest depths of vice and crime, if he had retained the\\nblack pearl. Now, he lives! Think of that: Victor Danègre is alive!”\\n\\n“And you have the black pearl.”\\n\\nHe took it out of one of the secret pockets of his wallet, examined it,\\ngazed at it tenderly, and caressed it with loving fingers, and sighed,\\nas he said:\\n\\n“What cold Russian prince, what vain and foolish rajah may some day\\npossess this priceless treasure! Or, perhaps, some American millionaire\\nis destined to become the owner of this morsel of exquisite beauty that\\nonce adorned the fair bosom of Leontine Zalti, the Countess d’Andillot.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\\n\\n\\n“It is really remarkable, Velmont, what a close resemblance you bear to\\nArsène Lupin!”\\n\\n“How do you know?”\\n\\n“Oh! like everyone else, from photographs, no two of which are alike,\\nbut each of them leaves the impression of a face.... something like\\nyours.”\\n\\nHorace Velmont displayed some vexation.\\n\\n“Quite so, my dear Devanne. And, believe me, you are not the first one\\nwho has noticed it.”\\n\\n“It is so striking,” persisted Devanne, “that if you had not been\\nrecommended to me by my cousin d’Estevan, and if you were not the\\ncelebrated artist whose beautiful marine views I so admire, I have no\\ndoubt I should have warned the police of your presence in Dieppe.”\\n\\nThis sally was greeted with an outburst of laughter. The large\\ndining-hall of the Château de Thibermesnil contained on this occasion,\\nbesides Velmont, the following guests: Father Gélis, the parish priest,\\nand a dozen officers whose regiments were quartered in the vicinity and\\nwho had accepted the invitation of the banker Georges Devanne and his\\nmother. One of the officers then remarked:\\n\\n“I understand that an exact description of Arsène Lupin has been\\nfurnished to all the police along this coast since his daring exploit on\\nthe Paris-Havre express.”\\n\\n“I suppose so,” said Devanne. “That was three months ago; and a week\\nlater, I made the acquaintance of our friend Velmont at the casino, and,\\nsince then, he has honored me with several visits--an agreeable preamble\\nto a more serious visit that he will pay me one of these days--or,\\nrather, one of these nights.”\\n\\nThis speech evoked another round of laughter, and the guests then passed\\ninto the ancient “Hall of the Guards,” a vast room with a high ceiling,\\nwhich occupied the entire lower part of the Tour Guillaume--William’s\\nTower--and wherein Georges Devanne had collected the incomparable\\ntreasures which the lords of Thibermesnil had accumulated through\\nmany centuries. It contained ancient chests, credences, andirons and\\nchandeliers. The stone walls were overhung with magnificent tapestries.\\nThe deep embrasures of the four windows were furnished with benches, and\\nthe Gothic windows were composed of small panes of colored glass set\\nin a leaden frame. Between the door and the window to the left stood\\nan immense bookcase of Renaissance style, on the pediment of which, in\\nletters of gold, was the word “Thibermesnil,” and, below it, the proud\\nfamily device: “Fais ce que veulx” (Do what thou wishest). When the\\nguests had lighted their cigars, Devanne resumed the conversation.\\n\\n“And remember, Velmont, you have no time to lose; in fact, to-night is\\nthe last chance you will have.”\\n\\n“How so?” asked the painter, who appeared to regard the affair as a\\njoke. Devanne was about to reply, when his mother mentioned to him to\\nkeep silent, but the excitement of the occasion and a desire to interest\\nhis guests urged him to speak.\\n\\n“Bah!” he murmured. “I can tell it now. It won’t do any harm.”\\n\\nThe guests drew closer, and he commenced to speak with the satisfied air\\nof a man who has an important announcement to make.\\n\\n“To-morrow afternoon at four o’clock, Sherlock Holmes, the famous\\nEnglish detective, for whom such a thing as mystery does not exist;\\nSherlock Holmes, the most remarkable solver of enigmas the world has\\never known, that marvelous man who would seem to be the creation of a\\nromantic novelist--Sherlock Holmes will be my guest!”\\n\\nImmediately, Devanne was the target of numerous eager questions. “Is\\nSherlock Holmes really coming?” “Is it so serious as that?” “Is Arsène\\nLupin really in this neighborhood?”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin and his band are not far away. Besides the robbery of the\\nBaron Cahorn, he is credited with the thefts at Montigny, Gruchet and\\nCrasville. And now it is my turn.”\\n\\n“Has he sent you a warning, as he did to Baron Cahorn?”\\n\\n“No,” replied Devanne, “he can’t work the same trick twice.”\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n“I will show you.”\\n\\nHe rose, and pointing to a small empty space between the two enormous\\nfolios on one of the shelves of the bookcase, he said:\\n\\n“There used to be a book there--a book of the sixteenth century entitled\\n‘Chronique de Thibermesnil,’ which contained the history of the castle\\nsince its construction by Duke Rollo on the site of a former feudal\\nfortress. There were three engraved plates in the book; one of which was\\na general view of the whole estate; another, the plan of the buildings;\\nand the third--I call your attention to it, particularly--the third was\\nthe sketch of a subterranean passage, an entrance to which is outside\\nthe first line of ramparts, while the other end of the passage is here,\\nin this very room. Well, that book disappeared a month ago.”\\n\\n“The deuce!” said Velmont, “that looks bad. But it doesn’t seem to be a\\nsufficient reason for sending for Sherlock Holmes.”\\n\\n“Certainly, that was not sufficient in itself, but another incident\\nhappened that gives the disappearance of the book a special\\nsignificance. There was another copy of this book in the National\\nLibrary at Paris, and the two books differed in certain details relating\\nto the subterranean passage; for instance, each of them contained\\ndrawings and annotations, not printed, but written in ink and more or\\nless effaced. I knew those facts, and I knew that the exact location of\\nthe passage could be determined only by a comparison of the two books.\\nNow, the day after my book disappeared, the book was called for in the\\nNational Library by a reader who carried it away, and no one knows how\\nthe theft was effected.”\\n\\nThe guests uttered many exclamations of surprise.\\n\\n“Certainly, the affair looks serious,” said one.\\n\\n“Well, the police investigated the matter, and, as usual, discovered no\\nclue whatever.”\\n\\n“They never do, when Arsène Lupin is concerned in it.”\\n\\n“Exactly; and so I decided to ask the assistance of Sherlock Holmes,\\nwho replied that he was ready and anxious to enter the lists with Arsène\\nLupin.”\\n\\n“What glory for Arsène Lupin!” said Velmont. “But if our national thief,\\nas they call him, has no evil designs on your castle, Sherlock Holmes\\nwill have his trip in vain.”\\n\\n“There are other things that will interest him, such as the discovery of\\nthe subterranean passage.”\\n\\n“But you told us that one end of the passage was outside the ramparts\\nand the other was in this very room!”\\n\\n“Yes, but in what part of the room? The line which represents the\\npassage on the charts ends here, with a small circle marked with the\\nletters ‘T.G.,’ which no doubt stand for ‘Tour Guillaume.’ But the tower\\nis round, and who can tell the exact spot at which the passage touches\\nthe tower?”\\n\\nDevanne lighted a second cigar and poured himself a glass of\\nBenedictine. His guests pressed him with questions and he was pleased to\\nobserve the interest that his remarks had created. Then he continued:\\n\\n“The secret is lost. No one knows it. The legend is to the effect that\\nthe former lords of the castle transmitted the secret from father to son\\non their deathbeds, until Geoffroy, the last of the race, was beheaded\\nduring the Revolution in his nineteenth year.”\\n\\n“That is over a century ago. Surely, someone has looked for it since\\nthat time?”\\n\\n“Yes, but they failed to find it. After I purchased the castle, I made a\\ndiligent search for it, but without success. You must remember that this\\ntower is surrounded by water and connected with the castle only by a\\nbridge; consequently, the passage must be underneath the old moat. The\\nplan that was in the book in the National Library showed a series of\\nstairs with a total of forty-eight steps, which indicates a depth of\\nmore than ten meters. You see, the mystery lies within the walls of this\\nroom, and yet I dislike to tear them down.”\\n\\n“Is there nothing to show where it is?”\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\n“Mon. Devanne, we should turn our attention to the two quotations,”\\n suggested Father Gélis.\\n\\n“Oh!” exclaimed Mon. Devanne, laughing, “our worthy father is fond\\nof reading memoirs and delving into the musty archives of the castle.\\nEverything relating to Thibermesnil interests him greatly. But the\\nquotations that he mentions only serve to complicate the mystery. He\\nhas read somewhere that two kings of France have known the key to the\\npuzzle.”\\n\\n“Two kings of France! Who were they?”\\n\\n“Henry the Fourth and Louis the Sixteenth. And the legend runs like\\nthis: On the eve of the battle of Arques, Henry the Fourth spent the\\nnight in this castle. At eleven o’clock in the evening, Louise de\\nTancarville, the prettiest woman in Normandy, was brought into the\\ncastle through the subterranean passage by Duke Edgard, who, at the\\nsame time, informed the king of the secret passage. Afterward, the king\\nconfided the secret to his minister Sully, who, in turn, relates the\\nstory in his book, “Royales Economies d’Etat,” without making any\\ncomment upon it, but linking with it this incomprehensible sentence:\\n‘Turn one eye on the bee that shakes, the other eye will lead to God!’”\\n\\nAfter a brief silence, Velmont laughed and said:\\n\\n“Certainly, it doesn’t throw a dazzling light upon the subject.”\\n\\n“No; but Father Gélis claims that Sully concealed the key to the\\nmystery in this strange sentence in order to keep the secret from the\\nsecretaries to whom he dictated his memoirs.”\\n\\n“That is an ingenious theory,” said Velmont.\\n\\n“Yes, and it may be nothing more; I cannot see that it throws any light\\non the mysterious riddle.”\\n\\n“And was it also to receive the visit of a lady that Louis the Sixteenth\\ncaused the passage to be opened?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Mon. Devanne. “All I can say is that the king\\nstopped here one night in 1784, and that the famous Iron Casket found\\nin the Louvre contained a paper bearing these words in the king’s own\\nwriting: ‘Thibermesnil 3-4-11.’”\\n\\nHorace Velmont laughed heartily, and exclaimed:\\n\\n“At last! And now that we have the magic key, where is the man who can\\nfit it to the invisible lock?”\\n\\n“Laugh as much as you please, monsieur,” said Father Gélis, “but I am\\nconfident the solution is contained in those two sentences, and some day\\nwe will find a man able to interpret them.”\\n\\n“Sherlock Holmes is the man,” said Mon. Devanne, “unless Arsène Lupin\\ngets ahead of him. What is your opinion, Velmont?”\\n\\nVelmont arose, placed his hand on Devanne’s shoulder, and declared:\\n\\n“I think that the information furnished by your book and the book of the\\nNational Library was deficient in a very important detail which you have\\nnow supplied. I thank you for it.”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“The missing key. Now that I have it, I can go to work at once,” said\\nVelmont.\\n\\n“Of course; without losing a minute,” said Devanne, smiling.\\n\\n“Not even a second!” replied Velmont. “To-night, before the arrival of\\nSherlock Holmes, I must plunder your castle.”\\n\\n“You have no time to lose. Oh! by the way, I can drive you over this\\nevening.”\\n\\n“To Dieppe?”\\n\\n“Yes. I am going to meet Monsieur and Madame d’Androl and a young lady\\nof their acquaintance who are to arrive by the midnight train.”\\n\\nThen addressing the officers, Devanne added:\\n\\n“Gentlemen, I shall expect to see all of you at breakfast to-morrow.”\\n\\nThe invitation was accepted. The company dispersed, and a few moments\\nlater Devanne and Velmont were speeding toward Dieppe in an automobile.\\nDevanne dropped the artist in front of the Casino, and proceeded to the\\nrailway station. At twelve o’clock his friends alighted from the train.\\nA half hour later the automobile was at the entrance to the castle.\\nAt one o’clock, after a light supper, they retired. The lights were\\nextinguished, and the castle was enveloped in the darkness and silence\\nof the night.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nThe moon appeared through a rift in the clouds, and filled the\\ndrawing-room with its bright white light. But only for a moment. Then\\nthe moon again retired behind its ethereal draperies, and darkness and\\nsilence reigned supreme. No sound could be heard, save the monotonous\\nticking of the clock. It struck two, and then continued its endless\\nrepetitions of the seconds. Then, three o’clock.\\n\\nSuddenly, something clicked, like the opening and closing of a\\nsignal-disc that warns the passing train. A thin stream of light flashed\\nto every corner of the room, like an arrow that leaves behind it a\\ntrail of light. It shot forth from the central fluting of a column that\\nsupported the pediment of the bookcase. It rested for a moment on\\nthe panel opposite like a glittering circle of burnished silver, then\\nflashed in all directions like a guilty eye that scrutinizes every\\nshadow. It disappeared for a short time, but burst forth again as a\\nwhole section of the bookcase revolved on a pivot and disclosed a large\\nopening like a vault.\\n\\nA man entered, carrying an electric lantern. He was followed by a second\\nman, who carried a coil of rope and various tools. The leader inspected\\nthe room, listened a moment, and said:\\n\\n“Call the others.”\\n\\nThen eight men, stout fellows with resolute faces, entered the room,\\nand immediately commenced to remove the furnishings. Arsène Lupin passed\\nquickly from one piece of furniture to another, examined each, and,\\naccording to its size or artistic value, he directed his men to take it\\nor leave it. If ordered to be taken, it was carried to the gaping mouth\\nof the tunnel, and ruthlessly thrust into the bowels of the earth. Such\\nwas the fate of six armchairs, six small Louis XV chairs, a quantity\\nof Aubusson tapestries, some candelabra, paintings by Fragonard and\\nNattier, a bust by Houdon, and some statuettes. Sometimes, Lupin would\\nlinger before a beautiful chest or a superb picture, and sigh:\\n\\n“That is too heavy.... too large.... what a pity!”\\n\\nIn forty minutes the room was dismantled; and it had been accomplished\\nin such an orderly manner and with as little noise as if the various\\narticles had been packed and wadded for the occasion.\\n\\nLupin said to the last man who departed by way of the tunnel:\\n\\n“You need not come back. You understand, that as soon as the auto-van is\\nloaded, you are to proceed to the grange at Roquefort.”\\n\\n“But you, patron?”\\n\\n“Leave me the motor-cycle.”\\n\\nWhen the man had disappeared, Arsène Lupin pushed the section of the\\nbookcase back into its place, carefully effaced the traces of the men’s\\nfootsteps, raised a portière, and entered a gallery, which was the only\\nmeans of communication between the tower and the castle. In the center\\nof this gallery there was a glass cabinet which had attracted Lupin’s\\nattentions. It contained a valuable collection of watches, snuff-boxes,\\nrings, chatelaines and miniatures of rare and beautiful workmanship. He\\nforced the lock with a small jimmy, and experienced a great pleasure in\\nhandling those gold and silver ornaments, those exquisite and delicate\\nworks of art.\\n\\nHe carried a large linen bag, specially prepared for the removal of\\nsuch knick-knacks. He filled it. Then he filled the pockets of his coat,\\nwaistcoat and trousers. And he was just placing over his left arm a\\nnumber of pearl reticules when he heard a slight sound. He listened. No,\\nhe was not deceived. The noise continued. Then he remembered that, at\\none end of the gallery, there was a stairway leading to an unoccupied\\napartment, but which was probably occupied that night by the young lady\\nwhom Mon. Devanne had brought from Dieppe with his other visitors.\\n\\nImmediately he extinguished his lantern, and had scarcely gained the\\nfriendly shelter of a window-embrasure, when the door at the top of the\\nstairway was opened and a feeble light illuminated the gallery. He could\\nfeel--for, concealed by a curtain, he could not see--that a woman was\\ncautiously descending the upper steps of the stairs. He hoped she would\\ncome no closer. Yet, she continued to descend, and even advanced some\\ndistance into the room. Then she uttered a faint cry. No doubt she had\\ndiscovered the broken and dismantled cabinet.\\n\\nShe advanced again. Now he could smell the perfume, and hear the\\nthrobbing of her heart as she drew closer to the window where he was\\nconcealed. She passed so close that her skirt brushed against the\\nwindow-curtain, and Lupin felt that she suspected the presence of\\nanother, behind her, in the shadow, within reach of her hand. He\\nthought: “She is afraid. She will go away.” But she did not go. The\\ncandle, that she carried in her trembling hand, grew brighter. She\\nturned, hesitated a moment, appeared to listen, then suddenly drew aside\\nthe curtain.\\n\\nThey stood face to face. Arsène was astounded. He murmured,\\ninvoluntarily:\\n\\n“You--you--mademoiselle.”\\n\\nIt was Miss Nelly. Miss Nelly! his fellow passenger on the transatlantic\\nsteamer, who had been the subject of his dreams on that memorable\\nvoyage, who had been a witness to his arrest, and who, rather than\\nbetray him, had dropped into the water the Kodak in which he had\\nconcealed the bank-notes and diamonds. Miss Nelly! that charming\\ncreature, the memory of whose face had sometimes cheered, sometimes\\nsaddened the long hours of imprisonment.\\n\\nIt was such an unexpected encounter that brought them face to face in\\nthat castle at that hour of the night, that they could not move,\\nnor utter a word; they were amazed, hypnotized, each at the sudden\\napparition of the other. Trembling with emotion, Miss Nelly staggered to\\na seat. He remained standing in front of her.\\n\\nGradually, he realized the situation and conceived the impression he\\nmust have produced at that moment with his arms laden with knick-knacks,\\nand his pockets and a linen sack overflowing with plunder. He was\\novercome with confusion, and he actually blushed to find himself in\\nthe position of a thief caught in the act. To her, henceforth, he was\\na thief, a man who puts his hand in another’s pocket, who steals into\\nhouses and robs people while they sleep.\\n\\nA watch fell upon the floor; then another. These were followed by other\\narticles which slipped from his grasp one by one. Then, actuated by a\\nsudden decision, he dropped the other articles into an armchair, emptied\\nhis pockets and unpacked his sack. He felt very uncomfortable in Nelly’s\\npresence, and stepped toward her with the intention of speaking to her,\\nbut she shuddered, rose quickly and fled toward the salon. The portière\\nclosed behind her. He followed her. She was standing trembling and\\namazed at the sight of the devastated room. He said to her, at once:\\n\\n“To-morrow, at three o’clock, everything will be returned. The furniture\\nwill be brought back.”\\n\\nShe made no reply, so he repeated:\\n\\n“I promise it. To-morrow, at three o’clock. Nothing in the world could\\ninduce me to break that promise....To-morrow, at three o’clock.”\\n\\nThen followed a long silence that he dared not break, whilst the\\nagitation of the young girl caused him a feeling of genuine regret.\\nQuietly, without a word, he turned away, thinking: “I hope she will go\\naway. I can’t endure her presence.” But the young girl suddenly spoke,\\nand stammered:\\n\\n“Listen.... footsteps....I hear someone....”\\n\\nHe looked at her with astonishment. She seemed to be overwhelmed by the\\nthought of approaching peril.\\n\\n“I don’t hear anything,” he said.\\n\\n“But you must go--you must escape!”\\n\\n“Why should I go?”\\n\\n“Because--you must. Oh! do not remain here another minute. Go!”\\n\\nShe ran, quickly, to the door leading to the gallery and listened. No,\\nthere was no one there. Perhaps the noise was outside. She waited a\\nmoment, then returned reassured.\\n\\nBut Arsène Lupin had disappeared.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nAs soon as Mon. Devanne was informed of the pillage of his castle, he\\nsaid to himself: It was Velmont who did it, and Velmont is Arsène Lupin.\\nThat theory explained everything, and there was no other plausible\\nexplanation. And yet the idea seemed preposterous. It was ridiculous to\\nsuppose that Velmont was anyone else than Velmont, the famous artist,\\nand club-fellow of his cousin d’Estevan. So, when the captain of the\\ngendarmes arrived to investigate the affair, Devanne did not even think\\nof mentioning his absurd theory.\\n\\nThroughout the forenoon there was a lively commotion at the castle.\\nThe gendarmes, the local police, the chief of police from Dieppe, the\\nvillagers, all circulated to and fro in the halls, examining every\\nnook and corner that was open to their inspection. The approach of the\\nmaneuvering troops, the rattling fire of the musketry, added to the\\npicturesque character of the scene.\\n\\nThe preliminary search furnished no clue. Neither the doors nor windows\\nshowed any signs of having been disturbed. Consequently, the removal of\\nthe goods must have been effected by means of the secret passage. Yet,\\nthere were no indications of footsteps on the floor, nor any unusual\\nmarks upon the walls.\\n\\nTheir investigations revealed, however, one curious fact that denoted\\nthe whimsical character of Arsène Lupin: the famous Chronique of the\\nsixteenth century had been restored to its accustomed place in the\\nlibrary and, beside it, there was a similar book, which was none other\\nthan the volume stolen from the National Library.\\n\\nAt eleven o’clock the military officers arrived. Devanne welcomed them\\nwith his usual gayety; for, no matter how much chagrin he might suffer\\nfrom the loss of his artistic treasures, his great wealth enabled him to\\nbear his loss philosophically. His guests, Monsieur and Madame d’Androl\\nand Miss Nelly, were introduced; and it was then noticed that one of the\\nexpected guests had not arrived. It was Horace Velmont. Would he come?\\nHis absence had awakened the suspicions of Mon. Devanne. But at twelve\\no’clock he arrived. Devanne exclaimed:\\n\\n“Ah! here you are!”\\n\\n“Why, am I not punctual?” asked Velmont.\\n\\n“Yes, and I am surprised that you are.... after such a busy night! I\\nsuppose you know the news?”\\n\\n“What news?”\\n\\n“You have robbed the castle.”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed Velmont, smiling.\\n\\n“Exactly as I predicted. But, first escort Miss Underdown to the\\ndining-room. Mademoiselle, allow me--”\\n\\nHe stopped, as he remarked the extreme agitation of the young girl.\\nThen, recalling the incident, he said:\\n\\n“Ah! of course, you met Arsène Lupin on the steamer, before his arrest,\\nand you are astonished at the resemblance. Is that it?”\\n\\nShe did not reply. Velmont stood before her, smiling. He bowed. She\\ntook his proffered arm. He escorted her to her place, and took his seat\\nopposite her. During the breakfast, the conversation related exclusively\\nto Arsène Lupin, the stolen goods, the secret passage, and Sherlock\\nHolmes. It was only at the close of the repast, when the conversation\\nhad drifted to other subjects, that Velmont took any part in it. Then\\nhe was, by turns, amusing and grave, talkative and pensive. And all\\nhis remarks seemed to be directed to the young girl. But she, quite\\nabsorbed, did not appear to hear them.\\n\\nCoffee was served on the terrace overlooking the court of honor and\\nthe flower garden in front of the principal façade. The regimental band\\nplayed on the lawn, and scores of soldiers and peasants wandered through\\nthe park.\\n\\nMiss Nelly had not forgotten, for one moment, Lupin’s solemn promise:\\n“To-morrow, at three o’clock, everything will be returned.”\\n\\nAt three o’clock! And the hands of the great clock in the right wing of\\nthe castle now marked twenty minutes to three. In spite of herself, her\\neyes wandered to the clock every minute. She also watched Velmont, who\\nwas calmly swinging to and fro in a comfortable rocking chair.\\n\\nTen minutes to three!....Five minutes to three!....Nelly was impatient\\nand anxious. Was it possible that Arsène Lupin would carry out his\\npromise at the appointed hour, when the castle, the courtyard, and the\\npark were filled with people, and at the very moment when the officers\\nof the law were pursuing their investigations? And yet....Arsène Lupin\\nhad given her his solemn promise. “It will be exactly as he said,”\\n thought she, so deeply was she impressed with the authority, energy and\\nassurance of that remarkable man. To her, it no longer assumed the form\\nof a miracle, but, on the contrary, a natural incident that must occur\\nin the ordinary course of events. She blushed, and turned her head.\\n\\nThree o’clock! The great clock struck slowly:\\none.... two.... three....Horace Velmont took out his watch, glanced at the\\nclock, then returned the watch to his pocket. A few seconds passed in\\nsilence; and then the crowd in the courtyard parted to give passage\\nto two wagons, that had just entered the park-gate, each drawn by two\\nhorses. They were army-wagons, such as are used for the transportation\\nof provisions, tents, and other necessary military stores. They stopped\\nin front of the main entrance, and a commissary-sergeant leaped from\\none of the wagons and inquired for Mon. Devanne. A moment later, that\\ngentleman emerged from the house, descended the steps, and, under\\nthe canvas covers of the wagons, beheld his furniture, pictures and\\nornaments carefully packaged and arranged.\\n\\nWhen questioned, the sergeant produced an order that he had received\\nfrom the officer of the day. By that order, the second company of the\\nfourth battalion were commanded to proceed to the crossroads of Halleux\\nin the forest of Arques, gather up the furniture and other articles\\ndeposited there, and deliver same to Monsieur Georges Devanne, owner of\\nthe Thibermesnil castle, at three o’clock. Signed: Col. Beauvel.\\n\\n“At the crossroads,” explained the sergeant, “we found everything ready,\\nlying on the grass, guarded by some passers-by. It seemed very strange,\\nbut the order was imperative.”\\n\\nOne of the officers examined the signature. He declared it a forgery;\\nbut a clever imitation. The wagons were unloaded, and the goods restored\\nto their proper places in the castle.\\n\\nDuring this commotion, Nelly had remained alone at the extreme end of\\nthe terrace, absorbed by confused and distracted thoughts. Suddenly, she\\nobserved Velmont approaching her. She would have avoided him, but the\\nbalustrade that surrounded the terrace cut off her retreat. She was\\ncornered. She could not move. A gleam of sunshine, passing through the\\nscant foliage of a bamboo, lighted up her beautiful golden hair. Some\\none spoke to her in a low voice:\\n\\n“Have I not kept my promise?”\\n\\nArsène Lupin stood close to her. No one else was near. He repeated, in a\\ncalm, soft voice:\\n\\n“Have I not kept my promise?”\\n\\nHe expected a word of thanks, or at least some slight movement that\\nwould betray her interest in the fulfillment of his promise. But she\\nremained silent.\\n\\nHer scornful attitude annoyed Arsène Lupin; and he realized the vast\\ndistance that separated him from Miss Nelly, now that she had learned\\nthe truth. He would gladly have justified himself in her eyes, or at\\nleast pleaded extenuating circumstances, but he perceived the absurdity\\nand futility of such an attempt. Finally, dominated by a surging flood\\nof memories, he murmured:\\n\\n“Ah! how long ago that was! You remember the long hours on the deck of\\nthe ‘Provence.’ Then, you carried a rose in your hand, a white rose like\\nthe one you carry to-day. I asked you for it. You pretended you did\\nnot hear me. After you had gone away, I found the rose--forgotten, no\\ndoubt--and I kept it.”\\n\\nShe made no reply. She seemed to be far away. He continued:\\n\\n“In memory of those happy hours, forget what you have learned since.\\nSeparate the past from the present. Do not regard me as the man you saw\\nlast night, but look at me, if only for a moment, as you did in those\\nfar-off days when I was Bernard d’Andrezy, for a short time. Will you,\\nplease?”\\n\\nShe raised her eyes and looked at him as he had requested. Then, without\\nsaying a word, she pointed to a ring he was wearing on his forefinger.\\nOnly the ring was visible; but the setting, which was turned toward the\\npalm of his hand, consisted of a magnificent ruby. Arsène Lupin blushed.\\nThe ring belonged to Georges Devanne. He smiled bitterly, and said:\\n\\n“You are right. Nothing can be changed. Arsène Lupin is now and always\\nwill be Arsène Lupin. To you, he cannot be even so much as a memory.\\nPardon me....I should have known that any attention I may now offer you\\nis simply an insult. Forgive me.”\\n\\nHe stepped aside, hat in hand. Nelly passed before him. He was inclined\\nto detain her and beseech her forgiveness. But his courage failed, and\\nhe contented himself by following her with his eyes, as he had done when\\nshe descended the gangway to the pier at New York. She mounted the steps\\nleading to the door, and disappeared within the house. He saw her no\\nmore.\\n\\nA cloud obscured the sun. Arsène Lupin stood watching the imprints of\\nher tiny feet in the sand. Suddenly, he gave a start. Upon the box which\\ncontained the bamboo, beside which Nelly had been standing, he saw\\nthe rose, the white rose which he had desired but dared not ask\\nfor. Forgotten, no doubt--it, also! But how--designedly or through\\ndistraction? He seized it eagerly. Some of its petals fell to the\\nground. He picked them up, one by one, like precious relics.\\n\\n“Come!” he said to himself, “I have nothing more to do here. I must\\nthink of my safety, before Sherlock Holmes arrives.”\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nThe park was deserted, but some gendarmes were stationed at the\\npark-gate. He entered a grove of pine trees, leaped over the wall,\\nand, as a short cut to the railroad station, followed a path across the\\nfields. After walking about ten minutes, he arrived at a spot where the\\nroad grew narrower and ran between two steep banks. In this ravine, he\\nmet a man traveling in the opposite direction. It was a man about fifty\\nyears of age, tall, smooth-shaven, and wearing clothes of a foreign cut.\\nHe carried a heavy cane, and a small satchel was strapped across his\\nshoulder. When they met, the stranger spoke, with a slight English\\naccent:\\n\\n“Excuse me, monsieur, is this the way to the castle?”\\n\\n“Yes, monsieur, straight ahead, and turn to the left when you come to\\nthe wall. They are expecting you.”\\n\\n“Ah!”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend Devanne told us last night that you were coming, and I\\nam delighted to be the first to welcome you. Sherlock Holmes has no more\\nardent admirer than.... myself.”\\n\\nThere was a touch of irony in his voice that he quickly regretted, for\\nSherlock Holmes scrutinized him from head to foot with such a keen,\\npenetrating eye that Arsène Lupin experienced the sensation of being\\nseized, imprisoned and registered by that look more thoroughly and\\nprecisely than he had ever been by a camera.\\n\\n“My negative is taken now,” he thought, “and it will be useless to use\\na disguise with that man. He would look right through it. But, I wonder,\\nhas he recognized me?”\\n\\nThey bowed to each other as if about to part. But, at that moment, they\\nheard a sound of horses’ feet, accompanied by a clinking of steel. It\\nwas the gendarmes. The two men were obliged to draw back against the\\nembankment, amongst the brushes, to avoid the horses. The gendarmes\\npassed by, but, as they followed each other at a considerable distance,\\nthey were several minutes in doing so. And Lupin was thinking:\\n\\n“It all depends on that question: has he recognized me? If so, he will\\nprobably take advantage of the opportunity. It is a trying situation.”\\n\\nWhen the last horseman had passed, Sherlock Holmes stepped forth and\\nbrushed the dust from his clothes. Then, for a moment, he and Arsène\\nLupin gazed at each other; and, if a person could have seen them at that\\nmoment, it would have been an interesting sight, and memorable as the\\nfirst meeting of two remarkable men, so strange, so powerfully equipped,\\nboth of superior quality, and destined by fate, through their peculiar\\nattributes, to hurl themselves one at the other like two equal forces\\nthat nature opposes, one against the other, in the realms of space.\\n\\nThen the Englishman said: “Thank you, monsieur.”\\n\\n“You are quite welcome,” replied Arsène Lupin.\\n\\nThey parted. Lupin went toward the railway station, and Sherlock Holmes\\ncontinued on his way to the castle.\\n\\nThe local officers had given up the investigation after several hours\\nof fruitless efforts, and the people at the castle were awaiting the\\narrival of the English detective with a lively curiosity. At first\\nsight, they were a little disappointed on account of his commonplace\\nappearance, which differed so greatly from the pictures they had formed\\nof him in their own minds. He did not in any way resemble the romantic\\nhero, the mysterious and diabolical personage that the name of Sherlock\\nHolmes had evoked in their imaginations. However, Mon. Devanne exclaimed\\nwith much gusto:\\n\\n“Ah! monsieur, you are here! I am delighted to see you. It is a\\nlong-deferred pleasure. Really, I scarcely regret what has happened,\\nsince it affords me the opportunity to meet you. But, how did you come?”\\n\\n“By the train.”\\n\\n“But I sent my automobile to meet you at the station.”\\n\\n“An official reception, eh? with music and fireworks! Oh! no, not for\\nme. That is not the way I do business,” grumbled the Englishman.\\n\\nThis speech disconcerted Devanne, who replied, with a forced smile:\\n\\n“Fortunately, the business has been greatly simplified since I wrote to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“In what way?”\\n\\n“The robbery took place last night.”\\n\\n“If you had not announced my intended visit, it is probable the robbery\\nwould not have been committed last night.”\\n\\n“When, then?”\\n\\n“To-morrow, or some other day.”\\n\\n“And in that case?”\\n\\n“Lupin would have been trapped,” said the detective.\\n\\n“And my furniture?”\\n\\n“Would not have been carried away.”\\n\\n“Ah! but my goods are here. They were brought back at three o’clock.”\\n\\n“By Lupin.”\\n\\n“By two army-wagons.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes put on his cap and adjusted his satchel. Devanne\\nexclaimed, anxiously:\\n\\n“But, monsieur, what are you going to do?”\\n\\n“I am going home.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Your goods have been returned; Arsène Lupin is far away--there is\\nnothing for me to do.”\\n\\n“Yes, there is. I need your assistance. What happened yesterday, may\\nhappen again to-morrow, as we do not know how he entered, or how he\\nescaped, or why, a few hours later, he returned the goods.”\\n\\n“Ah! you don’t know--”\\n\\nThe idea of a problem to be solved quickened the interest of Sherlock\\nHolmes.\\n\\n“Very well, let us make a search--at once--and alone, if possible.”\\n\\nDevanne understood, and conducted the Englishman to the salon. In a dry,\\ncrisp voice, in sentences that seemed to have been prepared in advance,\\nHolmes asked a number of questions about the events of the preceding\\nevening, and enquired also concerning the guests and the members of the\\nhousehold. Then he examined the two volumes of the “Chronique,” compared\\nthe plans of the subterranean passage, requested a repetition of the\\nsentences discovered by Father Gélis, and then asked:\\n\\n“Was yesterday the first time you have spoken those two sentences to any\\none?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“You had never communicated then to Horace Velmont?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Well, order the automobile. I must leave in an hour.”\\n\\n“In an hour?”\\n\\n“Yes; within that time, Arsène Lupin solved the problem that you placed\\nbefore him.”\\n\\n“I.... placed before him--”\\n\\n“Yes, Arsène Lupin or Horace Velmont--same thing.”\\n\\n“I thought so. Ah! the scoundrel!”\\n\\n“Now, let us see,” said Holmes, “last night at ten o’clock, you\\nfurnished Lupin with the information that he lacked, and that he had\\nbeen seeking for many weeks. During the night, he found time to solve\\nthe problem, collect his men, and rob the castle. I shall be quite as\\nexpeditious.”\\n\\nHe walked from end to end of the room, in deep thought, then sat down,\\ncrossed his long legs and closed his eyes.\\n\\nDevanne waited, quite embarrassed. Thought he: “Is the man asleep? Or is\\nhe only meditating?” However, he left the room to give some orders, and\\nwhen he returned he found the detective on his knees scrutinizing the\\ncarpet at the foot of the stairs in the gallery.\\n\\n“What is it?” he enquired.\\n\\n“Look.... there.... spots from a candle.”\\n\\n“You are right--and quite fresh.”\\n\\n“And you will also find them at the top of the stairs, and around\\nthe cabinet that Arsène Lupin broke into, and from which he took the\\nbibelots that he afterward placed in this armchair.”\\n\\n“What do you conclude from that?”\\n\\n“Nothing. These facts would doubtless explain the cause for the\\nrestitution, but that is a side issue that I cannot wait to investigate.\\nThe main question is the secret passage. First, tell me, is there a\\nchapel some two or three hundred metres from the castle?”\\n\\n“Yes, a ruined chapel, containing the tomb of Duke Rollo.”\\n\\n“Tell your chauffer to wait for us near that chapel.”\\n\\n“My chauffer hasn’t returned. If he had, they would have informed me. Do\\nyou think the secret passage runs to the chapel? What reason have--”\\n\\n“I would ask you, monsieur,” interrupted the detective, “to furnish me\\nwith a ladder and a lantern.”\\n\\n“What! do you require a ladder and a lantern?”\\n\\n“Certainly, or I shouldn’t have asked for them.”\\n\\nDevanne, somewhat disconcerted by this crude logic, rang the bell. The\\ntwo articles were given with the sternness and precision of military\\ncommands.\\n\\n“Place the ladder against the bookcase, to the left of the word\\nThibermesnil.”\\n\\nDevanne placed the ladder as directed, and the Englishman continued:\\n\\n“More to the left.... to the right....There!....Now, climb up.... All the\\nletters are in relief, aren’t they?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“First, turn the letter I one way or the other.”\\n\\n“Which one? There are two of them.”\\n\\n“The first one.”\\n\\nDevanne took hold of the letter, and exclaimed:\\n\\n“Ah! yes, it turns toward the right. Who told you that?”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes did not reply to the question, but continued his\\ndirections:\\n\\n“Now, take the letter B. Move it back and forth as you would a bolt.”\\n\\nDevanne did so, and, to his great surprise, it produced a clicking\\nsound.\\n\\n“Quite right,” said Holmes. “Now, we will go to the other end of the\\nword Thibermesnil, try the letter I, and see if it will open like a\\nwicket.”\\n\\nWith a certain degree of solemnity, Devanne seized the letter. It\\nopened, but Devanne fell from the ladder, for the entire section of the\\nbookcase, lying between the first and last letters of the words, turned\\non a pivot and disclosed the subterranean passage.\\n\\nSherlock Holmes said, coolly:\\n\\n“You are not hurt?”\\n\\n“No, no,” said Devanne, as he rose to his feet, “not hurt, only\\nbewildered. I can’t understand now.... those letters turn.... the secret\\npassage opens....”\\n\\n“Certainly. Doesn’t that agree exactly with the formula given by Sully?\\nTurn one eye on the bee that shakes, the other eye will lead to God.”\\n\\n“But Louis the sixteenth?” asked Devanne.\\n\\n“Louis the sixteenth was a clever locksmith. I have read a book he wrote\\nabout combination locks. It was a good idea on the part of the owner of\\nThibermesnil to show His Majesty a clever bit of mechanism. As an aid\\nto his memory, the king wrote: 3-4-11, that is to say, the third, fourth\\nand eleventh letters of the word.”\\n\\n“Exactly. I understand that. It explains how Lupin got out of the room,\\nbut it does not explain how he entered. And it is certain he came from\\nthe outside.”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes lighted his lantern, and stepped into the passage.\\n\\n“Look! All the mechanism is exposed here, like the works of a clock,\\nand the reverse side of the letters can be reached. Lupin worked the\\ncombination from this side--that is all.”\\n\\n“What proof is there of that?”\\n\\n“Proof? Why, look at that puddle of oil. Lupin foresaw that the wheels\\nwould require oiling.”\\n\\n“Did he know about the other entrance?”\\n\\n“As well as I know it,” said Holmes. “Follow me.”\\n\\n“Into that dark passage?”\\n\\n“Are you afraid?”\\n\\n“No, but are you sure you can find the way out?”\\n\\n“With my eyes closed.”\\n\\nAt first, they descended twelve steps, then twelve more, and, farther\\non, two other flights of twelve steps each. Then they walked through a\\nlong passageway, the brick walls of which showed the marks of successive\\nrestorations, and, in spots, were dripping with water. The earth, also,\\nwas very damp.\\n\\n“We are passing under the pond,” said Devanne, somewhat nervously.\\n\\nAt last, they came to a stairway of twelve steps, followed by three\\nothers of twelve steps each, which they mounted with difficulty, and\\nthen found themselves in a small cavity cut in the rock. They could go\\nno further.\\n\\n“The deuce!” muttered Holmes, “nothing but bare walls. This is\\nprovoking.”\\n\\n“Let us go back,” said Devanne. “I have seen enough to satisfy me.”\\n\\nBut the Englishman raised his eye and uttered a sigh of relief. There,\\nhe saw the same mechanism and the same word as before. He had merely to\\nwork the three letters. He did so, and a block of granite swung out of\\nplace. On the other side, this granite block formed the tombstone of\\nDuke Rollo, and the word “Thibermesnil” was engraved on it in relief.\\nNow, they were in the little ruined chapel, and the detective said:\\n\\n“The other eye leads to God; that means, to the chapel.”\\n\\n“It is marvelous!” exclaimed Devanne, amazed at the clairvoyance and\\nvivacity of the Englishman. “Can it be possible that those few words\\nwere sufficient for you?”\\n\\n“Bah!” declared Holmes, “they weren’t even necessary. In the chart in\\nthe book of the National Library, the drawing terminates at the left, as\\nyou know, in a circle, and at the right, as you do not know, in a cross.\\nNow, that cross must refer to the chapel in which we now stand.”\\n\\nPoor Devanne could not believe his ears. It was all so new, so novel to\\nhim. He exclaimed:\\n\\n“It is incredible, miraculous, and yet of a childish simplicity! How is\\nit that no one has ever solved the mystery?”\\n\\n“Because no one has ever united the essential elements, that is to\\nsay, the two books and the two sentences. No one, but Arsène Lupin and\\nmyself.”\\n\\n“But, Father Gélis and I knew all about those things, and, likewise--”\\n\\nHolmes smiled, and said:\\n\\n“Monsieur Devanne, everybody cannot solve riddles.”\\n\\n“I have been trying for ten years to accomplish what you did in ten\\nminutes.”\\n\\n“Bah! I am used to it.”\\n\\nThey emerged from the chapel, and found an automobile.\\n\\n“Ah! there’s an auto waiting for us.”\\n\\n“Yes, it is mine,” said Devanne.\\n\\n“Yours? You said your chauffeur hadn’t returned.”\\n\\nThey approached the machine, and Mon. Devanne questioned the chauffer:\\n\\n“Edouard, who gave you orders to come here?”\\n\\n“Why, it was Monsieur Velmont.”\\n\\n“Mon. Velmont? Did you meet him?”\\n\\n“Near the railway station, and he told me to come to the chapel.”\\n\\n“To come to the chapel! What for?”\\n\\n“To wait for you, monsieur, and your friend.”\\n\\nDevanne and Holmes exchanged looks, and Mon. Devanne said:\\n\\n“He knew the mystery would be a simple one for you. It is a delicate\\ncompliment.”\\n\\nA smile of satisfaction lighted up the detective’s serious features for\\na moment. The compliment pleased him. He shook his head, as he said:\\n\\n“A clever man! I knew that when I saw him.”\\n\\n“Have you seen him?”\\n\\n“I met him a short time ago--on my way from the station.”\\n\\n“And you knew it was Horace Velmont--I mean, Arsène Lupin?”\\n\\n“That is right. I wonder how it came--”\\n\\n“No, but I supposed it was--from a certain ironical speech he made.”\\n\\n“And you allowed him to escape?”\\n\\n“Of course I did. And yet I had everything on my side, such as five\\ngendarmes who passed us.”\\n\\n“Sacrableu!” cried Devanne. “You should have taken advantage of the\\nopportunity.”\\n\\n“Really, monsieur,” said the Englishman, haughtily, “when I encounter\\nan adversary like Arsène Lupin, I do not take advantage of chance\\nopportunities, I create them.”\\n\\nBut time pressed, and since Lupin had been so kind as to send the\\nautomobile, they resolved to profit by it. They seated themselves in\\nthe comfortable limousine; Edouard took his place at the wheel, and away\\nthey went toward the railway station. Suddenly, Devanne’s eyes fell upon\\na small package in one of the pockets of the carriage.\\n\\n“Ah! what is that? A package! Whose is it? Why, it is for you.”\\n\\n“For me?”\\n\\n“Yes, it is addressed: Sherlock Holmes, from Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\nThe Englishman took the package, opened it, and found that it contained\\na watch.\\n\\n“Ah!” he exclaimed, with an angry gesture.\\n\\n“A watch,” said Devanne. “How did it come there?”\\n\\nThe detective did not reply.\\n\\n“Oh! it is your watch! Arsène Lupin returns your watch! But, in order to\\nreturn it, he must have taken it. Ah! I see! He took your watch! That\\nis a good one! Sherlock Holmes’ watch stolen by Arsène Lupin! Mon Dieu!\\nthat is funny! Really.... you must excuse me....I can’t help it.”\\n\\nHe roared with laughter, unable to control himself. After which, he\\nsaid, in a tone of earnest conviction:\\n\\n“A clever man, indeed!”\\n\\nThe Englishman never moved a muscle. On the way to Dieppe, he never\\nspoke a word, but fixed his gaze on the flying landscape. His silence\\nwas terrible, unfathomable, more violent than the wildest rage. At the\\nrailway station, he spoke calmly, but in a voice that impressed one with\\nthe vast energy and will power of that famous man. He said:\\n\\n“Yes, he is a clever man, but some day I shall have the pleasure of\\nplacing on his shoulder the hand I now offer to you, Monsieur Devanne.\\nAnd I believe that Arsène Lupin and Sherlock Holmes will meet again\\nsome day. Yes, the world is too small--we will meet--we must meet--and\\nthen--”\\n\\n                      *****\\n\\n--The further startling and thrilling adventures of Arsène Lupin will be\\nfound in the book entitled “Arsène Lupin versus Herlock Sholmes.”--\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ARSÈNE LUPIN, GENTLEMAN-BURGLAR ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

The golden light warmed the panelled walls and old\\nfurniture to a dull lustre, and gave back to the fading gilt of the\\nFirst Empire chairs and couches something of its old brightness. It\\nillumined the long line of pictures on the walls, pictures of dead and\\ngone Charmeraces, the stern or debonair faces of the men, soldiers,\\nstatesmen, dandies, the gentle or imperious faces of beautiful women.\\nIt flashed back from armour of brightly polished steel, and drew dull\\ngleams from armour of bronze. The hues of rare porcelain, of the rich\\ninlays of Oriental or Renaissance cabinets, mingled with the hues of\\nthe pictures, the tapestry, the Persian rugs about the polished floor\\nto fill the hall with a rich glow of colour.\\n\\nBut of all the beautiful and precious things which the sun-rays warmed\\nto a clearer beauty, the face of the girl who sat writing at a table in\\nfront of the long windows, which opened on to the centuries-old turf of\\nthe broad terrace, was the most beautiful and the most precious.\\n\\nIt was a delicate, almost frail, beauty. Her skin was clear with the\\ntransparent lustre of old porcelain, and her pale cheeks were only\\ntinted with the pink of the faintest roses. Her straight nose was\\ndelicately cut, her rounded chin admirably moulded. A lover of beauty\\nwould have been at a loss whether more to admire her clear, germander\\neyes, so melting and so adorable, or the sensitive mouth, with its\\nrather full lips, inviting all the kisses. But assuredly he would have\\nbeen grieved by the perpetual air of sadness which rested on the\\nbeautiful face—the wistful melancholy of the Slav, deepened by\\nsomething of personal misfortune and suffering.\\n\\nHer face was framed by a mass of soft fair hair, shot with strands of\\ngold where the sunlight fell on it; and little curls, rebellious to the\\ncomb, strayed over her white forehead, tiny feathers of gold.\\n\\nShe was addressing envelopes, and a long list of names lay on her left\\nhand. When she had addressed an envelope, she slipped into it a\\nwedding-card. On each was printed:\\n\\n“M. Gournay-Martin has the honour to inform\\nyou of the marriage of his daughter\\nGermaine to the Duke of Charmerace.”\\n\\n\\nShe wrote steadily on, adding envelope after envelope to the pile ready\\nfor the post, which rose in front of her. But now and again, when the\\nflushed and laughing girls who were playing lawn-tennis on the terrace,\\nraised their voices higher than usual as they called the score, and\\ndistracted her attention from her work, her gaze strayed through the\\nopen window and lingered on them wistfully; and as her eyes came back\\nto her task she sighed with so faint a wistfulness that she hardly knew\\nshe sighed. Then a voice from the terrace cried, “Sonia! Sonia!”\\n\\n“Yes. Mlle. Germaine?” answered the writing girl.\\n\\n“Tea! Order tea, will you?” cried the voice, a petulant voice, rather\\nharsh to the ear.\\n\\n“Very well, Mlle. Germaine,” said Sonia; and having finished addressing\\nthe envelope under her pen, she laid it on the pile ready to be posted,\\nand, crossing the room to the old, wide fireplace, she rang the bell.\\n\\nShe stood by the fireplace a moment, restoring to its place a rose\\nwhich had fallen from a vase on the mantelpiece; and her attitude, as\\nwith arms upraised she arranged the flowers, displayed the delightful\\nline of a slender figure. As she let fall her arms to her side, a\\nfootman entered the room.\\n\\n“Will you please bring the tea, Alfred,” she said in a charming voice\\nof that pure, bell-like tone which has been Nature’s most precious gift\\nto but a few of the greatest actresses.\\n\\n“For how many, miss?” said Alfred.\\n\\n“For four—unless your master has come back.”\\n\\n“Oh, no; he’s not back yet, miss. He went in the car to Rennes to\\nlunch; and it’s a good many miles away. He won’t be back for another\\nhour.”\\n\\n“And the Duke—he’s not back from his ride yet, is he?”\\n\\n“Not yet, miss,” said Alfred, turning to go.\\n\\n“One moment,” said Sonia. “Have all of you got your things packed for\\nthe journey to Paris? You will have to start soon, you know. Are all\\nthe maids ready?”\\n\\n“Well, all the men are ready, I know, miss. But about the maids, miss,\\nI can’t say. They’ve been bustling about all day; but it takes them\\nlonger than it does us.”\\n\\n“Tell them to hurry up; and be as quick as you can with the tea,\\nplease,” said Sonia.\\n\\nAlfred went out of the room; Sonia went back to the writing-table. She\\ndid not take up her pen; she took up one of the wedding-cards; and her\\nlips moved slowly as she read it in a pondering depression.\\n\\nThe petulant, imperious voice broke in upon her musing.\\n\\n“Whatever are you doing, Sonia? Aren’t you getting on with those\\nletters?” it cried angrily; and Germaine Gournay-Martin came through\\nthe long window into the hall.\\n\\nThe heiress to the Gournay-Martin millions carried her tennis racquet\\nin her hand; and her rosy cheeks were flushed redder than ever by the\\ngame. She was a pretty girl in a striking, high-coloured, rather\\nobvious way—the very foil to Sonia’s delicate beauty. Her lips were a\\nlittle too thin, her eyes too shallow; and together they gave her a\\nrather hard air, in strongest contrast to the gentle, sympathetic face\\nof Sonia.\\n\\nThe two friends with whom Germaine had been playing tennis followed her\\ninto the hall: Jeanne Gautier, tall, sallow, dark, with a somewhat\\nmalicious air; Marie Bullier, short, round, commonplace, and\\nsentimental.\\n\\nThey came to the table at which Sonia was at work; and pointing to the\\npile of envelopes, Marie said, “Are these all wedding-cards?”\\n\\n“Yes; and we’ve only got to the letter V,” said Germaine, frowning at\\nSonia.\\n\\n“Princesse de Vernan—Duchesse de Vauvieuse—Marquess—Marchioness? You’ve\\ninvited the whole Faubourg Saint-Germain,” said Marie, shuffling the\\npile of envelopes with an envious air.\\n\\n“You’ll know very few people at your wedding,” said Jeanne, with a\\nspiteful little giggle.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, my dear,” said Germaine boastfully. “Madame de\\nRelzières, my fiance’s cousin, gave an At Home the other day in my\\nhonour. At it she introduced half Paris to me—the Paris I’m destined to\\nknow, the Paris you’ll see in my drawing-rooms.”\\n\\n“But we shall no longer be fit friends for you when you’re the Duchess\\nof Charmerace,” said Jeanne.\\n\\n“Why?” said Germaine; and then she added quickly, “Above everything,\\nSonia, don’t forget Veauléglise, 33, University Street—33, University\\nStreet.”\\n\\n“Veauléglise—33, University Street,” said Sonia, taking a fresh\\nenvelope, and beginning to address it.\\n\\n“Wait—wait! don’t close the envelope. I’m wondering whether Veauléglise\\nought to have a cross, a double cross, or a triple cross,” said\\nGermaine, with an air of extreme importance.\\n\\n“What’s that?” cried Marie and Jeanne together.\\n\\n“A single cross means an invitation to the church, a double cross an\\ninvitation to the marriage and the wedding-breakfast, and the triple\\ncross means an invitation to the marriage, the breakfast, and the\\nsigning of the marriage-contract. What do you think the Duchess of\\nVeauléglise ought to have?”\\n\\n“Don’t ask me. I haven’t the honour of knowing that great lady,” cried\\nJeanne.\\n\\n“Nor I,” said Marie.\\n\\n“Nor I,” said Germaine. “But I have here the visiting-list of the late\\nDuchess of Charmerace, Jacques’ mother. The two duchesses were on\\nexcellent terms. Besides the Duchess of Veauléglise is rather worn-out,\\nbut greatly admired for her piety. She goes to early service three\\ntimes a week.”\\n\\n“Then put three crosses,” said Jeanne.\\n\\n“I shouldn’t,” said Marie quickly. “In your place, my dear, I shouldn’t\\nrisk a slip. I should ask my fiance’s advice. He knows this world.”\\n\\n“Oh, goodness—my fiance! He doesn’t care a rap about this kind of\\nthing. He has changed so in the last seven years. Seven years ago he\\ntook nothing seriously. Why, he set off on an expedition to the South\\nPole—just to show off. Oh, in those days he was truly a duke.”\\n\\n“And to-day?” said Jeanne.\\n\\n“Oh, to-day he’s a regular slow-coach. Society gets on his nerves. He’s\\nas sober as a judge,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“He’s as gay as a lark,” said Sonia, in sudden protest.\\n\\nGermaine pouted at her, and said: “Oh, he’s gay enough when he’s making\\nfun of people. But apart from that he’s as sober as a judge.”\\n\\n“Your father must be delighted with the change,” said Jeanne.\\n\\n“Naturally he’s delighted. Why, he’s lunching at Rennes to-day with the\\nMinister, with the sole object of getting Jacques decorated.”\\n\\n“Well; the Legion of Honour is a fine thing to have,” said Marie.\\n\\n“My dear! The Legion of Honour is all very well for middle-class\\npeople, but it’s quite out of place for a duke!” cried Germaine.\\n\\nAlfred came in, bearing the tea-tray, and set it on a little table near\\nthat at which Sonia was sitting.\\n\\nGermaine, who was feeling too important to sit still, was walking up\\nand down the room. Suddenly she stopped short, and pointing to a silver\\nstatuette which stood on the piano, she said, “What’s this? Why is this\\nstatuette here?”\\n\\n“Why, when we came in, it was on the cabinet, in its usual place,” said\\nSonia in some astonishment.\\n\\n“Did you come into the hall while we were out in the garden, Alfred?”\\nsaid Germaine to the footman.\\n\\n“No, miss,” said Alfred.\\n\\n“But some one must have come into it,” Germaine persisted.\\n\\n“I’ve not heard any one. I was in my pantry,” said Alfred.\\n\\n“It’s very odd,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“It is odd,” said Sonia. “Statuettes don’t move about of themselves.”\\n\\nAll of them stared at the statuette as if they expected it to move\\nagain forthwith, under their very eyes. Then Alfred put it back in its\\nusual place on one of the cabinets, and went out of the room.\\n\\nSonia poured out the tea; and over it they babbled about the coming\\nmarriage, the frocks they would wear at it, and the presents Germaine\\nhad already received. That reminded her to ask Sonia if any one had yet\\ntelephoned from her father’s house in Paris; and Sonia said that no one\\nhad.\\n\\n“That’s very annoying,” said Germaine. “It shows that nobody has sent\\nme a present to-day.”\\n\\nPouting, she shrugged her shoulders with an air of a spoiled child,\\nwhich sat but poorly on a well-developed young woman of twenty-three.\\n\\n“It’s Sunday. The shops don’t deliver things on Sunday,” said Sonia\\ngently.\\n\\nBut Germaine still pouted like a spoiled child.\\n\\n“Isn’t your beautiful Duke coming to have tea with us?” said Jeanne a\\nlittle anxiously.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; I’m expecting him at half-past four. He had to go for a ride\\nwith the two Du Buits. They’re coming to tea here, too,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Gone for a ride with the two Du Buits? But when?” cried Marie quickly.\\n\\n“This afternoon.”\\n\\n“He can’t be,” said Marie. “My brother went to the Du Buits’ house\\nafter lunch, to see Andre and Georges. They went for a drive this\\nmorning, and won’t be back till late to-night.”\\n\\n“Well, but—but why did the Duke tell me so?” said Germaine, knitting\\nher brow with a puzzled air.\\n\\n“If I were you, I should inquire into this thoroughly. Dukes—well, we\\nknow what dukes are—it will be just as well to keep an eye on him,”\\nsaid Jeanne maliciously.\\n\\nGermaine flushed quickly; and her eyes flashed. “Thank you. I have\\nevery confidence in Jacques. I am absolutely sure of him,” she said\\nangrily.\\n\\n“Oh, well—if you’re sure, it’s all right,” said Jeanne.\\n\\nThe ringing of the telephone-bell made a fortunate diversion.\\n\\nGermaine rushed to it, clapped the receiver to her ear, and cried:\\n“Hello, is that you, Pierre? ... Oh, it’s Victoire, is it? ... Ah, some\\npresents have come, have they? ... Well, well, what are they? ... What!\\na paper-knife—another paper-knife! ... Another Louis XVI. inkstand—oh,\\nbother! ... Who are they from? ... Oh, from the Countess Rudolph and\\nthe Baron de Valery.” Her voice rose high, thrilling with pride.\\n\\nThen she turned her face to her friends, with the receiver still at her\\near, and cried: “Oh, girls, a pearl necklace too! A large one! The\\npearls are big ones!”\\n\\n“How jolly!” said Marie.\\n\\n“Who sent it?” said Germaine, turning to the telephone again. “Oh, a\\nfriend of papa’s,” she added in a tone of disappointment. “Never mind,\\nafter all it’s a pearl necklace. You’ll be sure and lock the doors\\ncarefully, Victoire, won’t you? And lock up the necklace in the secret\\ncupboard.... Yes; thanks very much, Victoire. I shall see you\\nto-morrow.”\\n\\nShe hung up the receiver, and came away from the telephone frowning.\\n\\n“It’s preposterous!” she said pettishly. “Papa’s friends and relations\\ngive me marvellous presents, and all the swells send me paper-knives.\\nIt’s all Jacques’ fault. He’s above all this kind of thing. The\\nFaubourg Saint-Germain hardly knows that we’re engaged.”\\n\\n“He doesn’t go about advertising it,” said Jeanne, smiling.\\n\\n“You’re joking, but all the same what you say is true,” said Germaine.\\n“That’s exactly what his cousin Madame de Relzières said to me the\\nother day at the At Home she gave in my honour—wasn’t it, Sonia?” And\\nshe walked to the window, and, turning her back on them, stared out of\\nit.\\n\\n“She HAS got her mouth full of that At Home,” said Jeanne to Marie in a\\nlow voice.\\n\\nThere was an awkward silence. Marie broke it:\\n\\n“Speaking of Madame de Relzières, do you know that she is on pins and\\nneedles with anxiety? Her son is fighting a duel to-day,” she said.\\n\\n“With whom?” said Sonia.\\n\\n“No one knows. She got hold of a letter from the seconds,” said Marie.\\n\\n“My mind is quite at rest about Relzières,” said Germaine. “He’s a\\nfirst-class swordsman. No one could beat him.”\\n\\nSonia did not seem to share her freedom from anxiety. Her forehead was\\npuckered in little lines of perplexity, as if she were puzzling out\\nsome problem; and there was a look of something very like fear in her\\ngentle eyes.\\n\\n“Wasn’t Relzières a great friend of your fiance at one time?” said\\nJeanne.\\n\\n“A great friend? I should think he was,” said Germaine. “Why, it was\\nthrough Relzières that we got to know Jacques.”\\n\\n“Where was that?” said Marie.\\n\\n“Here—in this very château,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Actually in his own house?” said Marie, in some surprise.\\n\\n“Yes; actually here. Isn’t life funny?” said Germaine. “If, a few\\nmonths after his father’s death, Jacques had not found himself hard-up,\\nand obliged to dispose of this château, to raise the money for his\\nexpedition to the South Pole; and if papa and I had not wanted an\\nhistoric château; and lastly, if papa had not suffered from rheumatism,\\nI should not be calling myself in a month from now the Duchess of\\nCharmerace.”\\n\\n“Now what on earth has your father’s rheumatism got to do with your\\nbeing Duchess of Charmerace?” cried Jeanne.\\n\\n“Everything,” said Germaine. “Papa was afraid that this château was\\ndamp. To prove to papa that he had nothing to fear, Jacques, en grand\\nseigneur, offered him his hospitality, here, at Charmerace, for three\\nweeks.”\\n\\n“That was truly ducal,” said Marie.\\n\\n“But he is always like that,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Oh, he’s all right in that way, little as he cares about society,”\\nsaid Germaine. “Well, by a miracle my father got cured of his\\nrheumatism here. Jacques fell in love with me; papa made up his mind to\\nbuy the château; and I demanded the hand of Jacques in marriage.”\\n\\n“You did? But you were only sixteen then,” said Marie, with some\\nsurprise.\\n\\n“Yes; but even at sixteen a girl ought to know that a duke is a duke. I\\ndid,” said Germaine. “Then since Jacques was setting out for the South\\nPole, and papa considered me much too young to get married, I promised\\nJacques to wait for his return.”\\n\\n“Why, it was everything that’s romantic!” cried Marie.\\n\\n“Romantic? Oh, yes,” said Germaine; and she pouted. “But between\\nourselves, if I’d known that he was going to stay all that time at the\\nSouth Pole—”\\n\\n“That’s true,” broke in Marie. “To go away for three years and stay\\naway seven—at the end of the world.”\\n\\n“All Germaine’s beautiful youth,” said Jeanne, with her malicious\\nsmile.\\n\\n“Thanks!” said Germaine tartly.\\n\\n“Well, you ARE twenty-three. It’s the flower of one’s age,” said\\nJeanne.\\n\\n“Not quite twenty-three,” said Germaine hastily. “And look at the\\nwretched luck I’ve had. The Duke falls ill and is treated at\\nMontevideo. As soon as he recovers, since he’s the most obstinate\\nperson in the world, he resolves to go on with the expedition. He sets\\nout; and for an age, without a word of warning, there’s no more news of\\nhim—no news of any kind. For six months, you know, we believed him\\ndead.”\\n\\n“Dead? Oh, how unhappy you must have been!” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t speak of it! For six months I daren’t put on a light frock,”\\nsaid Germaine, turning to her.\\n\\n“A lot she must have cared for him,” whispered Jeanne to Marie.\\n\\n“Fortunately, one fine day, the letters began again. Three months ago a\\ntelegram informed us that he was coming back; and at last the Duke\\nreturned,” said Germaine, with a theatrical air.\\n\\n“The Duke returned,” cried Jeanne, mimicking her.\\n\\n“Never mind. Fancy waiting nearly seven years for one’s fiance. That\\nwas constancy,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Oh, you’re a sentimentalist, Mlle. Kritchnoff,” said Jeanne, in a tone\\nof mockery. “It was the influence of the castle.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Oh, to own the castle of Charmerace and call oneself Mlle.\\nGournay-Martin—it’s not worth doing. One MUST become a duchess,” said\\nJeanne.\\n\\n“Yes, yes; and for all this wonderful constancy, seven years of it,\\nGermaine was on the point of becoming engaged to another man,” said\\nMarie, smiling.\\n\\n“And he a mere baron,” said Jeanne, laughing.\\n\\n“What? Is that true?” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Didn’t you know, Mlle. Kritchnoff? She nearly became engaged to the\\nDuke’s cousin, the Baron de Relzières. It was not nearly so grand.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s all very well to laugh at me; but being the cousin and heir\\nof the Duke, Relzières would have assumed the title, and I should have\\nbeen Duchess just the same,” said Germaine triumphantly.\\n\\n“Evidently that was all that mattered,” said Jeanne. “Well, dear, I\\nmust be off. We’ve promised to run in to see the Comtesse de Grosjean.\\nYou know the Comtesse de Grosjean?”\\n\\nShe spoke with an air of careless pride, and rose to go.\\n\\n“Only by name. Papa used to know her husband on the Stock Exchange when\\nhe was still called simply M. Grosjean. For his part, papa preferred to\\nkeep his name intact,” said Germaine, with quiet pride.\\n\\n“Intact? That’s one way of looking at it. Well, then, I’ll see you in\\nParis. You still intend to start to-morrow?” said Jeanne.\\n\\n“Yes; to-morrow morning,” said Germaine.\\n\\nJeanne and Marie slipped on their dust-coats to the accompaniment of\\nchattering and kissing, and went out of the room.\\n\\nAs she closed the door on them, Germaine turned to Sonia, and said: “I\\ndo hate those two girls! They’re such horrible snobs.”\\n\\n“Oh, they’re good-natured enough,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Good-natured? Why, you idiot, they’re just bursting with envy of\\nme—bursting!” said Germaine. “Well, they’ve every reason to be,” she\\nadded confidently, surveying herself in a Venetian mirror with a petted\\nchild’s self-content.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\nTHE COMING OF THE CHAROLAIS\\n\\n\\nSonia went back to her table, and once more began putting wedding-cards\\nin their envelopes and addressing them. Germaine moved restlessly about\\nthe room, fidgeting with the bric-a-brac on the cabinets, shifting the\\npieces about, interrupting Sonia to ask whether she preferred this\\narrangement or that, throwing herself into a chair to read a magazine,\\ngetting up in a couple of minutes to straighten a picture on the wall,\\nthrowing out all the while idle questions not worth answering.\\nNinety-nine human beings would have been irritated to exasperation by\\nher fidgeting; Sonia endured it with a perfect patience. Five times\\nGermaine asked her whether she should wear her heliotrope or her pink\\ngown at a forthcoming dinner at Madame de Relzières’. Five times Sonia\\nsaid, without the slightest variation in her tone, “I think you look\\nbetter in the pink.” And all the while the pile of addressed envelopes\\nrose steadily.\\n\\nPresently the door opened, and Alfred stood on the threshold.\\n\\n“Two gentlemen have called to see you, miss,” he said.\\n\\n“Ah, the two Du Buits,” cried Germaine.\\n\\n“They didn’t give their names, miss.”\\n\\n“A gentleman in the prime of life and a younger one?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Yes, miss.”\\n\\n“I thought so. Show them in.”\\n\\n“Yes, miss. And have you any orders for me to give Victoire when we get\\nto Paris?” said Alfred.\\n\\n“No. Are you starting soon?”\\n\\n“Yes, miss. We’re all going by the seven o’clock train. It’s a long way\\nfrom here to Paris; we shall only reach it at nine in the morning. That\\nwill give us just time to get the house ready for you by the time you\\nget there to-morrow evening,” said Alfred.\\n\\n“Is everything packed?”\\n\\n“Yes, miss—everything. The cart has already taken the heavy luggage to\\nthe station. All you’ll have to do is to see after your bags.”\\n\\n“That’s all right. Show M. du Buit and his brother in,” said Germaine.\\n\\nShe moved to a chair near the window, and disposed herself in an\\nattitude of studied, and obviously studied, grace.\\n\\nAs she leant her head at a charming angle back against the tall back of\\nthe chair, her eyes fell on the window, and they opened wide.\\n\\n“Why, whatever’s this?” she cried, pointing to it.\\n\\n“Whatever’s what?” said Sonia, without raising her eyes from the\\nenvelope she was addressing.\\n\\n“Why, the window. Look! one of the panes has been taken out. It looks\\nas if it had been cut.”\\n\\n“So it has—just at the level of the fastening,” said Sonia. And the two\\ngirls stared at the gap.\\n\\n“Haven’t you noticed it before?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“No; the broken glass must have fallen outside,” said Sonia.\\n\\nThe noise of the opening of the door drew their attention from the\\nwindow. Two figures were advancing towards them—a short, round, tubby\\nman of fifty-five, red-faced, bald, with bright grey eyes, which seemed\\nto be continually dancing away from meeting the eyes of any other human\\nbeing. Behind him came a slim young man, dark and grave. For all the\\ndifference in their colouring, it was clear that they were father and\\nson: their eyes were set so close together. The son seemed to have\\ninherited, along with her black eyes, his mother’s nose, thin and\\naquiline; the nose of the father started thin from the brow, but ended\\nin a scarlet bulb eloquent of an exhaustive acquaintance with the\\nvintages of the world.\\n\\nGermaine rose, looking at them with an air of some surprise and\\nuncertainty: these were not her friends, the Du Buits.\\n\\nThe elder man, advancing with a smiling bonhomie, bowed, and said in an\\nadenoid voice, ingratiating of tone: “I’m M. Charolais, young ladies—M.\\nCharolais—retired brewer—chevalier of the Legion of Honour—landowner at\\nRennes. Let me introduce my son.” The young man bowed awkwardly. “We\\ncame from Rennes this morning, and we lunched at Kerlor’s farm.”\\n\\n“Shall I order tea for them?” whispered Sonia.\\n\\n“Gracious, no!” said Germaine sharply under her breath; then, louder,\\nshe said to M. Charolais, “And what is your object in calling?”\\n\\n“We asked to see your father,” said M. Charolais, smiling with broad\\namiability, while his eyes danced across her face, avoiding any meeting\\nwith hers. “The footman told us that M. Gournay-Martin was out, but\\nthat his daughter was at home. And we were unable, quite unable, to\\ndeny ourselves the pleasure of meeting you.” With that he sat down; and\\nhis son followed his example.\\n\\nSonia and Germaine, taken aback, looked at one another in some\\nperplexity.\\n\\n“What a fine château, papa!” said the young man.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy; it’s a very fine château,” said M. Charolais, looking\\nround the hall with appreciative but greedy eyes.\\n\\nThere was a pause.\\n\\n“It’s a very fine château, young ladies,” said M. Charolais.\\n\\n“Yes; but excuse me, what is it you have called about?” said Germaine.\\n\\nM. Charolais crossed his legs, leant back in his chair, thrust his\\nthumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat, and said: “Well, we’ve come\\nabout the advertisement we saw in the RENNES ADVERTISER, that M.\\nGournay-Martin wanted to get rid of a motor-car; and my son is always\\nsaying to me, ‘I should like a motor-car which rushes the hills, papa.’\\nHe means a sixty horse-power.”\\n\\n“We’ve got a sixty horse-power; but it’s not for sale. My father is\\neven using it himself to-day,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Perhaps it’s the car we saw in the stable-yard,” said M. Charolais.\\n\\n“No; that’s a thirty to forty horse-power. It belongs to me. But if\\nyour son really loves rushing hills, as you say, we have a hundred\\nhorse-power car which my father wants to get rid of. Wait; where’s the\\nphotograph of it, Sonia? It ought to be here somewhere.”\\n\\nThe two girls rose, went to a table set against the wall beyond the\\nwindow, and began turning over the papers with which it was loaded in\\nthe search for the photograph. They had barely turned their backs, when\\nthe hand of young Charolais shot out as swiftly as the tongue of a\\nlizard catching a fly, closed round the silver statuette on the top of\\nthe cabinet beside him, and flashed it into his jacket pocket.\\n\\nCharolais was watching the two girls; one would have said that he had\\neyes for nothing else, yet, without moving a muscle of his face, set in\\nits perpetual beaming smile, he hissed in an angry whisper, “Drop it,\\nyou idiot! Put it back!”\\n\\nThe young man scowled askance at him.\\n\\n“Curse you! Put it back!” hissed Charolais.\\n\\nThe young man’s arm shot out with the same quickness, and the statuette\\nstood in its place.\\n\\nThere was just the faintest sigh of relief from Charolais, as Germaine\\nturned and came to him with the photograph in her hand. She gave it to\\nhim.\\n\\n“Ah, here we are,” he said, putting on a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez.\\n“A hundred horse-power car. Well, well, this is something to talk over.\\nWhat’s the least you’ll take for it?”\\n\\n“_I_ have nothing to do with this kind of thing,” cried Germaine. “You\\nmust see my father. He will be back from Rennes soon. Then you can\\nsettle the matter with him.”\\n\\nM. Charolais rose, and said: “Very good. We will go now, and come back\\npresently. I’m sorry to have intruded on you, young ladies—taking up\\nyour time like this—”\\n\\n“Not at all—not at all,” murmured Germaine politely.\\n\\n“Good-bye—good-bye,” said M. Charolais; and he and his son went to the\\ndoor, and bowed themselves out.\\n\\n“What creatures!” said Germaine, going to the window, as the door\\nclosed behind the two visitors. “All the same, if they do buy the\\nhundred horse-power, papa will be awfully pleased. It is odd about that\\npane. I wonder how it happened. It’s odd too that Jacques hasn’t come\\nback yet. He told me that he would be here between half-past four and\\nfive.”\\n\\n“And the Du Buits have not come either,” said Sonia. “But it’s hardly\\nfive yet.”\\n\\n“Yes; that’s so. The Du Buits have not come either. What on earth are\\nyou wasting your time for?” she added sharply, raising her voice. “Just\\nfinish addressing those letters while you’re waiting.”\\n\\n“They’re nearly finished,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Nearly isn’t quite. Get on with them, can’t you!” snapped Germaine.\\n\\nSonia went back to the writing-table; just the slightest deepening of\\nthe faint pink roses in her cheeks marked her sense of Germaine’s\\nrudeness. After three years as companion to Germaine Gournay-Martin,\\nshe was well inured to millionaire manners; they had almost lost the\\npower to move her.\\n\\nGermaine dropped into a chair for twenty seconds; then flung out of it.\\n\\n“Ten minutes to five!” she cried. “Jacques is late. It’s the first time\\nI’ve ever known him late.”\\n\\nShe went to the window, and looked across the wide stretch of\\nmeadow-land and woodland on which the château, set on the very crown of\\nthe ridge, looked down. The road, running with the irritating\\nstraightness of so many of the roads of France, was visible for a full\\nthree miles. It was empty.\\n\\n“Perhaps the Duke went to the château de Relzières to see his\\ncousin—though I fancy that at bottom the Duke does not care very much\\nfor the Baron de Relzières. They always look as though they detested\\none another,” said Sonia, without raising her eyes from the letter she\\nwas addressing.\\n\\n“You’ve noticed that, have you?” said Germaine. “Now, as far as Jacques\\nis concerned—he’s—he’s so indifferent. None the less, when we were at\\nthe Relzières on Thursday, I caught him quarrelling with Paul de\\nRelzières.”\\n\\n“Quarrelling?” said Sonia sharply, with a sudden uneasiness in air and\\neyes and voice.\\n\\n“Yes; quarrelling. And they said good-bye to one another in the oddest\\nway.”\\n\\n“But surely they shook hands?” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Not a bit of it. They bowed as if each of them had swallowed a poker.”\\n\\n“Why—then—then—” said Sonia, starting up with a frightened air; and her\\nvoice stuck in her throat.\\n\\n“Then what?” said Germaine, a little startled by her panic-stricken\\nface.\\n\\n“The duel! Monsieur de Relzières’ duel!” cried Sonia.\\n\\n“What? You don’t think it was with Jacques?”\\n\\n“I don’t know—but this quarrel—the Duke’s manner this morning—the Du\\nBuits’ drive—” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Of course—of course! It’s quite possible—in fact it’s certain!” cried\\nGermaine.\\n\\n“It’s horrible!” gasped Sonia. “Consider—just consider! Suppose\\nsomething happened to him. Suppose the Duke—”\\n\\n“It’s me the Duke’s fighting about!” cried Germaine proudly, with a\\nlittle skipping jump of triumphant joy.\\n\\nSonia stared through her without seeing her. Her face was a dead\\nwhite—fear had chilled the lustre from her skin; her breath panted\\nthrough her parted lips; and her dilated eyes seemed to look on some\\ndreadful picture.\\n\\nGermaine pirouetted about the hall at the very height of triumph. To\\nhave a Duke fighting a duel about her was far beyond the wildest dreams\\nof snobbishness. She chuckled again and again, and once she clapped her\\nhands and laughed aloud.\\n\\n“He’s fighting a swordsman of the first class—an invincible\\nswordsman—you said so yourself,” Sonia muttered in a tone of anguish.\\n“And there’s nothing to be done—nothing.”\\n\\nShe pressed her hands to her eyes as if to shut out a hideous vision.\\n\\nGermaine did not hear her; she was staring at herself in a mirror, and\\nbridling to her own image.\\n\\nSonia tottered to the window and stared down at the road along which\\nmust come the tidings of weal or irremediable woe. She kept passing her\\nhand over her eyes as if to clear their vision.\\n\\nSuddenly she started, and bent forward, rigid, all her being\\nconcentrated in the effort to see.\\n\\nThen she cried: “Mademoiselle Germaine! Look! Look!”\\n\\n“What is it?” said Germaine, coming to her side.\\n\\n“A horseman! Look! There!” said Sonia, waving a hand towards the road.\\n\\n“Yes; and isn’t he galloping!” said Germaine.\\n\\n“It’s he! It’s the Duke!” cried Sonia.\\n\\n“Do you think so?” said Germaine doubtfully.\\n\\n“I’m sure of it—sure!”\\n\\n“Well, he gets here just in time for tea,” said Germaine in a tone of\\nextreme satisfaction. “He knows that I hate to be kept waiting. He said\\nto me, ‘I shall be back by five at the latest.’ And here he is.”\\n\\n“It’s impossible,” said Sonia. “He has to go all the way round the\\npark. There’s no direct road; the brook is between us.”\\n\\n“All the same, he’s coming in a straight line,” said Germaine.\\n\\nIt was true. The horseman had left the road and was galloping across\\nthe meadows straight for the brook. In twenty seconds he reached its\\ntreacherous bank, and as he set his horse at it, Sonia covered her\\neyes.\\n\\n“He’s over!” said Germaine. “My father gave three hundred guineas for\\nthat horse.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\nLUPIN’S WAY\\n\\n\\nSonia, in a sudden revulsion of feeling, in a reaction from her fears,\\nslipped back and sat down at the tea-table, panting quickly, struggling\\nto keep back the tears of relief. She did not see the Duke gallop up\\nthe slope, dismount, and hand over his horse to the groom who came\\nrunning to him. There was still a mist in her eyes to blur his figure\\nas he came through the window.\\n\\n“If it’s for me, plenty of tea, very little cream, and three lumps of\\nsugar,” he cried in a gay, ringing voice, and pulled out his watch.\\n“Five to the minute—that’s all right.” And he bent down, took\\nGermaine’s hand, and kissed it with an air of gallant devotion.\\n\\nIf he had indeed just fought a duel, there were no signs of it in his\\nbearing. His air, his voice, were entirely careless. He was a man whose\\nwhole thought at the moment was fixed on his tea and his punctuality.\\n\\nHe drew a chair near the tea-table for Germaine; sat down himself; and\\nSonia handed him a cup of tea with so shaky a hand that the spoon\\nclinked in the saucer.\\n\\n“You’ve been fighting a duel?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“What! You’ve heard already?” said the Duke in some surprise.\\n\\n“I’ve heard,” said Germaine. “Why did you fight it?”\\n\\n“You’re not wounded, your Grace?” said Sonia anxiously.\\n\\n“Not a scratch,” said the Duke, smiling at her.\\n\\n“Will you be so good as to get on with those wedding-cards, Sonia,”\\nsaid Germaine sharply; and Sonia went back to the writing-table.\\n\\nTurning to the Duke, Germaine said, “Did you fight on my account?”\\n\\n“Would you be pleased to know that I had fought on your account?” said\\nthe Duke; and there was a faint mocking light in his eyes, far too\\nfaint for the self-satisfied Germaine to perceive.\\n\\n“Yes. But it isn’t true. You’ve been fighting about some woman,” said\\nGermaine petulantly.\\n\\n“If I had been fighting about a woman, it could only be you,” said the\\nDuke.\\n\\n“Yes, that is so. Of course. It could hardly be about Sonia, or my\\nmaid,” said Germaine. “But what was the reason of the duel?”\\n\\n“Oh, the reason of it was entirely childish,” said the Duke. “I was in\\na bad temper; and De Relzières said something that annoyed me.”\\n\\n“Then it wasn’t about me; and if it wasn’t about me, it wasn’t really\\nworth while fighting,” said Germaine in a tone of acute disappointment.\\n\\nThe mocking light deepened a little in the Duke’s eyes.\\n\\n“Yes. But if I had been killed, everybody would have said, ‘The Duke of\\nCharmerace has been killed in a duel about Mademoiselle\\nGournay-Martin.’ That would have sounded very fine indeed,” said the\\nDuke; and a touch of mockery had crept into his voice.\\n\\n“Now, don’t begin trying to annoy me again,” said Germaine pettishly.\\n\\n“The last thing I should dream of, my dear girl,” said the Duke,\\nsmiling.\\n\\n“And De Relzières? Is he wounded?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Poor dear De Relzières: he won’t be out of bed for the next six\\nmonths,” said the Duke; and he laughed lightly and gaily.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” cried Germaine.\\n\\n“It will do poor dear De Relzières a world of good. He has a touch of\\nenteritis; and for enteritis there is nothing like rest,” said the\\nDuke.\\n\\nSonia was not getting on very quickly with the wedding-cards. Germaine\\nwas sitting with her back to her; and over her shoulder Sonia could\\nwatch the face of the Duke—an extraordinarily mobile face, changing\\nwith every passing mood. Sometimes his eyes met hers; and hers fell\\nbefore them. But as soon as they turned away from her she was watching\\nhim again, almost greedily, as if she could not see enough of his face\\nin which strength of will and purpose was mingled with a faint, ironic\\nscepticism, and tempered by a fine air of race.\\n\\nHe finished his tea; then he took a morocco case from his pocket, and\\nsaid to Germaine, “It must be quite three days since I gave you\\nanything.”\\n\\nHe opened the case, disclosed a pearl pendant, and handed it to her.\\n\\n“Oh, how nice!” she cried, taking it.\\n\\nShe took it from the case, saying that it was a beauty. She showed it\\nto Sonia; then she put it on and stood before a mirror admiring the\\neffect. To tell the truth, the effect was not entirely desirable. The\\npearls did not improve the look of her rather coarse brown skin; and\\nher skin added nothing to the beauty of the pearls. Sonia saw this, and\\nso did the Duke. He looked at Sonia’s white throat. She met his eyes\\nand blushed. She knew that the same thought was in both their minds;\\nthe pearls would have looked infinitely better there.\\n\\nGermaine finished admiring herself; she was incapable even of\\nsuspecting that so expensive a pendant could not suit her perfectly.\\n\\nThe Duke said idly: “Goodness! Are all those invitations to the\\nwedding?”\\n\\n“That’s only down to the letter V,” said Germaine proudly.\\n\\n“And there are twenty-five letters in the alphabet! You must be\\ninviting the whole world. You’ll have to have the Madeleine enlarged.\\nIt won’t hold them all. There isn’t a church in Paris that will,” said\\nthe Duke.\\n\\n“Won’t it be a splendid marriage!” said Germaine. “There’ll be\\nsomething like a crush. There are sure to be accidents.”\\n\\n“If I were you, I should have careful arrangements made,” said the\\nDuke.\\n\\n“Oh, let people look after themselves. They’ll remember it better if\\nthey’re crushed a little,” said Germaine.\\n\\nThere was a flicker of contemptuous wonder in the Duke’s eyes. But he\\nonly shrugged his shoulders, and turning to Sonia, said, “Will you be\\nan angel and play me a little Grieg, Mademoiselle Kritchnoff? I heard\\nyou playing yesterday. No one plays Grieg like you.”\\n\\n“Excuse me, Jacques, but Mademoiselle Kritchnoff has her work to do,”\\nsaid Germaine tartly.\\n\\n“Five minutes’ interval—just a morsel of Grieg, I beg,” said the Duke,\\nwith an irresistible smile.\\n\\n“All right,” said Germaine grudgingly. “But I’ve something important to\\ntalk to you about.”\\n\\n“By Jove! So have I. I was forgetting. I’ve the last photograph I took\\nof you and Mademoiselle Sonia.” Germaine frowned and shrugged her\\nshoulders. “With your light frocks in the open air, you look like two\\nbig flowers,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“You call that important!” cried Germaine.\\n\\n“It’s very important—like all trifles,” said the Duke, smiling. “Look!\\nisn’t it nice?” And he took a photograph from his pocket, and held it\\nout to her.\\n\\n“Nice? It’s shocking! We’re making the most appalling faces,” said\\nGermaine, looking at the photograph in his hand.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps you ARE making faces,” said the Duke seriously,\\nconsidering the photograph with grave earnestness. “But they’re not\\nappalling faces—not by any means. You shall be judge, Mademoiselle\\nSonia. The faces—well, we won’t talk about the faces—but the outlines.\\nLook at the movement of your scarf.” And he handed the photograph to\\nSonia.\\n\\n“Jacques!” said Germaine impatiently.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, you’ve something important to tell me. What is it?” said the\\nDuke, with an air of resignation; and he took the photograph from Sonia\\nand put it carefully back in his pocket.\\n\\n“Victoire has telephoned from Paris to say that we’ve had a paper-knife\\nand a Louis Seize inkstand given us,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Hurrah!” cried the Duke in a sudden shout that made them both jump.\\n\\n“And a pearl necklace,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Hurrah!” cried the Duke.\\n\\n“You’re perfectly childish,” said Germaine pettishly. “I tell you we’ve\\nbeen given a paper-knife, and you shout ‘hurrah!’ I say we’ve been\\ngiven a pearl necklace, and you shout ‘hurrah!’ You can’t have the\\nslightest sense of values.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon. This pearl necklace is from one of your father’s\\nfriends, isn’t it?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes; why?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“But the inkstand and the paper-knife must be from the Faubourg\\nSaint-Germain, and well on the shabby side?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes; well?”\\n\\n“Well then, my dear girl, what are you complaining about? They balance;\\nthe equilibrium is restored. You can’t have everything,” said the Duke;\\nand he laughed mischievously.\\n\\nGermaine flushed, and bit her lip; her eyes sparkled.\\n\\n“You don’t care a rap about me,” she said stormily.\\n\\n“But I find you adorable,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“You keep annoying me,” said Germaine pettishly. “And you do it on\\npurpose. I think it’s in very bad taste. I shall end by taking a\\ndislike to you—I know I shall.”\\n\\n“Wait till we’re married for that, my dear girl,” said the Duke; and he\\nlaughed again, with a blithe, boyish cheerfulness, which deepened the\\nangry flush in Germaine’s cheeks.\\n\\n“Can’t you be serious about anything?” she cried.\\n\\n“I am the most serious man in Europe,” said the Duke.\\n\\nGermaine went to the window and stared out of it sulkily.\\n\\nThe Duke walked up and down the hall, looking at the pictures of some\\nof his ancestors—somewhat grotesque persons—with humorous appreciation.\\nBetween addressing the envelopes Sonia kept glancing at him. Once he\\ncaught her eye, and smiled at her. Germaine’s back was eloquent of her\\ndispleasure. The Duke stopped at a gap in the line of pictures in which\\nthere hung a strip of old tapestry.\\n\\n“I can never understand why you have left all these ancestors of mine\\nstaring from the walls and have taken away the quite admirable and\\ninteresting portrait of myself,” he said carelessly.\\n\\nGermaine turned sharply from the window; Sonia stopped in the middle of\\naddressing an envelope; and both the girls stared at him in\\nastonishment.\\n\\n“There certainly was a portrait of me where that tapestry hangs. What\\nhave you done with it?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“You’re making fun of us again,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Surely your Grace knows what happened,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“We wrote all the details to you and sent you all the papers three\\nyears ago. Didn’t you get them?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Not a detail or a newspaper. Three years ago I was in the\\nneighbourhood of the South Pole, and lost at that,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“But it was most dramatic, my dear Jacques. All Paris was talking of\\nit,” said Germaine. “Your portrait was stolen.”\\n\\n“Stolen? Who stole it?” said the Duke.\\n\\nGermaine crossed the hall quickly to the gap in the line of pictures.\\n\\n“I’ll show you,” she said.\\n\\nShe drew aside the piece of tapestry, and in the middle of the panel\\nover which the portrait of the Duke had hung he saw written in chalk\\nthe words:\\n\\nARSÈNE LUPIN\\n\\n“What do you think of that autograph?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“‘Arsène Lupin?’” said the Duke in a tone of some bewilderment.\\n\\n“He left his signature. It seems that he always does so,” said Sonia in\\nan explanatory tone.\\n\\n“But who is he?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin? Surely you know who Arsène Lupin is?” said Germaine\\nimpatiently.\\n\\n“I haven’t the slightest notion,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, come! No one is as South-Pole as all that!” cried Germaine. “You\\ndon’t know who Lupin is? The most whimsical, the most audacious, and\\nthe most genial thief in France. For the last ten years he has kept the\\npolice at bay. He has baffled Ganimard, Holmlock Shears, the great\\nEnglish detective, and even Guerchard, whom everybody says is the\\ngreatest detective we’ve had in France since Vidocq. In fact, he’s our\\nnational robber. Do you mean to say you don’t know him?”\\n\\n“Not even enough to ask him to lunch at a restaurant,” said the Duke\\nflippantly. “What’s he like?”\\n\\n“Like? Nobody has the slightest idea. He has a thousand disguises. He\\nhas dined two evenings running at the English Embassy.”\\n\\n“But if nobody knows him, how did they learn that?” said the Duke, with\\na puzzled air.\\n\\n“Because the second evening, about ten o’clock, they noticed that one\\nof the guests had disappeared, and with him all the jewels of the\\nambassadress.”\\n\\n“All of them?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes; and Lupin left his card behind him with these words scribbled on\\nit:”\\n\\n“‘This is not a robbery; it is a restitution. You took the Wallace\\ncollection from us.’”\\n\\n“But it was a hoax, wasn’t it?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No, your Grace; and he has done better than that. You remember the\\naffair of the Daray Bank—the savings bank for poor people?” said Sonia,\\nher gentle face glowing with a sudden enthusiastic animation.\\n\\n“Let’s see,” said the Duke. “Wasn’t that the financier who doubled his\\nfortune at the expense of a heap of poor wretches and ruined two\\nthousand people?”\\n\\n“Yes; that’s the man,” said Sonia. “And Lupin stripped Daray’s house\\nand took from him everything he had in his strong-box. He didn’t leave\\nhim a sou of the money. And then, when he’d taken it from him, he\\ndistributed it among all the poor wretches whom Daray had ruined.”\\n\\n“But this isn’t a thief you’re talking about—it’s a philanthropist,”\\nsaid the Duke.\\n\\n“A fine sort of philanthropist!” broke in Germaine in a peevish tone.\\n“There was a lot of philanthropy about his robbing papa, wasn’t there?”\\n\\n“Well,” said the Duke, with an air of profound reflection, “if you come\\nto think of it, that robbery was not worthy of this national hero. My\\nportrait, if you except the charm and beauty of the face itself, is not\\nworth much.”\\n\\n“If you think he was satisfied with your portrait, you’re very much\\nmistaken. All my father’s collections were robbed,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Your father’s collections?” said the Duke. “But they’re better guarded\\nthan the Bank of France. Your father is as careful of them as the apple\\nof his eye.”\\n\\n“That’s exactly it—he was too careful of them. That’s why Lupin\\nsucceeded.”\\n\\n“This is very interesting,” said the Duke; and he sat down on a couch\\nbefore the gap in the pictures, to go into the matter more at his ease.\\n“I suppose he had accomplices in the house itself?”\\n\\n“Yes, one accomplice,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Who was that?” asked the Duke.\\n\\n“Papa!” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Oh, come! what on earth do you mean?” said the Duke. “You’re getting\\nquite incomprehensible, my dear girl.”\\n\\n“Well, I’ll make it clear to you. One morning papa received a\\nletter—but wait. Sonia, get me the Lupin papers out of the bureau.”\\n\\nSonia rose from the writing-table, and went to a bureau, an admirable\\nexample of the work of the great English maker, Chippendale. It stood\\non the other side of the hall between an Oriental cabinet and a\\nsixteenth-century Italian cabinet—for all the world as if it were\\nstanding in a crowded curiosity shop—with the natural effect that the\\nthree pieces, by their mere incongruity, took something each from the\\nbeauty of the other. Sonia raised the flap of the bureau, and taking\\nfrom one of the drawers a small portfolio, turned over the papers in it\\nand handed a letter to the Duke.\\n\\n“This is the envelope,” she said. “It’s addressed to M. Gournay-Martin,\\nCollector, at the château de Charmerace, Ile-et-Vilaine.”\\n\\nThe Duke opened the envelope and took out a letter.\\n\\n“It’s an odd handwriting,” he said.\\n\\n“Read it—carefully,” said Germaine.\\n\\nIt was an uncommon handwriting. The letters of it were small, but\\nperfectly formed. It looked the handwriting of a man who knew exactly\\nwhat he wanted to say, and liked to say it with extreme precision. The\\nletter ran:\\n\\n“DEAR SIR,”\\n\\n\\n“Please forgive my writing to you without our having been introduced to\\none another; but I flatter myself that you know me, at any rate, by\\nname.”\\n\\n\\n“There is in the drawing-room next your hall a Gainsborough of\\nadmirable quality which affords me infinite pleasure. Your Goyas in the\\nsame drawing-room are also to my liking, as well as your Van Dyck. In\\nthe further drawing-room I note the Renaissance cabinets—a marvellous\\npair—the Flemish tapestry, the Fragonard, the clock signed Boulle, and\\nvarious other objects of less importance. But above all I have set my\\nheart on that coronet which you bought at the sale of the Marquise de\\nFerronaye, and which was formerly worn by the unfortunate Princesse de\\nLamballe. I take the greatest interest in this coronet: in the first\\nplace, on account of the charming and tragic memories which it calls up\\nin the mind of a poet passionately fond of history, and in the second\\nplace—though it is hardly worth while talking about that kind of\\nthing—on account of its intrinsic value. I reckon indeed that the\\nstones in your coronet are, at the very lowest, worth half a million\\nfrancs.”\\n\\n\\n“I beg you, my dear sir, to have these different objects properly\\npacked up, and to forward them, addressed to me, carriage paid, to the\\nBatignolles Station. Failing this, I shall Proceed to remove them\\nmyself on the night of Thursday, August 7th.”\\n\\n\\n“Please pardon the slight trouble to which I am putting you, and\\nbelieve me,”\\n\\n\\n“Yours very sincerely,”\\n“ARSÈNE LUPIN.”\\n\\n\\n“P.S.—It occurs to me that the pictures have not glass before them. It\\nwould be as well to repair this omission before forwarding them to me,\\nand I am sure that you will take this extra trouble cheerfully. I am\\naware, of course, that some of the best judges declare that a picture\\nloses some of its quality when seen through glass. But it preserves\\nthem, and we should always be ready and willing to sacrifice a portion\\nof our own pleasure for the benefit of posterity. France demands it of\\nus.—A. L.”\\n\\n\\nThe Duke laughed, and said, “Really, this is extraordinarily funny. It\\nmust have made your father laugh.”\\n\\n“Laugh?” said Germaine. “You should have seen his face. He took it\\nseriously enough, I can tell you.”\\n\\n“Not to the point of forwarding the things to Batignolles, I hope,”\\nsaid the Duke.\\n\\n“No, but to the point of being driven wild,” said Germaine. “And since\\nthe police had always been baffled by Lupin, he had the brilliant idea\\nof trying what soldiers could do. The Commandant at Rennes is a great\\nfriend of papa’s; and papa went to him, and told him about Lupin’s\\nletter and what he feared. The colonel laughed at him; but he offered\\nhim a corporal and six soldiers to guard his collection, on the night\\nof the seventh. It was arranged that they should come from Rennes by\\nthe last train so that the burglars should have no warning of their\\ncoming. Well, they came, seven picked men—men who had seen service in\\nTonquin. We gave them supper; and then the corporal posted them in the\\nhall and the two drawing-rooms where the pictures and things were. At\\neleven we all went to bed, after promising the corporal that, in the\\nevent of any fight with the burglars, we would not stir from our rooms.\\nI can tell you I felt awfully nervous. I couldn’t get to sleep for ages\\nand ages. Then, when I did, I did not wake till morning. The night had\\npassed absolutely quietly. Nothing out of the common had happened.\\nThere had not been the slightest noise. I awoke Sonia and my father. We\\ndressed as quickly as we could, and rushed down to the drawing-room.”\\n\\nShe paused dramatically.\\n\\n“Well?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Well, it was done.”\\n\\n“What was done?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Everything,” said Germaine. “Pictures had gone, tapestries had gone,\\ncabinets had gone, and the clock had gone.”\\n\\n“And the coronet too?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, no. That was at the Bank of France. And it was doubtless to make\\nup for not getting it that Lupin stole your portrait. At any rate he\\ndidn’t say that he was going to steal it in his letter.”\\n\\n“But, come! this is incredible. Had he hypnotized the corporal and the\\nsix soldiers? Or had he murdered them all?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Corporal? There wasn’t any corporal, and there weren’t any soldiers.\\nThe corporal was Lupin, and the soldiers were part of his gang,” said\\nGermaine.\\n\\n“I don’t understand,” said the Duke. “The colonel promised your father\\na corporal and six men. Didn’t they come?”\\n\\n“They came to the railway station all right,” said Germaine. “But you\\nknow the little inn half-way between the railway station and the\\nchâteau? They stopped to drink there, and at eleven o’clock next\\nmorning one of the villagers found all seven of them, along with the\\nfootman who was guiding them to the château, sleeping like logs in the\\nlittle wood half a mile from the inn. Of course the innkeeper could not\\nexplain when their wine was drugged. He could only tell us that a\\nmotorist, who had stopped at the inn to get some supper, had called the\\nsoldiers in and insisted on standing them drinks. They had seemed a\\nlittle fuddled before they left the inn, and the motorist had insisted\\non driving them to the château in his car. When the drug took effect he\\nsimply carried them out of it one by one, and laid them in the wood to\\nsleep it off.”\\n\\n“Lupin seems to have made a thorough job of it, anyhow,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“I should think so,” said Germaine. “Guerchard was sent down from\\nParis; but he could not find a single clue. It was not for want of\\ntrying, for he hates Lupin. It’s a regular fight between them, and so\\nfar Lupin has scored every point.”\\n\\n“He must be as clever as they make ’em,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“He is,” said Germaine. “And do you know, I shouldn’t be at all\\nsurprised if he’s in the neighbourhood now.”\\n\\n“What on earth do you mean?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“I’m not joking,” said Germaine. “Odd things are happening. Some one\\nhas been changing the place of things. That silver statuette now—it was\\non the cabinet, and we found it moved to the piano. Yet nobody had\\ntouched it. And look at this window. Some one has broken a pane in it\\njust at the height of the fastening.”\\n\\n“The deuce they have!” said the Duke.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\nTHE DUKE INTERVENES\\n\\n\\nThe Duke rose, came to the window, and looked at the broken pane. He\\nstepped out on to the terrace and looked at the turf; then he came back\\ninto the room.\\n\\n“This looks serious,” he said. “That pane has not been broken at all.\\nIf it had been broken, the pieces of glass would be lying on the turf.\\nIt has been cut out. We must warn your father to look to his\\ntreasures.”\\n\\n“I told you so,” said Germaine. “I said that Arsène Lupin was in the\\nneighbourhood.”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin is a very capable man,” said the Duke, smiling. “But\\nthere’s no reason to suppose that he’s the only burglar in France or\\neven in Ile-et-Vilaine.”\\n\\n“I’m sure that he’s in the neighbourhood. I have a feeling that he is,”\\nsaid Germaine stubbornly.\\n\\nThe Duke shrugged his shoulders, and said a smile: “Far be it from me\\nto contradict you. A woman’s intuition is always—well, it’s always a\\nwoman’s intuition.”\\n\\nHe came back into the hall, and as he did so the door opened and a\\nshock-headed man in the dress of a gamekeeper stood on the threshold.\\n\\n“There are visitors to see you, Mademoiselle Germaine,” he said, in a\\nvery deep bass voice.\\n\\n“What! Are you answering the door, Firmin?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Yes, Mademoiselle Germaine: there’s only me to do it. All the servants\\nhave started for the station, and my wife and I are going to see after\\nthe family to-night and to-morrow morning. Shall I show these gentlemen\\nin?”\\n\\n“Who are they?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Two gentlemen who say they have an appointment.”\\n\\n“What are their names?” said Germaine.\\n\\n“They are two gentlemen. I don’t know what their names are. I’ve no\\nmemory for names.”\\n\\n“That’s an advantage to any one who answers doors,” said the Duke,\\nsmiling at the stolid Firmin.\\n\\n“Well, it can’t be the two Charolais again. It’s not time for them to\\ncome back. I told them papa would not be back yet,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“No, it can’t be them, Mademoiselle Germaine,” said Firmin, with\\ndecision.\\n\\n“Very well; show them in,” she said.\\n\\nFirmin went out, leaving the door open behind him; and they heard his\\nhob-nailed boots clatter and squeak on the stone floor of the outer\\nhall.\\n\\n“Charolais?” said the Duke idly. “I don’t know the name. Who are they?”\\n\\n“A little while ago Alfred announced two gentlemen. I thought they were\\nGeorges and Andre du Buit, for they promised to come to tea. I told\\nAlfred to show them in, and to my surprise there appeared two horrible\\nprovincials. I never—Oh!”\\n\\nShe stopped short, for there, coming through the door, were the two\\nCharolais, father and son.\\n\\nM. Charolais pressed his motor-cap to his bosom, and bowed low. “Once\\nmore I salute you, mademoiselle,” he said.\\n\\nHis son bowed, and revealed behind him another young man.\\n\\n“My second son. He has a chemist’s shop,” said M. Charolais, waving a\\nlarge red hand at the young man.\\n\\nThe young man, also blessed with the family eyes, set close together,\\nentered the hall and bowed to the two girls. The Duke raised his\\neyebrows ever so slightly.\\n\\n“I’m very sorry, gentlemen,” said Germaine, “but my father has not yet\\nreturned.”\\n\\n“Please don’t apologize. There is not the slightest need,” said M.\\nCharolais; and he and his two sons settled themselves down on three\\nchairs, with the air of people who had come to make a considerable\\nstay.\\n\\nFor a moment, Germaine, taken aback by their coolness, was speechless;\\nthen she said hastily: “Very likely he won’t be back for another hour.\\nI shouldn’t like you to waste your time.”\\n\\n“Oh, it doesn’t matter,” said M. Charolais, with an indulgent air; and\\nturning to the Duke, he added, “However, while we’re waiting, if you’re\\na member of the family, sir, we might perhaps discuss the least you\\nwill take for the motor-car.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” said the Duke, “but I have nothing to do with it.”\\n\\nBefore M. Charolais could reply the door opened, and Firmin’s deep\\nvoice said:\\n\\n“Will you please come in here, sir?”\\n\\nA third young man came into the hall.\\n\\n“What, you here, Bernard?” said M. Charolais. “I told you to wait at\\nthe park gates.”\\n\\n“I wanted to see the car too,” said Bernard.\\n\\n“My third son. He is destined for the Bar,” said M. Charolais, with a\\ngreat air of paternal pride.\\n\\n“But how many are there?” said Germaine faintly.\\n\\nBefore M. Charolais could answer, Firmin once more appeared on the\\nthreshold.\\n\\n“The master’s just come back, miss,” he said.\\n\\n“Thank goodness for that!” said Germaine; and turning to M. Charolais,\\nshe added, “If you will come with me, gentlemen, I will take you to my\\nfather, and you can discuss the price of the car at once.”\\n\\nAs she spoke she moved towards the door. M. Charolais and his sons rose\\nand made way for her. The father and the two eldest sons made haste to\\nfollow her out of the room. But Bernard lingered behind, apparently to\\nadmire the bric-a-brac on the cabinets. With infinite quickness he\\ngrabbed two objects off the nearest, and followed his brothers. The\\nDuke sprang across the hall in three strides, caught him by the arm on\\nthe very threshold, jerked him back into the hall, and shut the door.\\n\\n“No you don’t, my young friend,” he said sharply.\\n\\n“Don’t what?” said Bernard, trying to shake off his grip.\\n\\n“You’ve taken a cigarette-case,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No, no, I haven’t—nothing of the kind!” stammered Bernard.\\n\\nThe Duke grasped the young man’s left wrist, plunged his hand into the\\nmotor-cap which he was carrying, drew out of it a silver\\ncigarette-case, and held it before his eyes.\\n\\nBernard turned pale to the lips. His frightened eyes seemed about to\\nleap from their sockets.\\n\\n“It—it—was a m-m-m-mistake,” he stammered.\\n\\nThe Duke shifted his grip to his collar, and thrust his hand into the\\nbreast-pocket of his coat. Bernard, helpless in his grip, and utterly\\ntaken aback by his quickness, made no resistance.\\n\\nThe Duke drew out a morocco case, and said: “Is this a mistake too?”\\n\\n“Heavens! The pendant!” cried Sonia, who was watching the scene with\\nparted lips and amazed eyes.\\n\\nBernard dropped on his knees and clasped his hands.\\n\\n“Forgive me!” he cried, in a choking voice. “Forgive me! Don’t tell any\\none! For God’s sake, don’t tell any one!”\\n\\nAnd the tears came streaming from his eyes.\\n\\n“You young rogue!” said the Duke quietly.\\n\\n“I’ll never do it again—never! Oh, have pity on me! If my father knew!\\nOh, let me off!” cried Bernard.\\n\\nThe Duke hesitated, and looked down on him, frowning and pulling at his\\nmoustache. Then, more quickly than one would have expected from so\\ncareless a trifler, his mind was made up.\\n\\n“All right,” he said slowly. “Just for this once ... be off with you.”\\nAnd he jerked him to his feet and almost threw him into the outer hall.\\n\\n“Thanks! ... oh, thanks!” said Bernard.\\n\\nThe Duke shut the door and looked at Sonia, breathing quickly.\\n\\n“Well? Did you ever see anything like that? That young fellow will go a\\nlong way. The cheek of the thing! Right under our very eyes! And this\\npendant, too: it would have been a pity to lose it. Upon my word, I\\nought to have handed him over to the police.”\\n\\n“No, no!” cried Sonia. “You did quite right to let him off—quite\\nright.”\\n\\nThe Duke set the pendant on the ledge of the bureau, and came down the\\nhall to Sonia.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” he said gently. “You’re quite pale.”\\n\\n“It has upset me ... that unfortunate boy,” said Sonia; and her eyes\\nwere swimming with tears.\\n\\n“Do you pity the young rogue?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes; it’s dreadful. His eyes were so terrified, and so boyish. And, to\\nbe caught like that ... stealing ... in the act. Oh, it’s hateful!”\\n\\n“Come, come, how sensitive you are!” said the Duke, in a soothing,\\nalmost caressing tone. His eyes, resting on her charming, troubled\\nface, were glowing with a warm admiration.\\n\\n“Yes; it’s silly,” said Sonia; “but you noticed his eyes—the hunted\\nlook in them? You pitied him, didn’t you? For you are kind at bottom.”\\n\\n“Why at bottom?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, I said at bottom because you look sarcastic, and at first sight\\nyou’re so cold. But often that’s only the mask of those who have\\nsuffered the most.... They are the most indulgent,” said Sonia slowly,\\nhesitating, picking her words.\\n\\n“Yes, I suppose they are,” said the Duke thoughtfully.\\n\\n“It’s because when one has suffered one understands.... Yes: one\\nunderstands,” said Sonia.\\n\\nThere was a pause. The Duke’s eyes still rested on her face. The\\nadmiration in them was mingled with compassion.\\n\\n“You’re very unhappy here, aren’t you?” he said gently.\\n\\n“Me? Why?” said Sonia quickly.\\n\\n“Your smile is so sad, and your eyes so timid,” said the Duke slowly.\\n“You’re just like a little child one longs to protect. Are you quite\\nalone in the world?”\\n\\nHis eyes and tones were full of pity; and a faint flush mantled Sonia’s\\ncheeks.\\n\\n“Yes, I’m alone,” she said.\\n\\n“But have you no relations—no friends?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“I don’t mean here in France, but in your own country.... Surely you\\nhave some in Russia?”\\n\\n“No, not a soul. You see, my father was a Revolutionist. He died in\\nSiberia when I was a baby. And my mother, she died too—in Paris. She\\nhad fled from Russia. I was two years old when she died.”\\n\\n“It must be hard to be alone like that,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No,” said Sonia, with a faint smile, “I don’t mind having no\\nrelations. I grew used to that so young ... so very young. But what is\\nhard—but you’ll laugh at me—”\\n\\n“Heaven forbid!” said the Duke gravely.\\n\\n“Well, what is hard is, never to get a letter ... an envelope that one\\nopens ... from some one who thinks about one—”\\n\\nShe paused, and then added gravely: “But I tell myself that it’s\\nnonsense. I have a certain amount of philosophy.”\\n\\nShe smiled at him—an adorable child’s smile.\\n\\nThe Duke smiled too. “A certain amount of philosophy,” he said softly.\\n“You look like a philosopher!”\\n\\nAs they stood looking at one another with serious eyes, almost with\\neyes that probed one another’s souls, the drawing-room door flung open,\\nand Germaine’s harsh voice broke on their ears.\\n\\n“You’re getting quite impossible, Sonia!” she cried. “It’s absolutely\\nuseless telling you anything. I told you particularly to pack my\\nleather writing-case in my bag with your own hand. I happen to open a\\ndrawer, and what do I see? My leather writing-case.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry,” said Sonia. “I was going—”\\n\\n“Oh, there’s no need to bother about it. I’ll see after it myself,”\\nsaid Germaine. “But upon my word, you might be one of our guests,\\nseeing how easily you take things. You’re negligence personified.”\\n\\n“Come, Germaine ... a mere oversight,” said the Duke, in a coaxing\\ntone.\\n\\n“Now, excuse me, Jacques; but you’ve got an unfortunate habit of\\ninterfering in household matters. You did it only the other day. I can\\nno longer say a word to a servant—”\\n\\n“Germaine!” said the Duke, in sharp protest.\\n\\nGermaine turned from him to Sonia, and pointed to a packet of envelopes\\nand some letters, which Bernard Charolais had knocked off the table,\\nand said, “Pick up those envelopes and letters, and bring everything to\\nmy room, and be quick about it!”\\n\\nShe flung out of the room, and slammed the door behind her.\\n\\nSonia seemed entirely unmoved by the outburst: no flush of\\nmortification stained her cheeks, her lips did not quiver. She stooped\\nto pick up the fallen papers.\\n\\n“No, no; let me, I beg you,” said the Duke, in a tone of distress. And\\ndropping on one knee, he began to gather together the fallen papers. He\\nset them on the table, and then he said: “You mustn’t mind what\\nGermaine says. She’s—she’s—she’s all right at heart. It’s her manner.\\nShe’s always been happy, and had everything she wanted. She’s been\\nspoiled, don’t you know. Those kind of people never have any\\nconsideration for any one else. You mustn’t let her outburst hurt you.”\\n\\n“Oh, but I don’t. I don’t really,” protested Sonia.\\n\\n“I’m glad of that,” said the Duke. “It isn’t really worth noticing.”\\n\\nHe drew the envelopes and unused cards into a packet, and handed them\\nto her.\\n\\n“There!” he said, with a smile. “That won’t be too heavy for you.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Sonia, taking it from him.\\n\\n“Shall I carry them for you?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No, thank you, your Grace,” said Sonia.\\n\\nWith a quick, careless, almost irresponsible movement, he caught her\\nhand, bent down, and kissed it. A great wave of rosy colour flowed over\\nher face, flooding its whiteness to her hair and throat. She stood for\\na moment turned to stone; she put her hand to her heart. Then on hasty,\\nfaltering feet she went to the door, opened it, paused on the\\nthreshold, turned and looked back at him, and vanished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\nA LETTER FROM LUPIN\\n\\n\\nThe Duke stood for a while staring thoughtfully at the door through\\nwhich Sonia had passed, a faint smile playing round his lips. He\\ncrossed the hall to the Chippendale bureau, took a cigarette from a box\\nwhich stood on the ledge of it, beside the morocco case which held the\\npendant, lighted it, and went slowly out on to the terrace. He crossed\\nit slowly, paused for a moment on the edge of it, and looked across the\\nstretch of country with musing eyes, which saw nothing of its beauty.\\nThen he turned to the right, went down a flight of steps to the lower\\nterrace, crossed the lawn, and took a narrow path which led into the\\nheart of a shrubbery of tall deodoras. In the middle of it he came to\\none of those old stone benches, moss-covered and weather-stained, which\\nadorn the gardens of so many French châteaux. It faced a marble basin\\nfrom which rose the slender column of a pattering fountain. The figure\\nof a Cupid danced joyously on a tall pedestal to the right of the\\nbasin. The Duke sat down on the bench, and was still, with that rare\\nstillness which only comes of nerves in perfect harmony, his brow\\nknitted in careful thought. Now and again the frown cleared from his\\nface, and his intent features relaxed into a faint smile, a smile of\\npleasant memory. Once he rose, walked round the fountains frowning,\\ncame back to the bench, and sat down again. The early September dusk\\nwas upon him when at last he rose and with quick steps took his way\\nthrough the shrubbery, with the air of a man whose mind, for good or\\nill, was at last made up.\\n\\nWhen he came on to the upper terrace his eyes fell on a group which\\nstood at the further corner, near the entrance of the château, and he\\nsauntered slowly up to it.\\n\\nIn the middle of it stood M. Gournay-Martin, a big, round, flabby hulk\\nof a man. He was nearly as red in the face as M. Charolais; and he\\nlooked a great deal redder owing to the extreme whiteness of the\\nwhiskers which stuck out on either side of his vast expanse of cheek.\\nAs he came up, it struck the Duke as rather odd that he should have the\\nCharolais eyes, set close together; any one who did not know that they\\nwere strangers to one another might have thought it a family likeness.\\n\\nThe millionaire was waving his hands and roaring after the manner of a\\nman who has cultivated the art of brow-beating those with whom he does\\nbusiness; and as the Duke neared the group, he caught the words:\\n\\n“No; that’s the lowest I’ll take. Take it or leave it. You can say Yes,\\nor you can say Good-bye; and I don’t care a hang which.”\\n\\n“It’s very dear,” said M. Charolais, in a mournful tone.\\n\\n“Dear!” roared M. Gournay-Martin. “I should like to see any one else\\nsell a hundred horse-power car for eight hundred pounds. Why, my good\\nsir, you’re having me!”\\n\\n“No, no,” protested M. Charolais feebly.\\n\\n“I tell you you’re having me,” roared M. Gournay-Martin. “I’m letting\\nyou have a magnificent car for which I paid thirteen hundred pounds for\\neight hundred! It’s scandalous the way you’ve beaten me down!”\\n\\n“No, no,” protested M. Charolais.\\n\\nHe seemed frightened out of his life by the vehemence of the big man.\\n\\n“You wait till you’ve seen how it goes,” said M. Gournay-Martin.\\n\\n“Eight hundred is very dear,” said M. Charolais.\\n\\n“Come, come! You’re too sharp, that’s what you are. But don’t say any\\nmore till you’ve tried the car.”\\n\\nHe turned to his chauffeur, who stood by watching the struggle with an\\nappreciative grin on his brown face, and said: “Now, Jean, take these\\ngentlemen to the garage, and run them down to the station. Show them\\nwhat the car can do. Do whatever they ask you—everything.”\\n\\nHe winked at Jean, turned again to M. Charolais, and said: “You know,\\nM. Charolais, you’re too good a man of business for me. You’re hot\\nstuff, that’s what you are—hot stuff. You go along and try the car.\\nGood-bye—good-bye.”\\n\\nThe four Charolais murmured good-bye in deep depression, and went off\\nwith Jean, wearing something of the air of whipped dogs. When they had\\ngone round the corner the millionaire turned to the Duke and said, with\\na chuckle: “He’ll buy the car all right—had him fine!”\\n\\n“No business success of yours could surprise me,” said the Duke\\nblandly, with a faint, ironical smile.\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin’s little pig’s eyes danced and sparkled; and the\\nsmiles flowed over the distended skin of his face like little ripples\\nover a stagnant pool, reluctantly. It seemed to be too tightly\\nstretched for smiles.\\n\\n“The car’s four years old,” he said joyfully. “He’ll give me eight\\nhundred for it, and it’s not worth a pipe of tobacco. And eight hundred\\npounds is just the price of a little Watteau I’ve had my eye on for\\nsome time—a first-class investment.”\\n\\nThey strolled down the terrace, and through one of the windows into the\\nhall. Firmin had lighted the lamps, two of them. They made but a small\\noasis of light in a desert of dim hall. The millionaire let himself\\ndown very gingerly into an Empire chair, as if he feared, with\\nexcellent reason, that it might collapse under his weight.\\n\\n“Well, my dear Duke,” he said, “you don’t ask me the result of my\\nofficial lunch or what the minister said.”\\n\\n“Is there any news?” said the Duke carelessly.\\n\\n“Yes. The decree will be signed to-morrow. You can consider yourself\\ndecorated. I hope you feel a happy man,” said the millionaire, rubbing\\nhis fat hands together with prodigious satisfaction.\\n\\n“Oh, charmed—charmed,” said the Duke, with entire indifference.\\n\\n“As for me, I’m delighted—delighted,” said the millionaire. “I was\\nextremely keen on your being decorated. After that, and after a volume\\nor two of travels, and after you’ve published your grandfather’s\\nletters with a good introduction, you can begin to think of the\\nAcademy.”\\n\\n“The Academy!” said the Duke, startled from his usual coolness. “But\\nI’ve no title to become an Academician.”\\n\\n“How, no title?” said the millionaire solemnly; and his little eyes\\nopened wide. “You’re a duke.”\\n\\n“There’s no doubt about that,” said the Duke, watching him with\\nadmiring curiosity.\\n\\n“I mean to marry my daughter to a worker—a worker, my dear Duke,” said\\nthe millionaire, slapping his big left hand with his bigger right.\\n“I’ve no prejudices—not I. I wish to have for son-in-law a duke who\\nwears the Order of the Legion of Honour, and belongs to the Academie\\nFrançaise, because that is personal merit. I’m no snob.”\\n\\nA gentle, irrepressible laugh broke from the Duke.\\n\\n“What are you laughing at?” said the millionaire, and a sudden lowering\\ngloom overspread his beaming face.\\n\\n“Nothing—nothing,” said the Duke quietly. “Only you’re so full of\\nsurprises.”\\n\\n“I’ve startled you, have I? I thought I should. It’s true that I’m full\\nof surprises. It’s my knowledge. I understand so much. I understand\\nbusiness, and I love art, pictures, a good bargain, bric-a-brac, fine\\ntapestry. They’re first-class investments. Yes, certainly I do love the\\nbeautiful. And I don’t want to boast, but I understand it. I have\\ntaste, and I’ve something better than taste; I have a flair, the\\ndealer’s flair.”\\n\\n“Yes, your collections, especially your collection in Paris, prove it,”\\nsaid the Duke, stifling a yawn.\\n\\n“And yet you haven’t seen the finest thing I have—the coronet of the\\nPrincesse de Lamballe. It’s worth half a million francs.”\\n\\n“So I’ve heard,” said the Duke, a little wearily. “I don’t wonder that\\nArsène Lupin envied you it.”\\n\\nThe Empire chair creaked as the millionaire jumped.\\n\\n“Don’t speak of the swine!” he roared. “Don’t mention his name before\\nme.”\\n\\n“Germaine showed me his letter,” said the Duke. “It is amusing.”\\n\\n“His letter! The blackguard! I just missed a fit of apoplexy from it,”\\nroared the millionaire. “I was in this very hall where we are now,\\nchatting quietly, when all at once in comes Firmin, and hands me a\\nletter.”\\n\\nHe was interrupted by the opening of the door. Firmin came clumping\\ndown the room, and said in his deep voice, “A letter for you, sir.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said the millionaire, taking the letter, and, as he fitted\\nhis eye-glass into his eye, he went on, “Yes, Firmin brought me a\\nletter of which the handwriting,”—he raised the envelope he was holding\\nto his eyes, and bellowed, “Good heavens!”\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said the Duke, jumping in his chair at the sudden,\\nstartling burst of sound.\\n\\n“The handwriting!—the handwriting!—it’s THE SAME HANDWRITING!” gasped\\nthe millionaire. And he let himself fall heavily backwards against the\\nback of his chair.\\n\\nThere was a crash. The Duke had a vision of huge arms and legs waving\\nin the air as the chair-back gave. There was another crash. The chair\\ncollapsed. The huge bulk banged to the floor.\\n\\nThe laughter of the Duke rang out uncontrollably. He caught one of the\\nwaving arms, and jerked the flabby giant to his feet with an ease which\\nseemed to show that his muscles were of steel.\\n\\n“Come,” he said, laughing still. “This is nonsense! What do you mean by\\nthe same handwriting? It can’t be.”\\n\\n“It is the same handwriting. Am I likely to make a mistake about it?”\\nspluttered the millionaire. And he tore open the envelope with an air\\nof frenzy.\\n\\nHe ran his eyes over it, and they grew larger and larger—they grew\\nalmost of an average size.\\n\\n“Listen,” he said “listen:”\\n\\n“DEAR SIR,”\\n\\n\\n“My collection of pictures, which I had the pleasure of starting three\\nyears ago with some of your own, only contains, as far as Old Masters\\ngo, one Velasquez, one Rembrandt, and three paltry Rubens. You have a\\ngreat many more. Since it is a shame such masterpieces should be in\\nyour hands, I propose to appropriate them; and I shall set about a\\nrespectful acquisition of them in your Paris house tomorrow morning.”\\n\\n\\n“Yours very sincerely,”\\n“ARSÈNE LUPIN.”\\n\\n\\n“He’s humbugging,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Wait! wait!” gasped the millionaire. “There’s a postscript. Listen:”\\n\\n“P.S.—You must understand that since you have been keeping the coronet\\nof the Princesse de Lamballe during these three years, I shall avail\\nmyself of the same occasion to compel you to restore that piece of\\njewellery to me.—A. L.”\\n\\n\\n“The thief! The scoundrel! I’m choking!” gasped the millionaire,\\nclutching at his collar.\\n\\nTo judge from the blackness of his face, and the way he staggered and\\ndropped on to a couch, which was fortunately stronger than the chair,\\nhe was speaking the truth.\\n\\n“Firmin! Firmin!” shouted the Duke. “A glass of water! Quick! Your\\nmaster’s ill.”\\n\\nHe rushed to the side of the millionaire, who gasped: “Telephone!\\nTelephone to the Prefecture of Police! Be quick!”\\n\\nThe Duke loosened his collar with deft fingers; tore a Van Loo fan from\\nits case hanging on the wall, and fanned him furiously. Firmin came\\nclumping into the room with a glass of water in his hand.\\n\\nThe drawing-room door opened, and Germaine and Sonia, alarmed by the\\nDuke’s shout, hurried in.\\n\\n“Quick! Your smelling-salts!” said the Duke.\\n\\nSonia ran across the hall, opened one of the drawers in the Oriental\\ncabinet, and ran to the millionaire with a large bottle of\\nsmelling-salts in her hand. The Duke took it from her, and applied it\\nto the millionaire’s nose. The millionaire sneezed thrice with terrific\\nviolence. The Duke snatched the glass from Firmin and dashed the water\\ninto his host’s purple face. The millionaire gasped and spluttered.\\n\\nGermaine stood staring helplessly at her gasping sire.\\n\\n“Whatever’s the matter?” she said.\\n\\n“It’s this letter,” said the Duke. “A letter from Lupin.”\\n\\n“I told you so—I said that Lupin was in the neighbourhood,” cried\\nGermaine triumphantly.\\n\\n“Firmin—where’s Firmin?” said the millionaire, dragging himself\\nupright. He seemed to have recovered a great deal of his voice. “Oh,\\nthere you are!”\\n\\nHe jumped up, caught the gamekeeper by the shoulder, and shook him\\nfuriously.\\n\\n“This letter. Where did it come from? Who brought it?” he roared.\\n\\n“It was in the letter-box—the letter-box of the lodge at the bottom of\\nthe park. My wife found it there,” said Firmin, and he twisted out of\\nthe millionaire’s grasp.\\n\\n“Just as it was three years ago,” roared the millionaire, with an air\\nof desperation. “It’s exactly the same coup. Oh, what a catastrophe!\\nWhat a catastrophe!”\\n\\nHe made as if to tear out his hair; then, remembering its scantiness,\\nrefrained.\\n\\n“Now, come, it’s no use losing your head,” said the Duke, with quiet\\nfirmness. “If this letter isn’t a hoax—”\\n\\n“Hoax?” bellowed the millionaire. “Was it a hoax three years ago?”\\n\\n“Very good,” said the Duke. “But if this robbery with which you’re\\nthreatened is genuine, it’s just childish.”\\n\\n“How?” said the millionaire.\\n\\n“Look at the date of the letter—Sunday, September the third. This\\nletter was written to-day.”\\n\\n“Yes. Well, what of it?” said the millionaire.\\n\\n“Look at the letter: ‘I shall set about a respectful acquisition of\\nthem in your Paris house to-morrow morning’—to-morrow morning.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes; ‘to-morrow morning’—what of it?” said the millionaire.\\n\\n“One of two things,” said the Duke. “Either it’s a hoax, and we needn’t\\nbother about it; or the threat is genuine, and we have the time to stop\\nthe robbery.”\\n\\n“Of course we have. Whatever was I thinking of?” said the millionaire.\\nAnd his anguish cleared from his face.\\n\\n“For once in a way our dear Lupin’s fondness for warning people will\\nhave given him a painful jar,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Come on! let me get at the telephone,” cried the millionaire.\\n\\n“But the telephone’s no good,” said Sonia quickly.\\n\\n“No good! Why?” roared the millionaire, dashing heavily across the room\\nto it.\\n\\n“Look at the time,” said Sonia; “the telephone doesn’t work as late as\\nthis. It’s Sunday.”\\n\\nThe millionaire stopped dead.\\n\\n“It’s true. It’s appalling,” he groaned.\\n\\n“But that doesn’t matter. You can always telegraph,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“But you can’t. It’s impossible,” said Sonia. “You can’t get a message\\nthrough. It’s Sunday; and the telegraph offices shut at twelve\\no’clock.”\\n\\n“Oh, what a Government!” groaned the millionaire. And he sank down\\ngently on a chair beside the telephone, and mopped the beads of anguish\\nfrom his brow. They looked at him, and they looked at one another,\\ncudgelling their brains for yet another way of communicating with the\\nParis police.\\n\\n“Hang it all!” said the Duke. “There must be some way out of the\\ndifficulty.”\\n\\n“What way?” said the millionaire.\\n\\nThe Duke did not answer. He put his hands in his pockets and walked\\nimpatiently up and down the hall. Germaine sat down on a chair. Sonia\\nput her hands on the back of a couch, and leaned forward, watching him.\\nFirmin stood by the door, whither he had retired to be out of the reach\\nof his excited master, with a look of perplexity on his stolid face.\\nThey all watched the Duke with the air of people waiting for an oracle\\nto deliver its message. The millionaire kept mopping the beads of\\nanguish from his brow. The more he thought of his impending loss, the\\nmore freely he perspired. Germaine’s maid, Irma, came to the door\\nleading into the outer hall, which Firmin, according to his usual\\ncustom, had left open, and peered in wonder at the silent group.\\n\\n“I have it!” cried the Duke at last. “There is a way out.”\\n\\n“What is it?” said the millionaire, rising and coming to the middle of\\nthe hall.\\n\\n“What time is it?” said the Duke, pulling out his watch.\\n\\nThe millionaire pulled out his watch. Germaine pulled out hers. Firmin,\\nafter a struggle, produced from some pocket difficult of access an\\nobject not unlike a silver turnip. There was a brisk dispute between\\nGermaine and the millionaire about which of their watches was right.\\nFirmin, whose watch apparently did not agree with the watch of either\\nof them, made his deep voice heard above theirs. The Duke came to the\\nconclusion that it must be a few minutes past seven.\\n\\n“It’s seven or a few minutes past,” he said sharply. “Well, I’m going\\nto take a car and hurry off to Paris. I ought to get there, bar\\naccidents, between two and three in the morning, just in time to inform\\nthe police and catch the burglars in the very midst of their burglary.\\nI’ll just get a few things together.”\\n\\nSo saying, he rushed out of the hall.\\n\\n“Excellent! excellent!” said the millionaire. “Your young man is a man\\nof resource, Germaine. It seems almost a pity that he’s a duke. He’d do\\nwonders in the building trade. But I’m going to Paris too, and you’re\\ncoming with me. I couldn’t wait idly here, to save my life. And I can’t\\nleave you here, either. This scoundrel may be going to make a\\nsimultaneous attempt on the château—not that there’s much here that I\\nreally value. There’s that statuette that moved, and the pane cut out\\nof the window. I can’t leave you two girls with burglars in the house.\\nAfter all, there’s the sixty horse-power and the thirty horse-power\\ncar—there’ll be lots of room for all of us.”\\n\\n“Oh, but it’s nonsense, papa; we shall get there before the servants,”\\nsaid Germaine pettishly. “Think of arriving at an empty house in the\\ndead of night.”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” said the millionaire. “Hurry off and get ready. Your bag\\nought to be packed. Where are my keys? Sonia, where are my keys—the\\nkeys of the Paris house?”\\n\\n“They’re in the bureau,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Well, see that I don’t go without them. Now hurry up. Firmin, go and\\ntell Jean that we shall want both cars. I will drive one, the Duke the\\nother. Jean must stay with you and help guard the château.”\\n\\nSo saying he bustled out of the hall, driving the two girls before him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\nAGAIN THE CHAROLAIS\\n\\n\\nHardly had the door closed behind the millionaire when the head of M.\\nCharolais appeared at one of the windows opening on to the terrace. He\\nlooked round the empty hall, whistled softly, and stepped inside.\\nInside of ten seconds his three sons came in through the windows, and\\nwith them came Jean, the millionaire’s chauffeur.\\n\\n“Take the door into the outer hall, Jean,” said M. Charolais, in a low\\nvoice. “Bernard, take that door into the drawing-room. Pierre and\\nLouis, help me go through the drawers. The whole family is going to\\nParis, and if we’re not quick we shan’t get the cars.”\\n\\n“That comes of this silly fondness for warning people of a coup,”\\ngrowled Jean, as he hurried to the door of the outer hall. “It would\\nhave been so simple to rob the Paris house without sending that\\ninfernal letter. It was sure to knock them all silly.”\\n\\n“What harm can the letter do, you fool?” said M. Charolais. “It’s\\nSunday. We want them knocked silly for to-morrow, to get hold of the\\ncoronet. Oh, to get hold of that coronet! It must be in Paris. I’ve\\nbeen ransacking this château for hours.”\\n\\nJean opened the door of the outer hall half an inch, and glued his eyes\\nto it. Bernard had done the same with the door opening into the\\ndrawing-room. M. Charolais, Pierre, and Louis were opening drawers,\\nransacking them, and shutting them with infinite quickness and\\nnoiselessly.\\n\\n“Bureau! Which is the bureau? The place is stuffed with bureaux!”\\ngrowled M. Charolais. “I must have those keys.”\\n\\n“That plain thing with the brass handles in the middle on the\\nleft—that’s a bureau,” said Bernard softly.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you say so?” growled M. Charolais.\\n\\nHe dashed to it, and tried it. It was locked.\\n\\n“Locked, of course! Just my luck! Come and get it open, Pierre. Be\\nsmart!”\\n\\nThe son he had described as an engineer came quickly to the bureau,\\nfitting together as he came the two halves of a small jemmy. He fitted\\nit into the top of the flap. There was a crunch, and the old lock gave.\\nHe opened the flap, and he and M. Charolais pulled open drawer after\\ndrawer.\\n\\n“Quick! Here’s that fat old fool!” said Jean, in a hoarse, hissing\\nwhisper.\\n\\nHe moved down the hall, blowing out one of the lamps as he passed it.\\nIn the seventh drawer lay a bunch of keys. M. Charolais snatched it up,\\nglanced at it, took a bunch of keys from his own pocket, put it in the\\ndrawer, closed it, closed the flap, and rushed to the window. Jean and\\nhis sons were already out on the terrace.\\n\\nM. Charolais was still a yard from the window when the door into the\\nouter hall opened and in came M. Gournay-Martin.\\n\\nHe caught a glimpse of a back vanishing through the window, and\\nbellowed: “Hi! A man! A burglar! Firmin! Firmin!”\\n\\nHe ran blundering down the hall, tangled his feet in the fragments of\\nthe broken chair, and came sprawling a thundering cropper, which\\nknocked every breath of wind out of his capacious body. He lay flat on\\nhis face for a couple of minutes, his broad back wriggling\\nconvulsively—a pathetic sight!—in the painful effort to get his breath\\nback. Then he sat up, and with perfect frankness burst into tears. He\\nsobbed and blubbered, like a small child that has hurt itself, for\\nthree or four minutes. Then, having recovered his magnificent voice, he\\nbellowed furiously: “Firmin! Firmin! Charmerace! Charmerace!”\\n\\nThen he rose painfully to his feet, and stood staring at the open\\nwindows.\\n\\nPresently he roared again: “Firmin! Firmin! Charmerace! Charmerace!”\\n\\nHe kept looking at the window with terrified eyes, as though he\\nexpected somebody to step in and cut his throat from ear to ear.\\n\\n“Firmin! Firmin! Charmerace! Charmerace!” he bellowed again.\\n\\nThe Duke came quietly into the hall, dressed in a heavy motor-coat, his\\nmotor-cap on his head, and carrying a kit-bag in his hand.\\n\\n“Did I hear you call?” he said.\\n\\n“Call?” said the millionaire. “I shouted. The burglars are here\\nalready. I’ve just seen one of them. He was bolting through the middle\\nwindow.”\\n\\nThe Duke raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n“Nerves,” he said gently—“nerves.”\\n\\n“Nerves be hanged!” said the millionaire. “I tell you I saw him as\\nplainly as I see you.”\\n\\n“Well, you can’t see me at all, seeing that you’re lighting an acre and\\na half of hall with a single lamp,” said the Duke, still in a tone of\\nutter incredulity.\\n\\n“It’s that fool Firmin! He ought to have lighted six. Firmin! Firmin!”\\nbellowed the millionaire.\\n\\nThey listened for the sonorous clumping of the promoted gamekeeper’s\\nboots, but they did not hear it. Evidently Firmin was still giving his\\nmaster’s instructions about the cars to Jean.\\n\\n“Well, we may as well shut the windows, anyhow,” said the Duke,\\nproceeding to do so. “If you think Firmin would be any good, you might\\npost him in this hall with a gun to-night. There could be no harm in\\nputting a charge of small shot into the legs of these ruffians. He has\\nonly to get one of them, and the others will go for their lives. Yet I\\ndon’t like leaving you and Germaine in this big house with only Firmin\\nto look after you.”\\n\\n“I shouldn’t like it myself, and I’m not going to chance it,” growled\\nthe millionaire. “We’re going to motor to Paris along with you, and\\nleave Jean to help Firmin fight these burglars. Firmin’s all right—he’s\\nan old soldier. He fought in ’70. Not that I’ve much belief in soldiers\\nagainst this cursed Lupin, after the way he dealt with that corporal\\nand his men three years ago.”\\n\\n“I’m glad you’re coming to Paris,” said the Duke. “It’ll be a weight\\noff my mind. I’d better drive the limousine, and you take the\\nlandaulet.”\\n\\n“That won’t do,” said the millionaire. “Germaine won’t go in the\\nlimousine. You know she has taken a dislike to it.”\\n\\n“Nevertheless, I’d better bucket on to Paris, and let you follow slowly\\nwith Germaine. The sooner I get to Paris the better for your\\ncollection. I’ll take Mademoiselle Kritchnoff with me, and, if you\\nlike, Irma, though the lighter I travel the sooner I shall get there.”\\n\\n“No, I’ll take Irma and Germaine,” said the millionaire. “Germaine\\nwould prefer to have Irma with her, in case you had an accident. She\\nwouldn’t like to get to Paris and have to find a fresh maid.”\\n\\nThe drawing-room door opened, and in came Germaine, followed by Sonia\\nand Irma. They wore motor-cloaks and hoods and veils. Sonia and Irma\\nwere carrying hand-bags.\\n\\n“I think it’s extremely tiresome your dragging us off to Paris like\\nthis in the middle of the night,” said Germaine pettishly.\\n\\n“Do you?” said the millionaire. “Well, then, you’ll be interested to\\nhear that I’ve just seen a burglar here in this very room. I frightened\\nhim, and he bolted through the window on to the terrace.”\\n\\n“He was greenish-pink, slightly tinged with yellow,” said the Duke\\nsoftly.\\n\\n“Greenish-pink? Oh, do stop your jesting, Jacques! Is this a time for\\nidiocy?” cried Germaine, in a tone of acute exasperation.\\n\\n“It was the dim light which made your father see him in those colours.\\nIn a bright light, I think he would have been an Alsatian blue,” said\\nthe Duke suavely.\\n\\n“You’ll have to break yourself of this silly habit of trifling, my dear\\nDuke, if ever you expect to be a member of the Academie Française,”\\nsaid the millionaire with some acrimony. “I tell you I did see a\\nburglar.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes. I admitted it frankly. It was his colour I was talking\\nabout,” said the Duke, with an ironical smile.\\n\\n“Oh, stop your idiotic jokes! We’re all sick to death of them!” said\\nGermaine, with something of the fine fury which so often distinguished\\nher father.\\n\\n“There are times for all things,” said the millionaire solemnly. “And I\\nmust say that, with the fate of my collection and of the coronet\\ntrembling in the balance, this does not seem to me a season for idle\\njests.”\\n\\n“I stand reproved,” said the Duke; and he smiled at Sonia.\\n\\n“My keys, Sonia—the keys of the Paris house,” said the millionaire.\\n\\nSonia took her own keys from her pocket and went to the bureau. She\\nslipped a key into the lock and tried to turn it. It would not turn;\\nand she bent down to look at it.\\n\\n“Why—why, some one’s been tampering with the lock! It’s broken!” she\\ncried.\\n\\n“I told you I’d seen a burglar!” cried the millionaire triumphantly.\\n“He was after the keys.”\\n\\nSonia drew back the flap of the bureau and hastily pulled open the\\ndrawer in which the keys had been.\\n\\n“They’re here!” she cried, taking them out of the drawer and holding\\nthem up.\\n\\n“Then I was just in time,” said the millionaire. “I startled him in the\\nvery act of stealing the keys.”\\n\\n“I withdraw! I withdraw!” said the Duke. “You did see a burglar,\\nevidently. But still I believe he was greenish-pink. They often are.\\nHowever, you’d better give me those keys, Mademoiselle Sonia, since I’m\\nto get to Paris first. I should look rather silly if, when I got there,\\nI had to break into the house to catch the burglars.”\\n\\nSonia handed the keys to the Duke. He contrived to take her little\\nhand, keys and all, into his own, as he received them, and squeezed it.\\nThe light was too dim for the others to see the flush which flamed in\\nher face. She went back and stood beside the bureau.\\n\\n“Now, papa, are you going to motor to Paris in a thin coat and linen\\nwaistcoat? If we’re going, we’d better go. You always do keep us\\nwaiting half an hour whenever we start to go anywhere,” said Germaine\\nfirmly.\\n\\nThe millionaire bustled out of the room. With a gesture of impatience\\nGermaine dropped into a chair. Irma stood waiting by the drawing-room\\ndoor. Sonia sat down by the bureau.\\n\\nThere came a sharp patter of rain against the windows.\\n\\n“Rain! It only wanted that! It’s going to be perfectly beastly!” cried\\nGermaine.\\n\\n“Oh, well, you must make the best of it. At any rate you’re well\\nwrapped up, and the night is warm enough, though it is raining,” said\\nthe Duke. “Still, I could have wished that Lupin confined his\\noperations to fine weather.” He paused, and added cheerfully, “But,\\nafter all, it will lay the dust.”\\n\\nThey sat for three or four minutes in a dull silence, listening to the\\npattering of the rain against the panes. The Duke took his\\ncigarette-case from his pocket and lighted a cigarette.\\n\\nSuddenly he lost his bored air; his face lighted up; and he said\\njoyfully: “Of course, why didn’t I think of it? Why should we start\\nfrom a pit of gloom like this? Let us have the proper illumination\\nwhich our enterprise deserves.”\\n\\nWith that he set about lighting all the lamps in the hall. There were\\nlamps on stands, lamps on brackets, lamps on tables, and lamps which\\nhung from the roof—old-fashioned lamps with new reservoirs, new lamps\\nof what is called chaste design, brass lamps, silver lamps, and lamps\\nin porcelain. The Duke lighted them one after another, patiently,\\nmissing none, with a cold perseverance. The operation was punctuated by\\nexclamations from Germaine. They were all to the effect that she could\\nnot understand how he could be such a fool. The Duke paid no attention\\nwhatever to her. His face illumined with boyish glee, he lighted lamp\\nafter lamp.\\n\\nSonia watched him with a smiling admiration of the childlike enthusiasm\\nwith which he performed the task. Even the stolid face of the ox-eyed\\nIrma relaxed into grins, which she smoothed quickly out with a\\nrespectful hand.\\n\\nThe Duke had just lighted the twenty-second lamp when in bustled the\\nmillionaire.\\n\\n“What’s this? What’s this?” he cried, stopping short, blinking.\\n\\n“Just some more of Jacques’ foolery!” cried Germaine in tones of the\\nlast exasperation.\\n\\n“But, my dear Duke!—my dear Duke! The oil!—the oil!” cried the\\nmillionaire, in a tone of bitter distress. “Do you think it’s my object\\nin life to swell the Rockefeller millions? We never have more than six\\nlamps burning unless we are holding a reception.”\\n\\n“I think it looks so cheerful,” said the Duke, looking round on his\\nhandiwork with a beaming smile of satisfaction. “But where are the\\ncars? Jean seems a deuce of a time bringing them round. Does he expect\\nus to go to the garage through this rain? We’d better hurry him up.\\nCome on; you’ve got a good carrying voice.”\\n\\nHe caught the millionaire by the arm, hurried him through the outer\\nhall, opened the big door of the château, and said: “Now shout!”\\n\\nThe millionaire looked at him, shrugged his shoulders, and said: “You\\ndon’t beat about the bush when you want anything.”\\n\\n“Why should I?” said the Duke simply. “Shout, my good chap—shout!”\\n\\nThe millionaire raised his voice in a terrific bellow of “Jean! Jean!\\nFirmin! Firmin!”\\n\\nThere was no answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\nTHE THEFT OF THE MOTOR-CARS\\n\\n\\nThe night was very black; the rain pattered in their faces.\\n\\nAgain the millionaire bellowed: “Jean! Firmin! Firmin! Jean!”\\n\\nNo answer came out of the darkness, though his bellow echoed and\\nre-echoed among the out-buildings and stables away on the left.\\n\\nHe turned and looked at the Duke and said uneasily, “What on earth can\\nthey be doing?”\\n\\n“I can’t conceive,” said the Duke. “I suppose we must go and hunt them\\nout.”\\n\\n“What! in this darkness, with these burglars about?” said the\\nmillionaire, starting back.\\n\\n“If we don’t, nobody else will,” said the Duke. “And all the time that\\nrascal Lupin is stealing nearer and nearer your pictures. So buck up,\\nand come along!”\\n\\nHe seized the reluctant millionaire by the arm and drew him down the\\nsteps. They took their way to the stables. A dim light shone from the\\nopen door of the motor-house. The Duke went into it first, and stopped\\nshort.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll be hanged!” he cried,\\n\\nInstead of three cars the motor-house held but one—the hundred\\nhorse-power Mercrac. It was a racing car, with only two seats. On them\\nsat two figures, Jean and Firmin.\\n\\n“What are you sitting there for? You idle dogs!” bellowed the\\nmillionaire.\\n\\nNeither of the men answered, nor did they stir. The light from the lamp\\ngleamed on their fixed eyes, which stared at their infuriated master.\\n\\n“What on earth is this?” said the Duke; and seizing the lamp which\\nstood beside the car, he raised it so that its light fell on the two\\nfigures. Then it was clear what had happened: they were trussed like\\ntwo fowls, and gagged.\\n\\nThe Duke pulled a penknife from his pocket, opened the blade, stepped\\ninto the car and set Firmin free. Firmin coughed and spat and swore.\\nThe Duke cut the bonds of Jean.\\n\\n“Well,” said the Duke, in a tone of cutting irony, “what new game is\\nthis? What have you been playing at?”\\n\\n“It was those Charolais—those cursed Charolais!” growled Firmin.\\n\\n“They came on us unawares from behind,” said Jean.\\n\\n“They tied us up, and gagged us—the swine!” said Firmin.\\n\\n“And then—they went off in the two cars,” said Jean.\\n\\n“Went off in the two cars?” cried the millionaire, in blank\\nstupefaction.\\n\\nThe Duke burst into a shout of laughter.\\n\\n“Well, your dear friend Lupin doesn’t do things by halves,” he cried.\\n“This is the funniest thing I ever heard of.”\\n\\n“Funny!” howled the millionaire. “Funny! Where does the fun come in?\\nWhat about my pictures and the coronet?”\\n\\nThe Duke laughed his laugh out; then changed on the instant to a man of\\naction.\\n\\n“Well, this means a change in our plans,” he said. “I must get to Paris\\nin this car here.”\\n\\n“It’s such a rotten old thing,” said the millionaire. “You’ll never do\\nit.”\\n\\n“Never mind,” said the Duke. “I’ve got to do it somehow. I daresay it’s\\nbetter than you think. And after all, it’s only a matter of two hundred\\nmiles.” He paused, and then said in an anxious tone: “All the same I\\ndon’t like leaving you and Germaine in the château. These rogues have\\nprobably only taken the cars out of reach just to prevent your getting\\nto Paris. They’ll leave them in some field and come back.”\\n\\n“You’re not going to leave us behind. I wouldn’t spend the night in the\\nchâteau for a million francs. There’s always the train,” said the\\nmillionaire.\\n\\n“The train! Twelve hours in the train—with all those changes! You don’t\\nmean that you will actually go to Paris by train?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“I do,” said the millionaire. “Come along—I must go and tell Germaine;\\nthere’s no time to waste,” and he hurried off to the château.\\n\\n“Get the lamps lighted, Jean, and make sure that the tank’s full. As\\nfor the engine, I must humour it and trust to luck. I’ll get her to\\nParis somehow,” said the Duke.\\n\\nHe went back to the château, and Firmin followed him.\\n\\nWhen the Duke came into the great hall he found Germaine and her father\\nindulging in recriminations. She was declaring that nothing would\\ninduce her to make the journey by train; her father was declaring that\\nshe should. He bore down her opposition by the mere force of his\\nmagnificent voice.\\n\\nWhen at last there came a silence, Sonia said quietly: “But is there a\\ntrain? I know there’s a train at midnight; but is there one before?”\\n\\n“A time-table—where’s a time-table?” said the millionaire.\\n\\n“Now, where did I see a time-table?” said the Duke. “Oh, I know;\\nthere’s one in the drawer of that Oriental cabinet.” Crossing to the\\ncabinet, he opened the drawer, took out the time-table, and handed it\\nto M. Gournay-Martin.\\n\\nThe millionaire took it and turned over the leaves quickly, ran his eye\\ndown a page, and said, “Yes, thank goodness, there is a train. There’s\\none at a quarter to nine.”\\n\\n“And what good is it to us? How are we to get to the station?” said\\nGermaine.\\n\\nThey looked at one another blankly. Firmin, who had followed the Duke\\ninto the hall, came to the rescue.\\n\\n“There’s the luggage-cart,” he said.\\n\\n“The luggage-cart!” cried Germaine contemptuously.\\n\\n“The very thing!” said the millionaire. “I’ll drive it myself. Off you\\ngo, Firmin; harness a horse to it.”\\n\\nFirmin went clumping out of the hall.\\n\\nIt was perhaps as well that he went, for the Duke asked what time it\\nwas; and since the watches of Germaine and her father differed still,\\nthere ensued an altercation in which, had Firmin been there, he would\\ndoubtless have taken part.\\n\\nThe Duke cut it short by saying: “Well, I don’t think I’ll wait to see\\nyou start for the station. It won’t take you more than half an hour.\\nThe cart is light. You needn’t start yet. I’d better get off as soon as\\nthe car is ready. It isn’t as though I could trust it.”\\n\\n“One moment,” said Germaine. “Is there a dining-car on the train? I’m\\nnot going to be starved as well as have my night’s rest cut to pieces.”\\n\\n“Of course there isn’t a dining-car,” snapped her father. “We must eat\\nsomething now, and take something with us.”\\n\\n“Sonia, Irma, quick! Be off to the larder and see what you can find.\\nTell Mother Firmin to make an omelette. Be quick!”\\n\\nSonia went towards the door of the hall, followed by Irma.\\n\\n“Good-night, and bon voyage, Mademoiselle Sonia,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Good-night, and bon voyage, your Grace,” said Sonia.\\n\\nThe Duke opened the door of the hall for her; and as she went out, she\\nsaid anxiously, in a low voice: “Oh, do—do be careful. I hate to think\\nof your hurrying to Paris on a night like this. Please be careful.”\\n\\n“I will be careful,” said the Duke.\\n\\nThe honk of the motor-horn told him that Jean had brought the car to\\nthe door of the château. He came down the room, kissed Germaine’s\\nhands, shook hands with the millionaire, and bade them good-night. Then\\nhe went out to the car. They heard it start; the rattle of it grew\\nfainter and fainter down the long avenue and died away.\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin arose, and began putting out lamps. As he did so, he\\nkept casting fearful glances at the window, as if he feared lest, now\\nthat the Duke had gone, the burglars should dash in upon him.\\n\\nThere came a knock at the door, and Jean appeared on the threshold.\\n\\n“His Grace told me that I was to come into the house, and help Firmin\\nlook after it,” he said.\\n\\nThe millionaire gave him instructions about the guarding of the house.\\nFirmin, since he was an old soldier, was to occupy the post of honour,\\nand guard the hall, armed with his gun. Jean was to guard the two\\ndrawing-rooms, as being less likely points of attack. He also was to\\nhave a gun; and the millionaire went with him to the gun-room and gave\\nhim one and a dozen cartridges. When they came back to the hall, Sonia\\ncalled them into the dining-room; and there, to the accompaniment of an\\nunsubdued grumbling from Germaine at having to eat cold food at eight\\nat night, they made a hasty but excellent meal, since the chef had left\\nan elaborate cold supper ready to be served.\\n\\nThey had nearly finished it when Jean came in, his gun on his arm, to\\nsay that Firmin had harnessed the horse to the luggage-cart, and it was\\nawaiting them at the door of the château.\\n\\n“Send him in to me, and stand by the horse till we come out,” said the\\nmillionaire.\\n\\nFirmin came clumping in.\\n\\nThe millionaire gazed at him solemnly, and said: “Firmin, I am relying\\non you. I am leaving you in a position of honour and danger—a position\\nwhich an old soldier of France loves.”\\n\\nFirmin did his best to look like an old soldier of France. He pulled\\nhimself up out of the slouch which long years of loafing through woods\\nwith a gun on his arm had given him. He lacked also the old soldier of\\nFrance’s fiery gaze. His eyes were lack-lustre.\\n\\n“I look for anything, Firmin—burglary, violence, an armed assault,”\\nsaid the millionaire.\\n\\n“Don’t be afraid, sir. I saw the war of ’70,” said Firmin boldly,\\nrising to the occasion.\\n\\n“Good!” said the millionaire. “I confide the château to you. I trust\\nyou with my treasures.”\\n\\nHe rose, and saying “Come along, we must be getting to the station,” he\\nled the way to the door of the château.\\n\\nThe luggage-cart stood rather high, and they had to bring a chair out\\nof the hall to enable the girls to climb into it. Germaine did not\\nforget to give her real opinion of the advantages of a seat formed by a\\nplank resting on the sides of the cart. The millionaire climbed heavily\\nup in front, and took the reins.\\n\\n“Never again will I trust only to motor-cars. The first thing I’ll do\\nafter I’ve made sure that my collections are safe will be to buy\\ncarriages—something roomy,” he said gloomily, as he realized the\\ndiscomfort of his seat.\\n\\nHe turned to Jean and Firmin, who stood on the steps of the château\\nwatching the departure of their master, and said: “Sons of France, be\\nbrave—be brave!”\\n\\nThe cart bumped off into the damp, dark night.\\n\\nJean and Firmin watched it disappear into the darkness. Then they came\\ninto the château and shut the door.\\n\\nFirmin looked at Jean, and said gloomily: “I don’t like this. These\\nburglars stick at nothing. They’d as soon cut your throat as look at\\nyou.”\\n\\n“It can’t be helped,” said Jean. “Besides, you’ve got the post of\\nhonour. You guard the hall. I’m to look after the drawing-rooms.\\nThey’re not likely to break in through the drawing-rooms. And I shall\\nlock the door between them and the hall.”\\n\\n“No, no; you won’t lock that door!” cried Firmin.\\n\\n“But I certainly will,” said Jean. “You’d better come and get a gun.”\\n\\nThey went to the gun-room, Firmin still protesting against the locking\\nof the door between the drawing-rooms and the hall. He chose his gun;\\nand they went into the kitchen. Jean took two bottles of wine, a\\nrich-looking pie, a sweet, and carried them to the drawing-room. He\\ncame back into the hall, gathered together an armful of papers and\\nmagazines, and went back to the drawing-room. Firmin kept trotting\\nafter him, like a little dog with a somewhat heavy footfall.\\n\\nOn the threshold of the drawing-room Jean paused and said: “The\\nimportant thing with burglars is to fire first, old cock. Good-night.\\nPleasant dreams.”\\n\\nHe shut the door and turned the key. Firmin stared at the decorated\\npanels blankly. The beauty of the scheme of decoration did not, at the\\nmoment, move him to admiration.\\n\\nHe looked fearfully round the empty hall and at the windows, black\\nagainst the night. Under the patter of the rain he heard\\nfootsteps—distinctly. He went hastily clumping down the hall, and along\\nthe passage to the kitchen.\\n\\nHis wife was setting his supper on the table.\\n\\n“My God!” he said. “I haven’t been so frightened since ’70.” And he\\nmopped his glistening forehead with a dish-cloth. It was not a clean\\ndish-cloth; but he did not care.\\n\\n“Frightened? What of?” said his wife.\\n\\n“Burglars! Cut-throats!” said Firmin.\\n\\nHe told her of the fears of M. Gournay-Martin, and of his own\\nappointment to the honourable and dangerous post of guard of the\\nchâteau.\\n\\n“God save us!” said his wife. “You lock the door of that beastly hall,\\nand come into the kitchen. Burglars won’t bother about the kitchen.”\\n\\n“But the master’s treasures!” protested Firmin. “He confided them to\\nme. He said so distinctly.”\\n\\n“Let the master look after his treasures himself,” said Madame Firmin,\\nwith decision. “You’ve only one throat; and I’m not going to have it\\ncut. You sit down and eat your supper. Go and lock that door first,\\nthough.”\\n\\nFirmin locked the door of the hall; then he locked the door of the\\nkitchen; then he sat down, and began to eat his supper. His appetite\\nwas hearty, but none the less he derived little pleasure from the meal.\\nHe kept stopping with the food poised on his fork, midway between the\\nplate and his mouth, for several seconds at a time, while he listened\\nwith straining ears for the sound of burglars breaking in the windows\\nof the hall. He was much too far from those windows to hear anything\\nthat happened to them, but that did not prevent him from straining his\\nears. Madame Firmin ate her supper with an air of perfect ease. She\\nfelt sure that burglars would not bother with the kitchen.\\n\\nFirmin’s anxiety made him terribly thirsty. Tumbler after tumbler of\\nwine flowed down the throat for which he feared. When he had finished\\nhis supper he went on satisfying his thirst. Madame Firmin lighted his\\npipe for him, and went and washed up the supper-dishes in the scullery.\\nThen she came back, and sat down on the other side of the hearth,\\nfacing him. About the middle of his third bottle of wine, Firmin’s\\ncold, relentless courage was suddenly restored to him. He began to talk\\nfirmly about his duty to his master, his resolve to die, if need were,\\nin defence of his interests, of his utter contempt for\\nburglars—probably Parisians. But he did not go into the hall. Doubtless\\nthe pleasant warmth of the kitchen fire held him in his chair.\\n\\nHe had described to his wife, with some ferocity, the cruel manner in\\nwhich he would annihilate the first three burglars who entered the\\nhall, and was proceeding to describe his method of dealing with the\\nfourth, when there came a loud knocking on the front door of the\\nchâteau.\\n\\nStricken silent, turned to stone, Firmin sat with his mouth open, in\\nthe midst of an unfinished word. Madame Firmin scuttled to the kitchen\\ndoor she had left unlocked on her return from the scullery, and locked\\nit. She turned, and they stared at one another.\\n\\nThe heavy knocker fell again and again and again. Between the knocking\\nthere was a sound like the roaring of lions. Husband and wife stared at\\none another with white faces. Firmin picked up his gun with trembling\\nhands, and the movement seemed to set his teeth chattering. They\\nchattered like castanets.\\n\\nThe knocking still went on, and so did the roaring.\\n\\nIt had gone on at least for five minutes, when a slow gleam of\\ncomprehension lightened Madame Firmin’s face.\\n\\n“I believe it’s the master’s voice,” she said.\\n\\n“The master’s voice!” said Firmin, in a hoarse, terrified whisper.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Madame Firmin. And she unlocked the thick door and opened\\nit a few inches.\\n\\nThe barrier removed, the well-known bellow of the millionaire came\\ndistinctly to their ears. Firmin’s courage rushed upon him in full\\nflood. He clumped across the room, brushed his wife aside, and trotted\\nto the door of the château. He unlocked it, drew the bolts, and threw\\nit open. On the steps stood the millionaire, Germaine, and Sonia. Irma\\nstood at the horse’s head.\\n\\n“What the devil have you been doing?” bellowed the millionaire. “What\\ndo you keep me standing in the rain for? Why didn’t you let me in?”\\n\\n“B-b-b-burglars—I thought you were b-b-b-burglars,” stammered Firmin.\\n\\n“Burglars!” howled the millionaire. “Do I sound like a burglar?”\\n\\nAt the moment he did not; he sounded more like a bull of Bashan. He\\nbustled past Firmin to the door of the hall.\\n\\n“Here! What’s this locked for?” he bellowed.\\n\\n“I—I—locked it in case burglars should get in while I was opening the\\nfront door,” stammered Firmin.\\n\\nThe millionaire turned the key, opened the door, and went into the\\nhall. Germaine followed him. She threw off her dripping coat, and said\\nwith some heat: “I can’t conceive why you didn’t make sure that there\\nwas a train at a quarter to nine. I will not go to Paris to-night.\\nNothing shall induce me to take that midnight train!”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” said the millionaire. “Nonsense—you’ll have to go! Where’s\\nthat infernal time-table?” He rushed to the table on to which he had\\nthrown the time-table after looking up the train, snatched it up, and\\nlooked at the cover. “Why, hang it!” he cried. “It’s for June—June,\\n1903!”\\n\\n“Oh!” cried Germaine, almost in a scream. “It’s incredible! It’s one of\\nJacques’ jokes!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\nTHE DUKE ARRIVES\\n\\n\\nThe morning was gloomy, and the police-station with its bare,\\nwhite-washed walls—their white expanse was only broken by notice-boards\\nto which were pinned portraits of criminals with details of their\\nappearance, their crime, and the reward offered for their\\napprehension—with its shabby furniture, and its dingy fireplace,\\npresented a dismal and sordid appearance entirely in keeping with the\\nSeptember grey. The inspector sat at his desk, yawning after a night\\nwhich had passed without an arrest. He was waiting to be relieved. The\\npoliceman at the door and the two policemen sitting on a bench by the\\nwall yawned in sympathy.\\n\\nThe silence of the street was broken by the rattle of an uncommonly\\nnoisy motor-car. It stopped before the door of the police-station, and\\nthe eyes of the inspector and his men turned, idly expectant, to the\\ndoor of the office.\\n\\nIt opened, and a young man in motor-coat and cap stood on the\\nthreshold.\\n\\nHe looked round the office with alert eyes, which took in everything,\\nand said, in a brisk, incisive voice: “I am the Duke of Charmerace. I\\nam here on behalf of M. Gournay-Martin. Last evening he received a\\nletter from Arsène Lupin saying he was going to break into his Paris\\nhouse this very morning.”\\n\\nAt the name of Arsène Lupin the inspector sprang from his chair, the\\npolicemen from their bench. On the instant they were wide awake,\\nattentive, full of zeal.\\n\\n“The letter, your Grace!” said the inspector briskly.\\n\\nThe Duke pulled off his glove, drew the letter from the breast-pocket\\nof his under-coat, and handed it to the inspector.\\n\\nThe inspector glanced through it, and said. “Yes, I know the\\nhandwriting well.” Then he read it carefully, and added, “Yes, yes:\\nit’s his usual letter.”\\n\\n“There’s no time to be lost,” said the Duke quickly. “I ought to have\\nbeen here hours ago—hours. I had a break-down. I’m afraid I’m too late\\nas it is.”\\n\\n“Come along, your Grace—come along, you,” said the inspector briskly.\\n\\nThe four of them hurried out of the office and down the steps of the\\npolice-station. In the roadway stood a long grey racing-car, caked with\\nmuds—grey mud, brown mud, red mud—from end to end. It looked as if it\\nhad brought samples of the soil of France from many districts.\\n\\n“Come along; I’ll take you in the car. Your men can trot along beside\\nus,” said the Duke to the inspector.\\n\\nHe slipped into the car, the inspector jumped in and took the seat\\nbeside him, and they started. They went slowly, to allow the two\\npolicemen to keep up with them. Indeed, the car could not have made any\\ngreat pace, for the tyre of the off hind-wheel was punctured and\\ndeflated.\\n\\nIn three minutes they came to the Gournay-Martin house, a wide-fronted\\nmass of undistinguished masonry, in an undistinguished row of exactly\\nthe same pattern. There were no signs that any one was living in it.\\nBlinds were drawn, shutters were up over all the windows, upper and\\nlower. No smoke came from any of its chimneys, though indeed it was\\nfull early for that.\\n\\nPulling a bunch of keys from his pocket, the Duke ran up the steps. The\\ninspector followed him. The Duke looked at the bunch, picked out the\\nlatch-key, and fitted it into the lock. It did not open it. He drew it\\nout and tried another key and another. The door remained locked.\\n\\n“Let me, your Grace,” said the inspector. “I’m more used to it. I shall\\nbe quicker.”\\n\\nThe Duke handed the keys to him, and, one after another, the inspector\\nfitted them into the lock. It was useless. None of them opened the\\ndoor.\\n\\n“They’ve given me the wrong keys,” said the Duke, with some vexation.\\n“Or no—stay—I see what’s happened. The keys have been changed.”\\n\\n“Changed?” said the inspector. “When? Where?”\\n\\n“Last night at Charmerace,” said the Duke. “M. Gournay-Martin declared\\nthat he saw a burglar slip out of one of the windows of the hall of the\\nchâteau, and we found the lock of the bureau in which the keys were\\nkept broken.”\\n\\nThe inspector seized the knocker, and hammered on the door.\\n\\n“Try that door there,” he cried to his men, pointing to a side-door on\\nthe right, the tradesmen’s entrance, giving access to the back of the\\nhouse. It was locked. There came no sound of movement in the house in\\nanswer to the inspector’s knocking.\\n\\n“Where’s the concierge?” he said.\\n\\nThe Duke shrugged his shoulders. “There’s a housekeeper, too—a woman\\nnamed Victoire,” he said. “Let’s hope we don’t find them with their\\nthroats cut.”\\n\\n“That isn’t Lupin’s way,” said the inspector. “They won’t have come to\\nmuch harm.”\\n\\n“It’s not very likely that they’ll be in a position to open doors,”\\nsaid the Duke drily.\\n\\n“Hadn’t we better have it broken open and be done with it?”\\n\\nThe inspector hesitated.\\n\\n“People don’t like their doors broken open,” he said. “And M.\\nGournay-Martin—”\\n\\n“Oh, I’ll take the responsibility of that,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, if you say so, your Grace,” said the inspector, with a brisk\\nrelief. “Henri, go to Ragoneau, the locksmith in the Rue Theobald.\\nBring him here as quickly as ever you can get him.”\\n\\n“Tell him it’s a couple of louis if he’s here inside of ten minutes,”\\nsaid the Duke.\\n\\nThe policeman hurried off. The inspector bent down and searched the\\nsteps carefully. He searched the roadway. The Duke lighted a cigarette\\nand watched him. The house of the millionaire stood next but one to the\\ncorner of a street which ran at right angles to the one in which it\\nstood, and the corner house was empty. The inspector searched the road,\\nthen he went round the corner. The other policeman went along the road,\\nsearching in the opposite direction. The Duke leant against the door\\nand smoked on patiently. He showed none of the weariness of a man who\\nhas spent the night in a long and anxious drive in a rickety motor-car.\\nHis eyes were bright and clear; he looked as fresh as if he had come\\nfrom his bed after a long night’s rest. If he had not found the South\\nPole, he had at any rate brought back fine powers of endurance from his\\nexpedition in search of it.\\n\\nThe inspector came back, wearing a disappointed air.\\n\\n“Have you found anything?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Nothing,” said the inspector.\\n\\nHe came up the steps and hammered again on the door. No one answered\\nhis knock. There was a clatter of footsteps, and Henri and the\\nlocksmith, a burly, bearded man, his bag of tools slung over his\\nshoulder, came hurrying up. He was not long getting to work, but it was\\nnot an easy job. The lock was strong. At the end of five minutes he\\nsaid that he might spend an hour struggling with the lock itself;\\nshould he cut away a piece of the door round it?\\n\\n“Cut away,” said the Duke.\\n\\nThe locksmith changed his tools, and in less than three minutes he had\\ncut away a square piece from the door, a square in which the lock was\\nfixed, and taken it bodily away.\\n\\nThe door opened. The inspector drew his revolver, and entered the\\nhouse. The Duke followed him. The policemen drew their revolvers, and\\nfollowed the Duke. The big hall was but dimly lighted. One of the\\npolicemen quickly threw back the shutters of the windows and let in the\\nlight. The hall was empty, the furniture in perfect order; there were\\nno signs of burglary there.\\n\\n“The concierge?” said the inspector, and his men hurried through the\\nlittle door on the right which opened into the concierge’s rooms. In\\nhalf a minute one of them came out and said: “Gagged and bound, and his\\nwife too.”\\n\\n“But the rooms which were to be plundered are upstairs,” said the\\nDuke—“the big drawing-rooms on the first floor. Come on; we may be just\\nin time. The scoundrels may not yet have got away.”\\n\\nHe ran quickly up the stairs, followed by the inspector, and hurried\\nalong the corridor to the door of the big drawing-room. He threw it\\nopen, and stopped dead on the threshold. He had arrived too late.\\n\\nThe room was in disorder. Chairs were overturned, there were empty\\nspaces on the wall where the finest pictures of the millionaire had\\nbeen hung. The window facing the door was wide open. The shutters were\\nbroken; one of them was hanging crookedly from only its bottom hinge.\\nThe top of a ladder rose above the window-sill, and beside it,\\nastraddle the sill, was an Empire card-table, half inside the room,\\nhalf out. On the hearth-rug, before a large tapestry fire-screen, which\\nmasked the wide fireplace, built in imitation of the big, wide\\nfireplaces of our ancestors, and rose to the level of the\\nchimney-piece—a magnificent chimney-piece in carved oak-were some\\nchairs tied together ready to be removed.\\n\\nThe Duke and the inspector ran to the window, and looked down into the\\ngarden. It was empty. At the further end of it, on the other side of\\nits wall, rose the scaffolding of a house a-building. The burglars had\\nfound every convenience to their hand—a strong ladder, an egress\\nthrough the door in the garden wall, and then through the gap formed by\\nthe house in process of erection, which had rendered them independent\\nof the narrow passage between the walls of the gardens, which debouched\\ninto a side-street on the right.\\n\\nThe Duke turned from the window, glanced at the wall opposite, then, as\\nif something had caught his eye, went quickly to it.\\n\\n“Look here,” he said, and he pointed to the middle of one of the empty\\nspaces in which a picture had hung.\\n\\nThere, written neatly in blue chalk, were the words:\\n\\nARSÈNE LUPIN\\n\\n“This is a job for Guerchard,” said the inspector. “But I had better\\nget an examining magistrate to take the matter in hand first.” And he\\nran to the telephone.\\n\\nThe Duke opened the folding doors which led into the second\\ndrawing-room. The shutters of the windows were open, and it was plain\\nthat Arsène Lupin had plundered it also of everything that had struck\\nhis fancy. In the gaps between the pictures on the walls was again the\\nsignature “Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\nThe inspector was shouting impatiently into the telephone, bidding a\\nservant wake her master instantly. He did not leave the telephone till\\nhe was sure that she had done so, that her master was actually awake,\\nand had been informed of the crime. The Duke sat down in an easy chair\\nand waited for him.\\n\\nWhen he had finished telephoning, the inspector began to search the two\\nrooms for traces of the burglars. He found nothing, not even a\\nfinger-mark.\\n\\nWhen he had gone through the two rooms he said, “The next thing to do\\nis to find the house-keeper. She may be sleeping still—she may not even\\nhave heard the noise of the burglars.”\\n\\n“I find all this extremely interesting,” said the Duke; and he followed\\nthe inspector out of the room.\\n\\nThe inspector called up the two policemen, who had been freeing the\\nconcierge and going through the rooms on the ground-floor. They did not\\nthen examine any more of the rooms on the first floor to discover if\\nthey also had been plundered. They went straight up to the top of the\\nhouse, the servants’ quarters.\\n\\nThe inspector called, “Victoire! Victoire!” two or three times; but\\nthere was no answer.\\n\\nThey opened the door of room after room and looked in, the inspector\\ntaking the rooms on the right, the policemen the rooms on the left.\\n\\n“Here we are,” said one of the policemen. “This room’s been recently\\noccupied.” They looked in, and saw that the bed was unmade. Plainly\\nVictoire had slept in it.\\n\\n“Where can she be?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Be?” said the inspector. “I expect she’s with the burglars—an\\naccomplice.”\\n\\n“I gather that M. Gournay-Martin had the greatest confidence in her,”\\nsaid the Duke.\\n\\n“He’ll have less now,” said the inspector drily. “It’s generally the\\nconfidential ones who let their masters down.”\\n\\nThe inspector and his men set about a thorough search of the house.\\nThey found the other rooms undisturbed. In half an hour they had\\nestablished the fact that the burglars had confined their attention to\\nthe two drawing-rooms. They found no traces of them; and they did not\\nfind Victoire. The concierge could throw no light on her disappearance.\\nHe and his wife had been taken by surprise in their sleep and in the\\ndark.\\n\\nThey had been gagged and bound, they declared, without so much as\\nhaving set eyes on their assailants. The Duke and the inspector came\\nback to the plundered drawing-room.\\n\\nThe inspector looked at his watch and went to the telephone.\\n\\n“I must let the Prefecture know,” he said.\\n\\n“Be sure you ask them to send Guerchard,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Guerchard?” said the inspector doubtfully.\\n\\n“M. Formery, the examining magistrate, does not get on very well with\\nGuerchard.”\\n\\n“What sort of a man is M. Formery? Is he capable?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, yes—yes. He’s very capable,” said the inspector quickly. “But he\\ndoesn’t have very good luck.”\\n\\n“M. Gournay-Martin particularly asked me to send for Guerchard if I\\narrived too late, and found the burglary already committed,” said the\\nDuke. “It seems that there is war to the knife between Guerchard and\\nthis Arsène Lupin. In that case Guerchard will leave no stone unturned\\nto catch the rascal and recover the stolen treasures. M. Gournay-Martin\\nfelt that Guerchard was the man for this piece of work very strongly\\nindeed.”\\n\\n“Very good, your Grace,” said the inspector. And he rang up the\\nPrefecture of Police.\\n\\nThe Duke heard him report the crime and ask that Guerchard should be\\nsent. The official in charge at the moment seemed to make some demur.\\n\\nThe Duke sprang to his feet, and said in an anxious tone, “Perhaps I’d\\nbetter speak to him myself.”\\n\\nHe took his place at the telephone and said, “I am the Duke of\\nCharmerace. M. Gournay-Martin begged me to secure the services of M.\\nGuerchard. He laid the greatest stress on my securing them, if on\\nreaching Paris I found that the crime had already been committed.”\\n\\nThe official at the other end of the line hesitated. He did not refuse\\non the instant as he had refused the inspector. It may be that he\\nreflected that M. Gournay-Martin was a millionaire and a man of\\ninfluence; that the Duke of Charmerace was a Duke; that he, at any\\nrate, had nothing whatever to gain by running counter to their wishes.\\nHe said that Chief-Inspector Guerchard was not at the Prefecture, that\\nhe was off duty; that he would send down two detectives, who were on\\nduty, at once, and summon Chief-Inspector Guerchard with all speed. The\\nDuke thanked him and rang off.\\n\\n“That’s all right,” he said cheerfully, turning to the inspector. “What\\ntime will M. Formery be here?”\\n\\n“Well, I don’t expect him for another hour,” said the inspector. “He\\nwon’t come till he’s had his breakfast. He always makes a good\\nbreakfast before setting out to start an inquiry, lest he shouldn’t\\nfind time to make one after he’s begun it.”\\n\\n“Breakfast—breakfast—that’s a great idea,” said the Duke. “Now you come\\nto remind me, I’m absolutely famished. I got some supper on my way late\\nlast night; but I’ve had nothing since. I suppose nothing interesting\\nwill happen till M. Formery comes; and I may as well get some food. But\\nI don’t want to leave the house. I think I’ll see what the concierge\\ncan do for me.”\\n\\nSo saying, he went downstairs and interviewed the concierge. The\\nconcierge seemed to be still doubtful whether he was standing on his\\nhead or his heels, but he undertook to supply the needs of the Duke.\\nThe Duke gave him a louis, and he hurried off to get food from a\\nrestaurant.\\n\\nThe Duke went upstairs to the bathroom and refreshed himself with a\\ncold bath. By the time he had bathed and dressed the concierge had a\\nmeal ready for him in the dining-room. He ate it with the heartiest\\nappetite. Then he sent out for a barber and was shaved.\\n\\nHe then repaired to the pillaged drawing-room, disposed himself in the\\nmost restful attitude on a sofa, and lighted an excellent cigar. In the\\nmiddle of it the inspector came to him. He was not wearing a very\\ncheerful air; and he told the Duke that he had found no clue to the\\nperpetrators of the crime, though M. Dieusy and M. Bonavent, the\\ndetectives from the Prefecture of Police, had joined him in the search.\\n\\nThe Duke was condoling with him on this failure when they heard a\\nknocking at the front door, and then voices on the stairs.\\n\\n“Ah! Here is M. Formery!” said the inspector cheerfully. “Now we can\\nget on.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\nM. FORMERY OPENS THE INQUIRY\\n\\n\\nThe examining magistrate came into the room. He was a plump and pink\\nlittle man, with very bright eyes. His bristly hair stood up straight\\nall over his head, giving it the appearance of a broad, dapple-grey\\nclothes-brush. He appeared to be of the opinion that Nature had given\\nthe world the toothbrush as a model of what a moustache should be; and\\nhis own was clipped to that pattern.\\n\\n“The Duke of Charmerace, M. Formery,” said the inspector.\\n\\nThe little man bowed and said, “Charmed, charmed to make your\\nacquaintance, your Grace—though the occasion—the occasion is somewhat\\npainful. The treasures of M. Gournay-Martin are known to all the world.\\nFrance will deplore his losses.” He paused, and added hastily, “But we\\nshall recover them—we shall recover them.”\\n\\nThe Duke rose, bowed, and protested his pleasure at making the\\nacquaintance of M. Formery.\\n\\n“Is this the scene of the robbery, inspector?” said M. Formery; and he\\nrubbed his hands together with a very cheerful air.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said the inspector. “These two rooms seem to be the only\\nones touched, though of course we can’t tell till M. Gournay-Martin\\narrives. Jewels may have been stolen from the bedrooms.”\\n\\n“I fear that M. Gournay-Martin won’t be of much help for some days,”\\nsaid the Duke. “When I left him he was nearly distracted; and he won’t\\nbe any better after a night journey to Paris from Charmerace. But\\nprobably these are the only two rooms touched, for in them M.\\nGournay-Martin had gathered together the gems of his collection. Over\\nthe doors hung some pieces of Flemish tapestry—marvels—the composition\\nadmirable—the colouring delightful.”\\n\\n“It is easy to see that your Grace was very fond of them,” said M.\\nFormery.\\n\\n“I should think so,” said the Duke. “I looked on them as already\\nbelonging to me, for my father-in-law was going to give them to me as a\\nwedding present.”\\n\\n“A great loss—a great loss. But we will recover them, sooner or later,\\nyou can rest assured of it. I hope you have touched nothing in this\\nroom. If anything has been moved it may put me off the scent\\naltogether. Let me have the details, inspector.”\\n\\nThe inspector reported the arrival of the Duke at the police-station\\nwith Arsène Lupin’s letter to M. Gournay-Martin; the discovery that the\\nkeys had been changed and would not open the door of the house; the\\nopening of it by the locksmith; the discovery of the concierge and his\\nwife gagged and bound.\\n\\n“Probably accomplices,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Does Lupin always work with accomplices?” said the Duke. “Pardon my\\nignorance—but I’ve been out of France for so long—before he attained to\\nthis height of notoriety.”\\n\\n“Lupin—why Lupin?” said M. Formery sharply.\\n\\n“Why, there is the letter from Lupin which my future father-in-law\\nreceived last night; its arrival was followed by the theft of his two\\nswiftest motor-cars; and then, these signatures on the wall here,” said\\nthe Duke in some surprise at the question.\\n\\n“Lupin! Lupin! Everybody has Lupin on the brain!” said M. Formery\\nimpatiently. “I’m sick of hearing his name. This letter and these\\nsignatures are just as likely to be forgeries as not.”\\n\\n“I wonder if Guerchard will take that view,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Guerchard? Surely we’re not going to be cluttered up with Guerchard.\\nHe has Lupin on the brain worse than any one else.”\\n\\n“But M. Gournay-Martin particularly asked me to send for Guerchard if I\\narrived too late to prevent the burglary. He would never forgive me if\\nI had neglected his request: so I telephoned for him—to the Prefecture\\nof Police,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, well, if you’ve already telephoned for him. But it was\\nunnecessary—absolutely unnecessary,” said M. Formery sharply.\\n\\n“I didn’t know,” said the Duke politely.\\n\\n“Oh, there was no harm in it—it doesn’t matter,” said M. Formery in a\\ndiscontented tone with a discontented air.\\n\\nHe walked slowly round the room, paused by the windows, looked at the\\nladder, and scanned the garden:\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin,” he said scornfully. “Arsène Lupin doesn’t leave traces\\nall over the place. There’s nothing but traces. Are we going to have\\nthat silly Lupin joke all over again?”\\n\\n“I think, sir, that this time joke is the word, for this is a burglary\\npure and simple,” said the inspector.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s plain as daylight,” said M. Formery “The burglars came in by\\nthis window, and they went out by it.”\\n\\nHe crossed the room to a tall safe which stood before the unused door.\\nThe safe was covered with velvet, and velvet curtains hung before its\\ndoor. He drew the curtains, and tried the handle of the door of the\\nsafe. It did not turn; the safe was locked.\\n\\n“As far as I can see, they haven’t touched this,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Thank goodness for that,” said the Duke. “I believe, or at least my\\nfiancée does, that M. Gournay-Martin keeps the most precious thing in\\nhis collection in that safe—the coronet.”\\n\\n“What! the famous coronet of the Princesse de Lamballe?” said M.\\nFormery.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“But according to your report, inspector, the letter signed ‘Lupin’\\nannounced that he was going to steal the coronet also.”\\n\\n“It did—in so many words,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Well, here is a further proof that we’re not dealing with Lupin. That\\nrascal would certainly have put his threat into execution, M. Formery,”\\nsaid the inspector.\\n\\n“Who’s in charge of the house?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“The concierge, his wife, and a housekeeper—a woman named Victoire,”\\nsaid the inspector.\\n\\n“I’ll see to the concierge and his wife presently. I’ve sent one of\\nyour men round for their dossier. When I get it I’ll question them. You\\nfound them gagged and bound in their bedroom?”\\n\\n“Yes, M. Formery; and always this imitation of Lupin—a yellow gag, blue\\ncords, and the motto, ‘I take, therefore I am,’ on a scrap of\\ncardboard—his usual bag of tricks.”\\n\\n“Then once again they’re going to touch us up in the papers. It’s any\\nodds on it,” said M. Formery gloomily. “Where’s the housekeeper? I\\nshould like to see her.”\\n\\n“The fact is, we don’t know where she is,” said the inspector.\\n\\n“You don’t know where she is?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“We can’t find her anywhere,” said the inspector.\\n\\n“That’s excellent, excellent. We’ve found the accomplice,” said M.\\nFormery with lively delight; and he rubbed his hands together. “At\\nleast, we haven’t found her, but we know her.”\\n\\n“I don’t think that’s the case,” said the Duke. “At least, my future\\nfather-in-law and my fiancée had both of them the greatest confidence\\nin her. Yesterday she telephoned to us at the château de Charmerace.\\nAll the jewels were left in her charge, and the wedding presents as\\nthey were sent in.”\\n\\n“And these jewels and wedding presents—have they been stolen too?” said\\nM. Formery.\\n\\n“They don’t seem to have been touched,” said the Duke, “though of\\ncourse we can’t tell till M. Gournay-Martin arrives. As far as I can\\nsee, the burglars have only touched these two drawing-rooms.”\\n\\n“That’s very annoying,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“I don’t find it so,” said the Duke, smiling.\\n\\n“I was looking at it from the professional point of view,” said M.\\nFormery. He turned to the inspector and added, “You can’t have searched\\nthoroughly. This housekeeper must be somewhere about—if she’s really\\ntrustworthy. Have you looked in every room in the house?”\\n\\n“In every room—under every bed—in every corner and every cupboard,”\\nsaid the inspector.\\n\\n“Bother!” said M. Formery. “Are there no scraps of torn clothes, no\\nblood-stains, no traces of murder, nothing of interest?”\\n\\n“Nothing!” said the inspector.\\n\\n“But this is very regrettable,” said M. Formery. “Where did she sleep?\\nWas her bed unmade?”\\n\\n“Her room is at the top of the house,” said the inspector. “The bed had\\nbeen slept in, but she does not appear to have taken away any of her\\nclothes.”\\n\\n“Extraordinary! This is beginning to look a very complicated business,”\\nsaid M. Formery gravely.\\n\\n“Perhaps Guerchard will be able to throw a little more light on it,”\\nsaid the Duke.\\n\\nM. Formery frowned and said, “Yes, yes. Guerchard is a good assistant\\nin a business like this. A little visionary, a little\\nfanciful—wrong-headed, in fact; but, after all, he IS Guerchard. Only,\\nsince Lupin is his bugbear, he’s bound to find some means of muddling\\nus up with that wretched animal. You’re going to see Lupin mixed up\\nwith all this to a dead certainty, your Grace.”\\n\\nThe Duke looked at the signatures on the wall. “It seems to me that he\\nis pretty well mixed up with it already,” he said quietly.\\n\\n“Believe me, your Grace, in a criminal affair it is, above all things,\\nnecessary to distrust appearances. I am growing more and more confident\\nthat some ordinary burglars have committed this crime and are trying to\\nput us off the scent by diverting our attention to Lupin.”\\n\\nThe Duke stooped down carelessly and picked up a book which had fallen\\nfrom a table.\\n\\n“Excuse me, but please—please—do not touch anything,” said M. Formery\\nquickly.\\n\\n“Why, this is odd,” said the Duke, staring at the floor.\\n\\n“What is odd?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Well, this book looks as if it had been knocked off the table by one\\nof the burglars. And look here; here’s a footprint under it—a footprint\\non the carpet,” said the Duke.\\n\\nM. Formery and the inspector came quickly to the spot. There, where the\\nbook had fallen, plainly imprinted on the carpet, was a white\\nfootprint. M. Formery and the inspector stared at it.\\n\\n“It looks like plaster. How did plaster get here?” said M. Formery,\\nfrowning at it.\\n\\n“Well, suppose the robbers came from the garden,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Of course they came from the garden, your Grace. Where else should\\nthey come from?” said M. Formery, with a touch of impatience in his\\ntone.\\n\\n“Well, at the end of the garden they’re building a house,” said the\\nDuke.\\n\\n“Of course, of course,” said M. Formery, taking him up quickly. “The\\nburglars came here with their boots covered with plaster. They’ve swept\\naway all the other marks of their feet from the carpet; but whoever did\\nthe sweeping was too slack to lift up that book and sweep under it.\\nThis footprint, however, is not of great importance, though it is\\ncorroborative of all the other evidence we have that they came and went\\nby the garden. There’s the ladder, and that table half out of the\\nwindow. Still, this footprint may turn out useful, after all. You had\\nbetter take the measurements of it, inspector. Here’s a foot-rule for\\nyou. I make a point of carrying this foot-rule about with me, your\\nGrace. You would be surprised to learn how often it has come in\\nuseful.”\\n\\nHe took a little ivory foot-rule from his waist-coat pocket, and gave\\nit to the inspector, who fell on his knees and measured the footprint\\nwith the greatest care.\\n\\n“I must take a careful look at that house they’re building. I shall\\nfind a good many traces there, to a dead certainty,” said M. Formery.\\n\\nThe inspector entered the measurements of the footprint in his\\nnote-book. There came the sound of a knocking at the front door.\\n\\n“I shall find footprints of exactly the same dimensions as this one at\\nthe foot of some heap of plaster beside that house,” said M. Formery;\\nwith an air of profound conviction, pointing through the window to the\\nhouse building beyond the garden.\\n\\nA policeman opened the door of the drawing-room and saluted.\\n\\n“If you please, sir, the servants have arrived from Charmerace,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\n“Let them wait in the kitchen and the servants’ offices,” said M.\\nFormery. He stood silent, buried in profound meditation, for a couple\\nof minutes. Then he turned to the Duke and said, “What was that you\\nsaid about a theft of motor-cars at Charmerace?”\\n\\n“When he received the letter from Arsène Lupin, M. Gournay-Martin\\ndecided to start for Paris at once,” said the Duke. “But when we sent\\nfor the cars we found that they had just been stolen. M.\\nGournay-Martin’s chauffeur and another servant were in the garage\\ngagged and bound. Only an old car, a hundred horse-power Mercrac, was\\nleft. I drove it to Paris, leaving M. Gournay-Martin and his family to\\ncome on by train.”\\n\\n“Very important—very important indeed,” said M. Formery. He thought for\\na moment, and then added. “Were the motor-cars the only things stolen?\\nWere there no other thefts?”\\n\\n“Well, as a matter of fact, there was another theft, or rather an\\nattempt at theft,” said the Duke with some hesitation. “The rogues who\\nstole the motor-cars presented themselves at the château under the name\\nof Charolais—a father and three sons—on the pretext of buying the\\nhundred-horse-power Mercrac. M. Gournay-Martin had advertised it for\\nsale in the Rennes Advertiser. They were waiting in the big hall of the\\nchâteau, which the family uses as the chief living-room, for the return\\nof M. Gournay-Martin. He came; and as they left the hall one of them\\nattempted to steal a pendant set with pearls which I had given to\\nMademoiselle Gournay-Martin half an hour before. I caught him in the\\nact and saved the pendant.”\\n\\n“Good! good! Wait—we have one of the gang—wait till I question him,”\\nsaid M. Formery, rubbing his hands; and his eyes sparkled with joy.\\n\\n“Well, no; I’m afraid we haven’t,” said the Duke in an apologetic tone.\\n\\n“What! We haven’t? Has he escaped from the police? Oh, those country\\npolice!” cried M. Formery.\\n\\n“No; I didn’t charge him with the theft,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“You didn’t charge him with the theft?” cried M. Formery, astounded.\\n\\n“No; he was very young and he begged so hard. I had the pendant. I let\\nhim go,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, your Grace, your Grace! Your duty to society!” cried M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes, it does seem to have been rather weak,” said the Duke; “but there\\nyou are. It’s no good crying over spilt milk.”\\n\\nM. Formery folded his arms and walked, frowning, backwards and forwards\\nacross the room.\\n\\nHe stopped, raised his hand with a gesture commanding attention, and\\nsaid, “I have no hesitation in saying that there is a connection—an\\nintimate connection—between the thefts at Charmerace and this\\nburglary!”\\n\\nThe Duke and the inspector gazed at him with respectful eyes—at least,\\nthe eyes of the inspector were respectful; the Duke’s eyes twinkled.\\n\\n“I am gathering up the threads,” said M. Formery. “Inspector, bring up\\nthe concierge and his wife. I will question them on the scene of the\\ncrime. Their dossier should be here. If it is, bring it up with them;\\nif not, no matter; bring them up without it.”\\n\\nThe inspector left the drawing-room. M. Formery plunged at once into\\nfrowning meditation.\\n\\n“I find all this extremely interesting,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Charmed! Charmed!” said M. Formery, waving his hand with an\\nabsent-minded air.\\n\\nThe inspector entered the drawing-room followed by the concierge and\\nhis wife. He handed a paper to M. Formery. The concierge, a bearded man\\nof about sixty, and his wife, a somewhat bearded woman of about\\nfifty-five, stared at M. Formery with fascinated, terrified eyes. He\\nsat down in a chair, crossed his legs, read the paper through, and then\\nscrutinized them keenly.\\n\\n“Well, have you recovered from your adventure?” he said.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir,” said the concierge. “They hustled us a bit, but they\\ndid not really hurt us.”\\n\\n“Nothing to speak of, that is,” said his wife. “But all the same, it’s\\na disgraceful thing that an honest woman can’t sleep in peace in her\\nbed of a night without being disturbed by rascals like that. And if the\\npolice did their duty things like this wouldn’t happen. And I don’t\\ncare who hears me say it.”\\n\\n“You say that you were taken by surprise in your sleep?” said M.\\nFormery. “You say you saw nothing, and heard nothing?”\\n\\n“There was no time to see anything or hear anything. They trussed us up\\nlike greased lightning,” said the concierge.\\n\\n“But the gag was the worst,” said the wife. “To lie there and not be\\nable to tell the rascals what I thought about them!”\\n\\n“Didn’t you hear the noise of footsteps in the garden?” said M.\\nFormery.\\n\\n“One can’t hear anything that happens in the garden from our bedroom,”\\nsaid the concierge.\\n\\n“Even the night when Mlle. Germaine’s great Dane barked from twelve\\no’clock till seven in the morning, all the household was kept awake\\nexcept us; but bless you, sir, we slept like tops,” said his wife\\nproudly.\\n\\n“If they sleep like that it seems rather a waste of time to have gagged\\nthem,” whispered the Duke to the inspector.\\n\\nThe inspector grinned, and whispered scornfully, “Oh, them common\\nfolks; they do sleep like that, your Grace.”\\n\\n“Didn’t you hear any noise at the front door?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“No, we heard no noise at the door,” said the concierge.\\n\\n“Then you heard no noise at all the whole night?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir, we heard noise enough after we’d been gagged,” said the\\nconcierge.\\n\\n“Now, this is important,” said M. Formery. “What kind of a noise was\\nit?”\\n\\n“Well, it was a bumping kind of noise,” said the concierge. “And there\\nwas a noise of footsteps, walking about the room.”\\n\\n“What room? Where did these noises come from?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“From the room over our heads—the big drawing-room,” said the\\nconcierge.\\n\\n“Didn’t you hear any noise of a struggle, as if somebody was being\\ndragged about—no screaming or crying?” said M. Formery.\\n\\nThe concierge and his wife looked at one another with inquiring eyes.\\n\\n“No, I didn’t,” said the concierge.\\n\\n“Neither did I,” said his wife.\\n\\nM. Formery paused. Then he said, “How long have you been in the service\\nof M. Gournay-Martin?”\\n\\n“A little more than a year,” said the concierge.\\n\\nM. Formery looked at the paper in his hand, frowned, and said severely,\\n“I see you’ve been convicted twice, my man.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, but—”\\n\\n“My husband’s an honest man, sir—perfectly honest,” broke in his wife.\\n“You’ve only to ask M. Gournay-Martin; he’ll—”\\n\\n“Be so good as to keep quiet, my good woman,” said M. Formery; and,\\nturning to her husband, he went on: “At your first conviction you were\\nsentenced to a day’s imprisonment with costs; at your second conviction\\nyou got three days’ imprisonment.”\\n\\n“I’m not going to deny it, sir,” said the concierge; “but it was an\\nhonourable imprisonment.”\\n\\n“Honourable?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“The first time, I was a gentleman’s servant, and I got a day’s\\nimprisonment for crying, ‘Hurrah for the General Strike!’—on the first\\nof May.”\\n\\n“You were a valet? In whose service?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“In the service of M. Genlis, the Socialist leader.”\\n\\n“And your second conviction?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“It was for having cried in the porch of Ste. Clotilde, ‘Down with the\\ncows!’—meaning the police, sir,” said the concierge.\\n\\n“And were you in the service of M. Genlis then?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“No, sir; I was in the service of M. Bussy-Rabutin, the Royalist\\ndeputy.”\\n\\n“You don’t seem to have very well-defined political convictions,” said\\nM. Formery.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, sir, I have,” the concierge protested. “I’m always devoted to\\nmy masters; and I have the same opinions that they have—always.”\\n\\n“Very good; you can go,” said M. Formery.\\n\\nThe concierge and his wife left the room, looking as if they did not\\nquite know whether to feel relieved or not.\\n\\n“Those two fools are telling the exact truth, unless I’m very much\\nmistaken,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“They look honest enough people,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Well, now to examine the rest of the house,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“I’ll come with you, if I may,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“By all means, by all means,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“I find it all so interesting,” said the Duke,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\nGUERCHARD ASSISTS\\n\\n\\nLeaving a policeman on guard at the door of the drawing-room M.\\nFormery, the Duke, and the inspector set out on their tour of\\ninspection. It was a long business, for M. Formery examined every room\\nwith the most scrupulous care—with more care, indeed, than he had\\ndisplayed in his examination of the drawing-rooms. In particular he\\nlingered long in the bedroom of Victoire, discussing the possibilities\\nof her having been murdered and carried away by the burglars along with\\ntheir booty. He seemed, if anything, disappointed at finding no\\nblood-stains, but to find real consolation in the thought that she\\nmight have been strangled. He found the inspector in entire agreement\\nwith every theory he enunciated, and he grew more and more disposed to\\nregard him as a zealous and trustworthy officer. Also he was not at all\\ndispleased at enjoying this opportunity of impressing the Duke with his\\npowers of analysis and synthesis. He was unaware that, as a rule, the\\nDuke’s eyes did not usually twinkle as they twinkled during this solemn\\nand deliberate progress through the house of M. Gournay-Martin. M.\\nFormery had so exactly the air of a sleuthhound; and he was even\\nnoisier.\\n\\nHaving made this thorough examination of the house, M. Formery went out\\ninto the garden and set about examining that. There were footprints on\\nthe turf about the foot of the ladder, for the grass was close-clipped,\\nand the rain had penetrated and softened the soil; but there were\\nhardly as many footprints as might have been expected, seeing that the\\nburglars must have made many journeys in the course of robbing the\\ndrawing-rooms of so many objects of art, some of them of considerable\\nweight. The footprints led to a path of hard gravel; and M. Formery led\\nthe way down it, out of the door in the wall at the bottom of the\\ngarden, and into the space round the house which was being built.\\n\\nAs M. Formery had divined, there was a heap, or, to be exact, there\\nwere several heaps of plaster about the bottom of the scaffolding.\\nUnfortunately, there were also hundreds of footprints. M. Formery\\nlooked at them with longing eyes; but he did not suggest that the\\ninspector should hunt about for a set of footprints of the size of the\\none he had so carefully measured on the drawing-room carpet.\\n\\nWhile they were examining the ground round the half-built house a man\\ncame briskly down the stairs from the second floor of the house of M.\\nGournay-Martin. He was an ordinary-looking man, almost insignificant,\\nof between forty and fifty, and of rather more than middle height. He\\nhad an ordinary, rather shapeless mouth, an ordinary nose, an ordinary\\nchin, an ordinary forehead, rather low, and ordinary ears. He was\\nwearing an ordinary top-hat, by no means new. His clothes were the\\nordinary clothes of a fairly well-to-do citizen; and his boots had been\\nchosen less to set off any slenderness his feet might possess than for\\ntheir comfortable roominess. Only his eyes relieved his face from\\ninsignificance. They were extraordinarily alert eyes, producing in\\nthose on whom they rested the somewhat uncomfortable impression that\\nthe depths of their souls were being penetrated. He was the famous\\nChief-Inspector Guerchard, head of the Detective Department of the\\nPrefecture of Police, and sworn foe of Arsène Lupin.\\n\\nThe policeman at the door of the drawing-room saluted him briskly. He\\nwas a fine, upstanding, red-faced young fellow, adorned by a rich black\\nmoustache of extraordinary fierceness.\\n\\n“Shall I go and inform M. Formery that you have come, M. Guerchard?” he\\nsaid.\\n\\n“No, no; there’s no need to take the trouble,” said Guerchard in a\\ngentle, rather husky voice. “Don’t bother any one about me—I’m of no\\nimportance.”\\n\\n“Oh, come, M. Guerchard,” protested the policeman.\\n\\n“Of no importance,” said M. Guerchard decisively. “For the present, M.\\nFormery is everything. I’m only an assistant.”\\n\\nHe stepped into the drawing-room and stood looking about it, curiously\\nstill. It was almost as if the whole of his being was concentrated in\\nthe act of seeing—as if all the other functions of his mind and body\\nwere in suspension.\\n\\n“M. Formery and the inspector have just been up to examine the\\nhousekeeper’s room. It’s right at the top of the house—on the second\\nfloor. You take the servants’ staircase. Then it’s right at the end of\\nthe passage on the left. Would you like me to take you up to it, sir?”\\nsaid the policeman eagerly. His heart was in his work.\\n\\n“Thank you, I know where it is—I’ve just come from it,” said Guerchard\\ngently.\\n\\nA grin of admiration widened the already wide mouth of the policeman,\\nand showed a row of very white, able-looking teeth.\\n\\n“Ah, M. Guerchard!” he said, “you’re cleverer than all the examining\\nmagistrates in Paris put together!”\\n\\n“You ought not to say that, my good fellow. I can’t prevent you\\nthinking it, of course; but you ought not to say it,” said Guerchard\\nwith husky gentleness; and the faintest smile played round the corners\\nof his mouth.\\n\\nHe walked slowly to the window, and the policeman walked with him.\\n\\n“Have you noticed this, sir?” said the policeman, taking hold of the\\ntop of the ladder with a powerful hand. “It’s probable that the\\nburglars came in and went away by this ladder.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“They have even left this card-table on the window-sill,” said the\\npoliceman; and he patted the card-table with his other powerful hand.\\n\\n“Thank you, thank you,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“They don’t think it’s Lupin’s work at all,” said the policeman. “They\\nthink that Lupin’s letter announcing the burglary and these signatures\\non the walls are only a ruse.”\\n\\n“Is that so?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Is there any way I can help you, sir?” said policeman.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard. “Take up your post outside that door and admit\\nno one but M. Formery, the inspector, Bonavent, or Dieusy, without\\nconsulting me.” And he pointed to the drawing-room door.\\n\\n“Shan’t I admit the Duke of Charmerace? He’s taking a great interest in\\nthis affair,” said the policeman.\\n\\n“The Duke of Charmerace? Oh, yes—admit the Duke of Charmerace,” said\\nGuerchard.\\n\\nThe policeman went to his post of responsibility, a proud man.\\n\\nHardly had the door closed behind him when Guerchard was all\\nactivity—activity and eyes. He examined the ladder, the gaps on the\\nwall from which the pictures had been taken, the signatures of Arsène\\nLupin. The very next thing he did was to pick up the book which the\\nDuke had set on the top of the footprint again, to preserve it; and he\\nmeasured, pacing it, the distance between the footprint and the window.\\n\\nThe result of this measuring did not appear to cause him any\\nsatisfaction, for he frowned, measured the distance again, and then\\nstared out of the window with a perplexed air, thinking hard. It was\\ncurious that, when he concentrated himself on a process of reasoning,\\nhis eves seemed to lose something of their sharp brightness and grew a\\nlittle dim.\\n\\nAt last he seemed to come to some conclusion. He turned away from the\\nwindow, drew a small magnifying-glass from his pocket, dropped on his\\nhands and knees, and began to examine the surface of the carpet with\\nthe most minute care.\\n\\nHe examined a space of it nearly six feet square, stopped, and gazed\\nround the room. His eyes rested on the fireplace, which he could see\\nunder the bottom of the big tapestried fire-screen which was raised on\\nlegs about a foot high, fitted with big casters. His eyes filled with\\ninterest; without rising, he crawled quickly across the room, peeped\\nround the edge of the screen and rose, smiling.\\n\\nHe went on to the further drawing-room and made the same careful\\nexamination of it, again examining a part of the surface of the carpet\\nwith his magnifying-glass. He came back to the window to which the\\nladder had been raised and examined very carefully the broken shutter.\\nHe whistled softly to himself, lighted a cigarette, and leant against\\nthe side of the window. He looked out of it, with dull eyes which saw\\nnothing, the while his mind worked upon the facts he had discovered.\\n\\nHe had stood there plunged in reflection for perhaps ten minutes, when\\nthere came a sound of voices and footsteps on the stairs. He awoke from\\nhis absorption, seemed to prick his ears, then slipped a leg over the\\nwindow-ledge, and disappeared from sight down the ladder.\\n\\nThe door opened, and in came M. Formery, the Duke, and the inspector.\\nM. Formery looked round the room with eyes which seemed to expect to\\nmeet a familiar sight, then walked to the other drawing-room and looked\\nround that. He turned to the policeman, who had stepped inside the\\ndrawing-room, and said sharply, “M. Guerchard is not here.”\\n\\n“I left him here,” said the policeman. “He must have disappeared. He’s\\na wonder.”\\n\\n“Of course,” said M. Formery. “He has gone down the ladder to examine\\nthat house they’re building. He’s just following in our tracks and\\ndoing all over again the work we’ve already done. He might have saved\\nhimself the trouble. We could have told him all he wants to know. But\\nthere! He very likely would not be satisfied till he had seen\\neverything for himself.”\\n\\n“He may see something which we have missed,” said the Duke.\\n\\nM. Formery frowned, and said sharply “That’s hardly likely. I don’t\\nthink that your Grace realizes to what a perfection constant practice\\nbrings one’s power of observation. The inspector and I will cheerfully\\neat anything we’ve missed—won’t we, inspector?” And he laughed heartily\\nat his joke.\\n\\n“It might always prove a large mouthful,” said the Duke with an\\nironical smile.\\n\\nM. Formery assumed his air of profound reflection, and walked a few\\nsteps up and down the room, frowning:\\n\\n“The more I think about it,” he said, “the clearer it grows that we\\nhave disposed of the Lupin theory. This is the work of far less expert\\nrogues than Lupin. What do you think, inspector?”\\n\\n“Yes; I think you have disposed of that theory, sir,” said the\\ninspector with ready acquiescence.\\n\\n“All the same, I’d wager anything that we haven’t disposed of it to the\\nsatisfaction of Guerchard,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Then he must be very hard to satisfy,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, in any other matter he’s open to reason,” said M. Formery; “but\\nLupin is his fixed idea; it’s an obsession—almost a mania.”\\n\\n“But yet he never catches him,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No; and he never will. His very obsession by Lupin hampers him. It\\ncramps his mind and hinders its working,” said M. Formery.\\n\\nHe resumed his meditative pacing, stopped again, and said:\\n\\n“But considering everything, especially the absence of any traces of\\nviolence, combined with her entire disappearance, I have come to\\nanother conclusion. Victoire is the key to the mystery. She is the\\naccomplice. She never slept in her bed. She unmade it to put us off the\\nscent. That, at any rate, is something gained, to have found the\\naccomplice. We shall have this good news, at least, to tell M,\\nGournay-Martin on his arrival.”\\n\\n“Do you really think that she’s the accomplice?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“I’m dead sure of it,” said M. Formery. “We will go up to her room and\\nmake another thorough examination of it.”\\n\\nGuerchard’s head popped up above the window-sill:\\n\\n“My dear M. Formery,” he said, “I beg that you will not take the\\ntrouble.”\\n\\nM. Formery’s mouth opened: “What! You, Guerchard?” he stammered.\\n\\n“Myself,” said Guerchard; and he came to the top of the ladder and\\nslipped lightly over the window-sill into the room.\\n\\nHe shook hands with M. Formery and nodded to the inspector. Then he\\nlooked at the Duke with an air of inquiry.\\n\\n“Let me introduce you,” said M. Formery. “Chief-Inspector Guerchard,\\nhead of the Detective Department—the Duke of Charmerace.”\\n\\nThe Duke shook hands with Guerchard, saying, “I’m delighted to make\\nyour acquaintance, M. Guerchard. I’ve been expecting your coming with\\nthe greatest interest. Indeed it was I who begged the officials at the\\nPrefecture of Police to put this case in your hands. I insisted on it.”\\n\\n“What were you doing on that ladder?” said M. Formery, giving Guerchard\\nno time to reply to the Duke.\\n\\n“I was listening,” said Guerchard simply—“listening. I like to hear\\npeople talk when I’m engaged on a case. It’s a distraction—and it\\nhelps. I really must congratulate you, my dear M. Formery, on the\\nadmirable manner in which you have conducted this inquiry.”\\n\\nM. Formery bowed, and regarded him with a touch of suspicion.\\n\\n“There are one or two minor points on which we do not agree, but on the\\nwhole your method has been admirable,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Well, about Victoire,” said M. Formery. “You’re quite sure that an\\nexamination, a more thorough examination, of her room, is unnecessary?”\\n\\n“Yes, I think so,” said Guerchard. “I have just looked at it myself.”\\n\\nThe door opened, and in came Bonavent, one of the detectives who had\\ncome earlier from the Prefecture. In his hand he carried a scrap of\\ncloth.\\n\\nHe saluted Guerchard, and said to M. Formery, “I have just found this\\nscrap of cloth on the edge of the well at the bottom of the garden. The\\nconcierge’s wife tells me that it has been torn from Victoire’s dress.”\\n\\n“I feared it,” said M. Formery, taking the scrap of cloth from him. “I\\nfeared foul play. We must go to the well at once, send some one down\\nit, or have it dragged.”\\n\\nHe was moving hastily to the door, when Guerchard said, in his husky,\\ngentle voice, “I don’t think there is any need to look for Victoire in\\nthe well.”\\n\\n“But this scrap of cloth,” said M. Formery, holding it out to him.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, that scrap of cloth,” said Guerchard. And, turning to the\\nDuke, he added, “Do you know if there’s a dog or cat in the house, your\\nGrace? I suppose that, as the fiance of Mademoiselle Gournay-Martin,\\nyou are familiar with the house?”\\n\\n“What on earth—” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Excuse me,” interrupted Guerchard. “But this is important—very\\nimportant.”\\n\\n“Yes, there is a cat,” said the Duke. “I’ve seen a cat at the door of\\nthe concierge’s rooms.”\\n\\n“It must have been that cat which took this scrap of cloth to the edge\\nof the well,” said Guerchard gravely.\\n\\n“This is ridiculous—preposterous!” cried M. Formery, beginning to\\nflush. “Here we’re dealing with a most serious crime—a murder—the\\nmurder of Victoire—and you talk about cats!”\\n\\n“Victoire has not been murdered,” said Guerchard; and his husky voice\\nwas gentler than ever, only just audible.\\n\\n“But we don’t know that—we know nothing of the kind,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“I do,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“You?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Then how do you explain her disappearance?”\\n\\n“If she had disappeared I shouldn’t explain it,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“But since she has disappeared?” cried M. Formery, in a tone of\\nexasperation.\\n\\n“She hasn’t,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“You know nothing about it!” cried M. Formery, losing his temper.\\n\\n“Yes, I do,” said Guerchard, with the same gentleness.\\n\\n“Come, do you mean to say that you know where she is?” cried M.\\nFormery.\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Do you mean to tell us straight out that you’ve seen her?” cried M.\\nFormery.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; I’ve seen her,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“You’ve seen her—when?” cried M. Formery.\\n\\nGuerchard paused to consider. Then he said gently:\\n\\n“It must have been between four and five minutes ago.”\\n\\n“But hang it all, you haven’t been out of this room!” cried M. Formery.\\n\\n“No, I haven’t,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“And you’ve seen her?” cried M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard, raising his voice a little.\\n\\n“Well, why the devil don’t you tell us where she is? Tell us!” cried M.\\nFormery, purple with exasperation.\\n\\n“But you won’t let me get a word out of my mouth,” protested Guerchard\\nwith aggravating gentleness.\\n\\n“Well, speak!” cried M. Formery; and he sank gasping on to a chair.\\n\\n“Ah, well, she’s here,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Here! How did she GET here?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“On a mattress,” said Guerchard.\\n\\nM. Formery sat upright, almost beside himself, glaring furiously at\\nGuerchard:\\n\\n“What do you stand there pulling all our legs for?” he almost howled.\\n\\n“Look here,” said Guerchard.\\n\\nHe walked across the room to the fireplace, pushed the chairs which\\nstood bound together on the hearth-rug to one side of the fireplace,\\nand ran the heavy fire-screen on its casters to the other side of it,\\nrevealing to their gaze the wide, old-fashioned fireplace itself. The\\niron brazier which held the coals had been moved into the corner, and a\\nmattress lay on the floor of the fireplace. On the mattress lay the\\nfigure of a big, middle-aged woman, half-dressed. There was a yellow\\ngag in her mouth; and her hands and feet were bound together with blue\\ncords.\\n\\n“She is sleeping soundly,” said Guerchard. He stooped and picked up a\\nhandkerchief, and smelt it. “There’s the handkerchief they chloroformed\\nher with. It still smells of chloroform.”\\n\\nThey stared at him and the sleeping woman.\\n\\n“Lend a hand, inspector,” he said. “And you too, Bonavent. She looks a\\ngood weight.”\\n\\nThe three of them raised the mattress, and carried it and the sleeping\\nwoman to a broad couch, and laid them on it. They staggered under their\\nburden, for truly Victoire was a good weight.\\n\\nM. Formery rose, with recovered breath, but with his face an even\\nricher purple. His eyes were rolling in his head, as if they were not\\nunder proper control.\\n\\nHe turned on the inspector and cried savagely, “You never examined the\\nfireplace, inspector!”\\n\\n“No, sir,” said the downcast inspector.\\n\\n“It was unpardonable—absolutely unpardonable!” cried M. Formery. “How\\nis one to work with subordinates like this?”\\n\\n“It was an oversight,” said Guerchard.\\n\\nM. Formery turned to him and said, “You must admit that it was\\nmaterially impossible for me to see her.”\\n\\n“It was possible if you went down on all fours,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“On all fours?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes; on all fours you could see her heels sticking out beyond the\\nmattress,” said Guerchard simply.\\n\\nM. Formery shrugged his shoulders: “That screen looked as if it had\\nstood there since the beginning of the summer,” he said.\\n\\n“The first thing, when you’re dealing with Lupin, is to distrust\\nappearances,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Lupin!” cried M. Formery hotly. Then he bit his lip and was silent.\\n\\nHe walked to the side of the couch and looked down on the sleeping\\nVictoire, frowning: “This upsets everything,” he said. “With these new\\nconditions, I’ve got to begin all over again, to find a new explanation\\nof the affair. For the moment—for the moment, I’m thrown completely off\\nthe track. And you, Guerchard?”\\n\\n“Oh, well,” said Guerchard, “I have an idea or two about the matter\\nstill.”\\n\\n“Do you really mean to say that it hasn’t thrown you off the track\\ntoo?” said M. Formery, with a touch of incredulity in his tone.\\n\\n“Well, no—not exactly,” said Guerchard. “I wasn’t on that track, you\\nsee.”\\n\\n“No, of course not—of course not. You were on the track of Lupin,” said\\nM. Formery; and his contemptuous smile was tinged with malice.\\n\\nThe Duke looked from one to the other of them with curious, searching\\neyes: “I find all this so interesting,” he said.\\n\\n“We do not take much notice of these checks; they do not depress us for\\na moment,” said M. Formery, with some return of his old grandiloquence.\\n“We pause hardly for an instant; then we begin to reconstruct—to\\nreconstruct.”\\n\\n“It’s perfectly splendid of you,” said the Duke, and his limpid eyes\\nrested on M. Formery’s self-satisfied face in a really affectionate\\ngaze; they might almost be said to caress it.\\n\\nGuerchard looked out of the window at a man who was carrying a hod-full\\nof bricks up one of the ladders set against the scaffolding of the\\nbuilding house. Something in this honest workman’s simple task seemed\\nto amuse him, for he smiled.\\n\\nOnly the inspector, thinking of the unexamined fireplace, looked really\\ndepressed.\\n\\n“We shan’t get anything out of this woman till she wakes,” said M.\\nFormery, “When she does, I shall question her closely and fully. In the\\nmeantime, she may as well be carried up to her bedroom to sleep off the\\neffects of the chloroform.”\\n\\nGuerchard turned quickly: “Not her own bedroom, I think,” he said\\ngently.\\n\\n“Certainly not—of course, not her own bedroom,” said M. Formery\\nquickly.\\n\\n“And I think an officer at the door of whatever bedroom she does sleep\\nin,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Undoubtedly—most necessary,” said M. Formery gravely. “See to it,\\ninspector. You can take her away.”\\n\\nThe inspector called in a couple of policemen, and with their aid he\\nand Bonavent raised the sleeping woman, a man at each corner of the\\nmattress, and bore her from the room.\\n\\n“And now to reconstruct,” said M. Formery; and he folded his arms and\\nplunged into profound reflection.\\n\\nThe Duke and Guerchard watched him in silence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\nTHE FAMILY ARRIVES\\n\\n\\nIn carrying out Victoire, the inspector had left the door of the\\ndrawing-room open. After he had watched M. Formery reflect for two\\nminutes, Guerchard faded—to use an expressive Americanism—through it.\\nThe Duke felt in the breast-pocket of his coat, murmured softly, “My\\ncigarettes,” and followed him.\\n\\nHe caught up Guerchard on the stairs and said, “I will come with you,\\nif I may, M. Guerchard. I find all these investigations extraordinarily\\ninteresting. I have been observing M. Formery’s methods—I should like\\nto watch yours, for a change.”\\n\\n“By all means,” said Guerchard. “And there are several things I want to\\nhear about from your Grace. Of course it might be an advantage to\\ndiscuss them together with M. Formery, but—” and he hesitated.\\n\\n“It would be a pity to disturb M. Formery in the middle of the process\\nof reconstruction,” said the Duke; and a faint, ironical smile played\\nround the corners of his sensitive lips.\\n\\nGuerchard looked at him quickly: “Perhaps it would,” he said.\\n\\nThey went through the house, out of the back door, and into the garden.\\nGuerchard moved about twenty yards from the house, then he stopped and\\nquestioned the Duke at great length. He questioned him first about the\\nCharolais, their appearance, their actions, especially about Bernard’s\\nattempt to steal the pendant, and the theft of the motor-cars.\\n\\n“I have been wondering whether M. Charolais might not have been Arsène\\nLupin himself,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“It’s quite possible,” said Guerchard. “There seem to be no limits\\nwhatever to Lupin’s powers of disguising himself. My colleague,\\nGanimard, has come across him at least three times that he knows of, as\\na different person. And no single time could he be sure that it was the\\nsame man. Of course, he had a feeling that he was in contact with some\\none he had met before, but that was all. He had no certainty. He may\\nhave met him half a dozen times besides without knowing him. And the\\nphotographs of him—they’re all different. Ganimard declares that Lupin\\nis so extraordinarily successful in his disguises because he is a great\\nactor. He actually becomes for the time being the person he pretends to\\nbe. He thinks and feels absolutely like that person. Do you follow me?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; but he must be rather fluid, this Lupin,” said the Duke; and\\nthen he added thoughtfully, “It must be awfully risky to come so often\\ninto actual contact with men like Ganimard and you.”\\n\\n“Lupin has never let any consideration of danger prevent him doing\\nanything that caught his fancy. He has odd fancies, too. He’s a\\nhumourist of the most varied kind—grim, ironic, farcical, as the mood\\ntakes him. He must be awfully trying to live with,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Do you think humourists are trying to live with?” said the Duke, in a\\nmeditative tone. “I think they brighten life a good deal; but of course\\nthere are people who do not like them—the middle-classes.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, they’re all very well in their place; but to live with they\\nmust be trying,” said Guerchard quickly.\\n\\nHe went on to question the Duke closely and at length about the\\nhousehold of M. Gournay-Martin, saying that Arsène Lupin worked with\\nthe largest gang a burglar had ever captained, and it was any odds that\\nhe had introduced one, if not more, of that gang into it. Moreover, in\\nthe case of a big affair like this, Lupin himself often played two or\\nthree parts under as many disguises.\\n\\n“If he was Charolais, I don’t see how he could be one of M.\\nGournay-Martin’s household, too,” said the Duke in some perplexity.\\n\\n“I don’t say that he WAS Charolais,” said Guerchard. “It is quite a\\nmoot point. On the whole, I’m inclined to think that he was not. The\\ntheft of the motor-cars was a job for a subordinate. He would hardly\\nbother himself with it.”\\n\\nThe Duke told him all that he could remember about the millionaire’s\\nservants—and, under the clever questioning of the detective, he was\\nsurprised to find how much he did remember—all kinds of odd details\\nabout them which he had scarcely been aware of observing.\\n\\nThe two of them, as they talked, afforded an interesting contrast: the\\nDuke, with his air of distinction and race, his ironic expression, his\\nmobile features, his clear enunciation and well-modulated voice, his\\neasy carriage of an accomplished fencer—a fencer with muscles of\\nsteel—seemed to be a man of another kind from the slow-moving\\ndetective, with his husky voice, his common, slurring enunciation, his\\nclumsily moulded features, so ill adapted to the expression of emotion\\nand intelligence. It was a contrast almost between the hawk and the\\nmole, the warrior and the workman. Only in their eyes were they alike;\\nboth of them had the keen, alert eyes of observers. Perhaps the most\\ncurious thing of all was that, in spite of the fact that he had for so\\nmuch of his life been an idler, trifling away his time in the pursuit\\nof pleasure, except when he had made his expedition to the South Pole,\\nthe Duke gave one the impression of being a cleverer man, of a far\\nfiner brain, than the detective who had spent so much of his life\\nsharpening his wits on the more intricate problems of crime.\\n\\nWhen Guerchard came to the end of his questions, the Duke said: “You\\nhave given me a very strong feeling that it is going to be a deuce of a\\njob to catch Lupin. I don’t wonder that, so far, you have none of you\\nlaid hands on him.”\\n\\n“But we have!” cried Guerchard quickly. “Twice Ganimard has caught him.\\nOnce he had him in prison, and actually brought him to trial. Lupin\\nbecame another man, and was let go from the very dock.”\\n\\n“Really? It sounds absolutely amazing,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“And then, in the affair of the Blue Diamond, Ganimard caught him\\nagain. He has his weakness, Lupin—it’s women. It’s a very common\\nweakness in these masters of crime. Ganimard and Holmlock Shears, in\\nthat affair, got the better of him by using his love for a woman—‘the\\nfair-haired lady,’ she was called—to nab him.”\\n\\n“A shabby trick,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Shabby?” said Guerchard in a tone of utter wonder. “How can anything\\nbe shabby in the case of a rogue like this?”\\n\\n“Perhaps not—perhaps not—still—” said the Duke, and stopped.\\n\\nThe expression of wonder faded from Guerchard’s face, and he went on,\\n“Well, Holmlock Shears recovered the Blue Diamond, and Ganimard nabbed\\nLupin. He held him for ten minutes, then Lupin escaped.”\\n\\n“What became of the fair-haired lady?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“I don’t know. I have heard that she is dead,” said Guerchard. “Now I\\ncome to think of it, I heard quite definitely that she died.”\\n\\n“It must be awful for a woman to love a man like Lupin—the constant,\\nwearing anxiety,” said the Duke thoughtfully.\\n\\n“I dare say. Yet he can have his pick of sweethearts. I’ve been offered\\nthousands of francs by women—women of your Grace’s world and wealthy\\nViennese—to make them acquainted with Lupin,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“You don’t surprise me,” said the Duke with his ironic smile. “Women\\nnever do stop to think—where one of their heroes is concerned. And did\\nyou do it?”\\n\\n“How could I? If I only could! If I could find Lupin entangled with a\\nwoman like Ganimard did—well—” said Guerchard between his teeth.\\n\\n“He’d never get out of YOUR clutches,” said the Duke with conviction.\\n\\n“I think not—I think not,” said Guerchard grimly. “But come, I may as\\nwell get on.”\\n\\nHe walked across the turf to the foot of the ladder and looked at the\\nfootprints round it. He made but a cursory examination of them, and\\ntook his way down the garden-path, out of the door in the wall into the\\nspace about the house that was building. He was not long examining it,\\nand he went right through it out into the street on which the house\\nwould face when it was finished. He looked up and down it, and began to\\nretrace his footsteps.\\n\\n“I’ve seen all I want to see out here. We may as well go back to the\\nhouse,” he said to the Duke.\\n\\n“I hope you’ve seen what you expected to see,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Exactly what I expected to see—exactly,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“That’s as it should be,” said the Duke.\\n\\nThey went back to the house and found M. Formery in the drawing-room,\\nstill engaged in the process of reconstruction.\\n\\n“The thing to do now is to hunt the neighbourhood for witnesses of the\\ndeparture of the burglars with their booty. Loaded as they were with\\nsuch bulky objects, they must have had a big conveyance. Somebody must\\nhave noticed it. They must have wondered why it was standing in front\\nof a half-built house. Somebody may have actually seen the burglars\\nloading it, though it was so early in the morning. Bonavent had better\\ninquire at every house in the street on which that half-built house\\nfaces. Did you happen to notice the name of it?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“It’s Sureau Street,” said Guerchard. “But Dieusy has been hunting the\\nneighbourhood for some one who saw the burglars loading their\\nconveyance, or saw it waiting to be loaded, for the last hour.”\\n\\n“Good,” said M. Formery. “We are getting on.”\\n\\nM. Formery was silent. Guerchard and the Duke sat down and lighted\\ncigarettes.\\n\\n“You found plenty of traces,” said M. Formery, waving his hand towards\\nthe window.\\n\\n“Yes; I’ve found plenty of traces,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Of Lupin?” said M. Formery, with a faint sneer.\\n\\n“No; not of Lupin,” said Guerchard.\\n\\nA smile of warm satisfaction illumined M. Formery’s face:\\n\\n“What did I tell you?” he said. “I’m glad that you’ve changed your mind\\nabout that.”\\n\\n“I have hardly changed my mind,” said Guerchard, in his husky, gentle\\nvoice.\\n\\nThere came a loud knocking on the front door, the sound of excited\\nvoices on the stairs. The door opened, and in burst M. Gournay-Martin.\\nHe took one glance round the devastated room, raised his clenched hands\\ntowards the ceiling, and bellowed, “The scoundrels! the dirty\\nscoundrels!” And his voice stuck in his throat. He tottered across the\\nroom to a couch, dropped heavily to it, gazed round the scene of\\ndesolation, and burst into tears.\\n\\nGermaine and Sonia came into the room. The Duke stepped forward to\\ngreet them.\\n\\n“Do stop crying, papa. You’re as hoarse as a crow as it is,” said\\nGermaine impatiently. Then, turning on the Duke with a frown, she said:\\n“I think that joke of yours about the train was simply disgraceful,\\nJacques. A joke’s a joke, but to send us out to the station on a night\\nlike last night, through all that heavy rain, when you knew all the\\ntime that there was no quarter-to-nine train—it was simply\\ndisgraceful.”\\n\\n“I really don’t know what you’re talking about,” said the Duke quietly.\\n“Wasn’t there a quarter-to-nine train?”\\n\\n“Of course there wasn’t,” said Germaine. “The time-table was years old.\\nI think it was the most senseless attempt at a joke I ever heard of.”\\n\\n“It doesn’t seem to me to be a joke at all,” said the Duke quietly. “At\\nany rate, it isn’t the kind of a joke I make—it would be detestable. I\\nnever thought to look at the date of the time-table. I keep a box of\\ncigarettes in that drawer, and I have noticed the time-table there. Of\\ncourse, it may have been lying there for years. It was stupid of me not\\nto look at the date.”\\n\\n“I said it was a mistake. I was sure that his Grace would not do\\nanything so unkind as that,” said Sonia.\\n\\nThe Duke smiled at her.\\n\\n“Well, all I can say is, it was very stupid of you not to look at the\\ndate,” said Germaine.\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin rose to his feet and wailed, in the most heartrending\\nfashion: “My pictures! My wonderful pictures! Such investments! And my\\ncabinets! My Renaissance cabinets! They can’t be replaced! They were\\nunique! They were worth a hundred and fifty thousand francs.”\\n\\nM. Formery stepped forward with an air and said, “I am distressed, M.\\nGournay-Martin—truly distressed by your loss. I am M. Formery,\\nexamining magistrate.”\\n\\n“It is a tragedy, M. Formery—a tragedy!” groaned the millionaire.\\n\\n“Do not let it upset you too much. We shall find your masterpieces—we\\nshall find them. Only give us time,” said M. Formery in a tone of warm\\nencouragement.\\n\\nThe face of the millionaire brightened a little.\\n\\n“And, after all, you have the consolation, that the burglars did not\\nget hold of the gem of your collection. They have not stolen the\\ncoronet of the Princesse de Lamballe,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“No,” said the Duke. “They have not touched this safe. It is unopened.”\\n\\n“What has that got to do with it?” growled the millionaire quickly.\\n“That safe is empty.”\\n\\n“Empty ... but your coronet?” cried the Duke.\\n\\n“Good heavens! Then they HAVE stolen it,” cried the millionaire\\nhoarsely, in a panic-stricken voice.\\n\\n“But they can’t have—this safe hasn’t been touched,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“But the coronet never was in that safe. It was—have they entered my\\nbedroom?” said the millionaire.\\n\\n“No,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“They don’t seem to have gone through any of the rooms except these\\ntwo,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Ah, then my mind is at rest about that. The safe in my bedroom has\\nonly two keys. Here is one.” He took a key from his waistcoat pocket\\nand held it out to them. “And the other is in this safe.”\\n\\nThe face of M. Formery was lighted up with a splendid satisfaction. He\\nmight have rescued the coronet with his own hands. He cried\\ntriumphantly, “There, you see!”\\n\\n“See? See?” cried the millionaire in a sudden bellow. “I see that they\\nhave robbed me—plundered me. Oh, my pictures! My wonderful pictures!\\nSuch investments!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\nTHE THEFT OF THE PENDANT\\n\\n\\nThey stood round the millionaire observing his anguish, with eyes in\\nwhich shone various degrees of sympathy. As if no longer able to bear\\nthe sight of such woe, Sonia slipped out of the room.\\n\\nThe millionaire lamented his loss and abused the thieves by turns, but\\nalways at the top of his magnificent voice.\\n\\nSuddenly a fresh idea struck him. He clapped his hand to his brow and\\ncried: “That eight hundred pounds! Charolais will never buy the Mercrac\\nnow! He was not a bona fide purchaser!”\\n\\nThe Duke’s lips parted slightly and his eyes opened a trifle wider than\\ntheir wont. He turned sharply on his heel, and almost sprang into the\\nother drawing-room. There he laughed at his ease.\\n\\nM. Formery kept saying to the millionaire: “Be calm, M. Gournay-Martin.\\nBe calm! We shall recover your masterpieces. I pledge you my word. All\\nwe need is time. Have patience. Be calm!”\\n\\nHis soothing remonstrances at last had their effect. The millionaire\\ngrew calm:\\n\\n“Guerchard?” he said. “Where is Guerchard?”\\n\\nM. Formery presented Guerchard to him.\\n\\n“Are you on their track? Have you a clue?” said the millionaire.\\n\\n“I think,” said M. Formery in an impressive tone, “that we may now\\nproceed with the inquiry in the ordinary way.”\\n\\nHe was a little piqued by the millionaire’s so readily turning from him\\nto the detective. He went to a writing-table, set some sheets of paper\\nbefore him, and prepared to make notes on the answers to his questions.\\nThe Duke came back into the drawing-room; the inspector was summoned.\\nM. Gournay-Martin sat down on a couch with his hands on his knees and\\ngazed gloomily at M. Formery. Germaine, who was sitting on a couch near\\nthe door, waiting with an air of resignation for her father to cease\\nhis lamentations, rose and moved to a chair nearer the writing-table.\\nGuerchard kept moving restlessly about the room, but noiselessly. At\\nlast he came to a standstill, leaning against the wall behind M.\\nFormery.\\n\\nM. Formery went over all the matters about which he had already\\nquestioned the Duke. He questioned the millionaire and his daughter\\nabout the Charolais, the theft of the motor-cars, and the attempted\\ntheft of the pendant. He questioned them at less length about the\\ncomposition of their household—the servants and their characters. He\\nelicited no new fact.\\n\\nHe paused, and then he said, carelessly as a mere matter of routine: “I\\nshould like to know, M. Gournay-Martin, if there has ever been any\\nother robbery committed at your house?”\\n\\n“Three years ago this scoundrel Lupin—” the millionaire began\\nviolently.\\n\\n“Yes, yes; I know all about that earlier burglary. But have you been\\nrobbed since?” said M. Formery, interrupting him.\\n\\n“No, I haven’t been robbed since that burglary; but my daughter has,”\\nsaid the millionaire.\\n\\n“Your daughter?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes; I have been robbed two or three times during the last three\\nyears,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Dear me! But you ought to have told us about this before. This is\\nextremely interesting, and most important,” said M. Formery, rubbing\\nhis hands, “I suppose you suspect Victoire?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t,” said Germaine quickly. “It couldn’t have been Victoire.\\nThe last two thefts were committed at the château when Victoire was in\\nParis in charge of this house.”\\n\\nM. Formery seemed taken aback, and he hesitated, consulting his notes.\\nThen he said: “Good—good. That confirms my hypothesis.”\\n\\n“What hypothesis?” said M. Gournay-Martin quickly.\\n\\n“Never mind—never mind,” said M. Formery solemnly. And, turning to\\nGermaine, he went on: “You say, Mademoiselle, that these thefts began\\nabout three years ago?”\\n\\n“Yes, I think they began about three years ago in August.”\\n\\n“Let me see. It was in the month of August, three years ago, that your\\nfather, after receiving a threatening letter like the one he received\\nlast night, was the victim of a burglary?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes, it was—the scoundrels!” cried the millionaire fiercely.\\n\\n“Well, it would be interesting to know which of your servants entered\\nyour service three years ago,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Victoire has only been with us a year at the outside,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Only a year?” said M. Formery quickly, with an air of some vexation.\\nHe paused and added, “Exactly—exactly. And what was the nature of the\\nlast theft of which you were the victim?”\\n\\n“It was a pearl brooch—not unlike the pendant which his Grace gave me\\nyesterday,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Would you mind showing me that pendant? I should like to see it,” said\\nM. Formery.\\n\\n“Certainly—show it to him, Jacques. You have it, haven’t you?” said\\nGermaine, turning to the Duke.\\n\\n“Me? No. How should I have it?” said the Duke in some surprise.\\n“Haven’t you got it?”\\n\\n“I’ve only got the case—the empty case,” said Germaine, with a startled\\nair.\\n\\n“The empty case?” said the Duke, with growing surprise.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Germaine. “It was after we came back from our useless\\njourney to the station. I remembered suddenly that I had started\\nwithout the pendant. I went to the bureau and picked up the case; and\\nit was empty.”\\n\\n“One moment—one moment,” said M. Formery. “Didn’t you catch this young\\nBernard Charolais with this case in his hands, your Grace?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Duke. “I caught him with it in his pocket.”\\n\\n“Then you may depend upon it that the young rascal had slipped the\\npendant out of its case and you only recovered the empty case from\\nhim,” said M. Formery triumphantly.\\n\\n“No,” said the Duke. “That is not so. Nor could the thief have been the\\nburglar who broke open the bureau to get at the keys. For long after\\nboth of them were out of the house I took a cigarette from the box\\nwhich stood on the bureau beside the case which held the pendant. And\\nit occurred to me that the young rascal might have played that very\\ntrick on me. I opened the case and the pendant was there.”\\n\\n“It has been stolen!” cried the millionaire; “of course it has been\\nstolen.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, no,” said the Duke. “It hasn’t been stolen. Irma, or perhaps\\nMademoiselle Kritchnoff, has brought it to Paris for Germaine.”\\n\\n“Sonia certainly hasn’t brought it. It was she who suggested to me that\\nyou had seen it lying on the bureau, and slipped it into your pocket,”\\nsaid Germaine quickly.\\n\\n“Then it must be Irma,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“We had better send for her and make sure,” said M. Formery.\\n“Inspector, go and fetch her.”\\n\\nThe inspector went out of the room and the Duke questioned Germaine and\\nher father about the journey, whether it had been very uncomfortable,\\nand if they were very tired by it. He learned that they had been so\\nfortunate as to find sleeping compartments on the train, so that they\\nhad suffered as little as might be from their night of travel.\\n\\nM. Formery looked through his notes; Guerchard seemed to be going to\\nsleep where he stood against the wall.\\n\\nThe inspector came back with Irma. She wore the frightened,\\nhalf-defensive, half-defiant air which people of her class wear when\\nconfronted by the authorities. Her big, cow’s eyes rolled uneasily.\\n\\n“Oh, Irma—” Germaine began.\\n\\nM. Formery cut her short, somewhat brusquely. “Excuse me, excuse me. I\\nam conducting this inquiry,” he said. And then, turning to Irma, he\\nadded, “Now, don’t be frightened, Mademoiselle Irma; I want to ask you\\na question or two. Have you brought up to Paris the pendant which the\\nDuke of Charmerace gave your mistress yesterday?”\\n\\n“Me, sir? No, sir. I haven’t brought the pendant,” said Irma.\\n\\n“You’re quite sure?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes, sir; I haven’t seen the pendant. Didn’t Mademoiselle Germaine\\nleave it on the bureau?” said Irma.\\n\\n“How do you know that?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“I heard Mademoiselle Germaine say that it had been on the bureau. I\\nthought that perhaps Mademoiselle Kritchnoff had put it in her bag.”\\n\\n“Why should Mademoiselle Kritchnoff put it in her bag?” said the Duke\\nquickly.\\n\\n“To bring it up to Paris for Mademoiselle Germaine,” said Irma.\\n\\n“But what made you think that?” said Guerchard, suddenly intervening.\\n\\n“Oh, I thought Mademoiselle Kritchnoff might have put it in her bag\\nbecause I saw her standing by the bureau,” said Irma.\\n\\n“Ah, and the pendant was on the bureau?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Irma.\\n\\nThere was a silence. Suddenly the atmosphere of the room seemed to have\\nbecome charged with an oppression—a vague menace. Guerchard seemed to\\nhave become wide awake again. Germaine and the Duke looked at one\\nanother uneasily.\\n\\n“Have you been long in the service of Mademoiselle Gournay-Martin?”\\nsaid M. Formery.\\n\\n“Six months, sir,” said Irma.\\n\\n“Very good, thank you. You can go,” said M. Formery. “I may want you\\nagain presently.”\\n\\nIrma went quickly out of the room with an air of relief.\\n\\nM. Formery scribbled a few words on the paper before him and then said:\\n“Well, I will proceed to question Mademoiselle Kritchnoff.”\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Kritchnoff is quite above suspicion,” said the Duke\\nquickly.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, quite,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“How long has Mademoiselle Kritchnoff been in your service,\\nMademoiselle?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Let me think,” said Germaine, knitting her brow.\\n\\n“Can’t you remember?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Just about three years,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“That’s exactly the time at which the thefts began,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Germaine, reluctantly.\\n\\n“Ask Mademoiselle Kritchnoff to come here, inspector,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said the inspector.\\n\\n“I’ll go and fetch her—I know where to find her,” said the Duke\\nquickly, moving toward the door.\\n\\n“Please, please, your Grace,” protested Guerchard. “The inspector will\\nfetch her.”\\n\\nThe Duke turned sharply and looked at him: “I beg your pardon, but do\\nyou—” he said.\\n\\n“Please don’t be annoyed, your Grace,” Guerchard interrupted. “But M.\\nFormery agrees with me—it would be quite irregular.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, your Grace,” said M. Formery. “We have our method of\\nprocedure. It is best to adhere to it—much the best. It is the result\\nof years of experience of the best way of getting the truth.”\\n\\n“Just as you please,” said the Duke, shrugging his shoulders.\\n\\nThe inspector came into the room: “Mademoiselle Kritchnoff will be here\\nin a moment. She was just going out.”\\n\\n“She was going out?” said M. Formery. “You don’t mean to say you’re\\nletting members of the household go out?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” said the inspector. “I mean that she was just asking if she\\nmight go out.”\\n\\nM. Formery beckoned the inspector to him, and said to him in a voice\\ntoo low for the others to hear:\\n\\n“Just slip up to her room and search her trunks.”\\n\\n“There is no need to take the trouble,” said Guerchard, in the same low\\nvoice, but with sufficient emphasis.\\n\\n“No, of course not. There’s no need to take the trouble,” M. Formery\\nrepeated after him.\\n\\nThe door opened, and Sonia came in. She was still wearing her\\ntravelling costume, and she carried her cloak on her arm. She stood\\nlooking round her with an air of some surprise; perhaps there was even\\na touch of fear in it. The long journey of the night before did not\\nseem to have dimmed at all her delicate beauty. The Duke’s eyes rested\\non her in an inquiring, wondering, even searching gaze. She looked at\\nhim, and her own eyes fell.\\n\\n“Will you come a little nearer, Mademoiselle?” said M. Formery. “There\\nare one or two questions—”\\n\\n“Will you allow me?” said Guerchard, in a tone of such deference that\\nit left M. Formery no grounds for refusal.\\n\\nM. Formery flushed and ground his teeth. “Have it your own way!” he\\nsaid ungraciously.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Kritchnoff,” said Guerchard, in a tone of the most\\ngood-natured courtesy, “there is a matter on which M. Formery needs\\nsome information. The pendant which the Duke of Charmerace gave\\nMademoiselle Gournay-Martin yesterday has been stolen.”\\n\\n“Stolen? Are you sure?” said Sonia in a tone of mingled surprise and\\nanxiety.\\n\\n“Quite sure,” said Guerchard. “We have exactly determined the\\nconditions under which the theft was committed. But we have every\\nreason to believe that the culprit, to avoid detection, has hidden the\\npendant in the travelling-bag or trunk of somebody else in order to—”\\n\\n“My bag is upstairs in my bedroom, sir,” Sonia interrupted quickly.\\n“Here is the key of it.”\\n\\nIn order to free her hands to take the key from her wrist-bag, she set\\nher cloak on the back of a couch. It slipped off it, and fell to the\\nground at the feet of the Duke, who had not returned to his place\\nbeside Germaine. While she was groping in her bag for the key, and all\\neyes were on her, the Duke, who had watched her with a curious\\nintentness ever since her entry into the room, stooped quietly down and\\npicked up the cloak. His hand slipped into the pocket of it; his\\nfingers touched a hard object wrapped in tissue-paper. They closed\\nround it, drew it from the pocket, and, sheltered by the cloak,\\ntransferred it to his own. He set the cloak on the back of the sofa,\\nand very softly moved back to his place by Germaine’s side. No one in\\nthe room observed the movement, not even Guerchard: he was watching\\nSonia too intently.\\n\\nSonia found the key, and held it out to Guerchard.\\n\\nHe shook his head and said: “There is no reason to search your bag—none\\nwhatever. Have you any other luggage?”\\n\\nShe shrank back a little from his piercing eyes, almost as if their\\ngaze scared her.\\n\\n“Yes, my trunk ... it’s upstairs in my bedroom too ... open.”\\n\\nShe spoke in a faltering voice, and her troubled eyes could not meet\\nthose of the detective.\\n\\n“You were going out, I think,” said Guerchard gently.\\n\\n“I was asking leave to go out. There is some shopping that must be\\ndone,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“You do not see any reason why Mademoiselle Kritchnoff should not go\\nout, M. Formery, do you?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, no, none whatever; of course she can go out,” said M. Formery.\\n\\nSonia turned round to go.\\n\\n“One moment,” said Guerchard, coming forward. “You’ve only got that\\nwrist-bag with you?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Sonia. “I have my money and my handkerchief in it.” And she\\nheld it out to him.\\n\\nGuerchard’s keen eyes darted into it; and he muttered, “No point in\\nlooking in that. I don’t suppose any one would have had the audacity—”\\nand he stopped.\\n\\nSonia made a couple of steps toward the door, turned, hesitated, came\\nback to the couch, and picked up her cloak.\\n\\nThere was a sudden gleam in Guerchard’s eyes—a gleam of understanding,\\nexpectation, and triumph. He stepped forward, and holding out his\\nhands, said: “Allow me.”\\n\\n“No, thank you,” said Sonia. “I’m not going to put it on.”\\n\\n“No ... but it’s possible ... some one may have ... have you felt in\\nthe pockets of it? That one, now? It seems as if that one—”\\n\\nHe pointed to the pocket which had held the packet.\\n\\nSonia started back with an air of utter dismay; her eyes glanced wildly\\nround the room as if seeking an avenue of escape; her fingers closed\\nconvulsively on the pocket.\\n\\n“But this is abominable!” she cried. “You look as if—”\\n\\n“I beg you, mademoiselle,” interrupted Guerchard. “We are sometimes\\nobliged—”\\n\\n“Really, Mademoiselle Sonia,” broke in the Duke, in a singularly clear\\nand piercing tone, “I cannot see why you should object to this mere\\nformality.”\\n\\n“Oh, but—but—” gasped Sonia, raising her terror-stricken eyes to his.\\n\\nThe Duke seemed to hold them with his own; and he said in the same\\nclear, piercing voice, “There isn’t the slightest reason for you to be\\nfrightened.”\\n\\nSonia let go of the cloak, and Guerchard, his face all alight with\\ntriumph, plunged his hand into the pocket. He drew it out empty, and\\nstared at it, while his face fell to an utter, amazed blankness.\\n\\n“Nothing? nothing?” he muttered under his breath. And he stared at his\\nempty hand as if he could not believe his eyes.\\n\\nBy a violent effort he forced an apologetic smile on his face, and said\\nto Sonia: “A thousand apologies, mademoiselle.”\\n\\nHe handed the cloak to her. Sonia took it and turned to go. She took a\\nstep towards the door, and tottered.\\n\\nThe Duke sprang forward and caught her as she was falling.\\n\\n“Do you feel faint?” he said in an anxious voice.\\n\\n“Thank you, you just saved me in time,” muttered Sonia.\\n\\n“I’m really very sorry,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Thank you, it was nothing. I’m all right now,” said Sonia, releasing\\nherself from the Duke’s supporting arm.\\n\\nShe drew herself up, and walked quietly out of the room.\\n\\nGuerchard went back to M. Formery at the writing-table.\\n\\n“You made a clumsy mistake there, Guerchard,” said M. Formery, with a\\ntouch of gratified malice in his tone.\\n\\nGuerchard took no notice of it: “I want you to give orders that nobody\\nleaves the house without my permission,” he said, in a low voice.\\n\\n“No one except Mademoiselle Kritchnoff, I suppose,” said M. Formery,\\nsmiling.\\n\\n“She less than any one,” said Guerchard quickly.\\n\\n“I don’t understand what you’re driving at a bit,” said M. Formery.\\n“Unless you suppose that Mademoiselle Kritchnoff is Lupin in disguise.”\\n\\nGuerchard laughed softly: “You will have your joke, M. Formery,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\n“Well, well, I’ll give the order,” said M. Formery, somewhat mollified\\nby the tribute to his humour.\\n\\nHe called the inspector to him and whispered a word in his ear. Then he\\nrose and said: “I think, gentlemen, we ought to go and examine the\\nbedrooms, and, above all, make sure that the safe in M.\\nGournay-Martin’s bedroom has not been tampered with.”\\n\\n“I was wondering how much longer we were going to waste time here\\ntalking about that stupid pendant,” grumbled the millionaire; and he\\nrose and led the way.\\n\\n“There may also be some jewel-cases in the bedrooms,” said M. Formery.\\n“There are all the wedding presents. They were in charge of Victoire.”\\nsaid Germaine quickly. “It would be dreadful if they had been stolen.\\nSome of them are from the first families in France.”\\n\\n“They would replace them ... those paper-knives,” said the Duke,\\nsmiling.\\n\\nGermaine and her father led the way. M. Formery, Guerchard, and the\\ninspector followed them. At the door the Duke paused, stopped, closed\\nit on them softly. He came back to the window, put his hand in his\\npocket, and drew out the packet wrapped in tissue-paper.\\n\\nHe unfolded the paper with slow, reluctant fingers, and revealed the\\npendant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\nLUPIN WIRES\\n\\n\\nThe Duke stared at the pendant, his eyes full of wonder and pity.\\n\\n“Poor little girl!” he said softly under his breath.\\n\\nHe put the pendant carefully away in his waistcoat-pocket and stood\\nstaring thoughtfully out of the window.\\n\\nThe door opened softly, and Sonia came quickly into the room, closed\\nthe door, and leaned back against it. Her face was a dead white; her\\nskin had lost its lustre of fine porcelain, and she stared at him with\\neyes dim with anguish.\\n\\nIn a hoarse, broken voice, she muttered: “Forgive me! Oh, forgive me!”\\n\\n“A thief—you?” said the Duke, in a tone of pitying wonder.\\n\\nSonia groaned.\\n\\n“You mustn’t stop here,” said the Duke in an uneasy tone, and he looked\\nuneasily at the door.\\n\\n“Ah, you don’t want to speak to me any more,” said Sonia, in a\\nheartrending tone, wringing her hands.\\n\\n“Guerchard is suspicious of everything. It is dangerous for us to be\\ntalking here. I assure you that it’s dangerous,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“What an opinion must you have of me! It’s dreadful—cruel!” wailed\\nSonia.\\n\\n“For goodness’ sake don’t speak so loud,” said the Duke, with even\\ngreater uneasiness. “You MUST think of Guerchard.”\\n\\n“What do I care?” cried Sonia. “I’ve lost the liking of the only\\ncreature whose liking I wanted. What does anything else matter? What\\nDOES it matter?”\\n\\n“We’ll talk somewhere else presently. That’ll be far safer,” said the\\nDuke.\\n\\n“No, no, we must talk now!” cried Sonia. “You must know.... I must tell\\n... Oh, dear! ... Oh, dear! ... I don’t know how to tell you.... And\\nthen it is so unfair.... she ... Germaine ... she has everything,” she\\npanted. “Yesterday, before me, you gave her that pendant, ... she\\nsmiled ... she was proud of it.... I saw her pleasure.... Then I took\\nit—I took it—I took it! And if I could, I’d take her fortune, too.... I\\nhate her! Oh, how I hate her!”\\n\\n“What!” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes, I do ... I hate her!” said Sonia; and her eyes, no longer gentle,\\nglowed with the sombre resentment, the dull rage of the weak who turn\\non Fortune. Her gentle voice was harsh with rebellious wrath.\\n\\n“You hate her?” said the Duke quickly.\\n\\n“I should never have told you that.... But now I dare.... I dare speak\\nout.... It’s you! ... It’s you—” The avowal died on her lips. A burning\\nflush crimsoned her cheeks and faded as quickly as it came: “I hate\\nher!” she muttered.\\n\\n“Sonia—” said the Duke gently.\\n\\n“Oh! I know that it’s no excuse.... I know that you’re thinking ‘This\\nis a very pretty story, but it’s not her first theft’; ... and it’s\\ntrue—it’s the tenth, ... perhaps it’s the twentieth.... It’s true—I am\\na thief.” She paused, and the glow deepened in her eyes. “But there’s\\none thing you must believe—you shall believe; since you came, since\\nI’ve known you, since the first day you set eyes on me, I have stolen\\nno more ... till yesterday when you gave her the pendant before me. I\\ncould not bear it ... I could not.” She paused and looked at him with\\neyes that demanded an assent.\\n\\n“I believe you,” said the Duke gravely.\\n\\nShe heaved a deep sigh of relief, and went on more quietly—some of its\\ngolden tone had returned to her voice: “And then, if you knew how it\\nbegan ... the horror of it,” she said.\\n\\n“Poor child!” said the Duke softly.\\n\\n“Yes, you pity me, but you despise me—you despise me beyond words. You\\nshall not! I will not have it!” she cried fiercely.\\n\\n“Believe me, no,” said the Duke, in a soothing tone.\\n\\n“Listen,” said Sonia. “Have you ever been alone—alone in the world? ...\\nHave you ever been hungry? Think of it ... in this big city where I was\\nstarving in sight of bread ... bread in the shops .... One only had to\\nstretch out one’s hand to touch it ... a penny loaf. Oh, it’s\\ncommonplace!” she broke off: “quite commonplace!”\\n\\n“Go on: tell me,” said the Duke curtly.\\n\\n“There was one way I could make money and I would not do it: no, I\\nwould not,” she went on. “But that day I was dying ... understand, I\\nwas dying ....I went to the rooms of a man I knew a little. It was my\\nlast resource. At first I was glad ... he gave me food and wine ... and\\nthen, he talked to me ... he offered me money.”\\n\\n“What!” cried the Duke; and a sudden flame of anger flared up in his\\neyes.\\n\\n“No; I could not ... and then I robbed him.... I preferred to ... it\\nwas more decent. Ah, I had excuses then. I began to steal to remain an\\nhonest woman ... and I’ve gone on stealing to keep up appearances. You\\nsee ... I joke about it.” And she laughed, the faint, dreadful, mocking\\nlaugh of a damned soul. “Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” she cried; and, burying\\nher face in her hands, she burst into a storm of weeping.\\n\\n“Poor child,” said the Duke softly. And he stared gloomily on the\\nground, overcome by this revelation of the tortures of the feeble in\\nthe underworld beneath the Paris he knew.\\n\\n“Oh, you do pity me ... you do understand ... and feel,” said Sonia,\\nbetween her sobs.\\n\\nThe Duke raised his head and gazed at her with eyes full of an infinite\\nsympathy and compassion.\\n\\n“Poor little Sonia,” he said gently. “I understand.”\\n\\nShe gazed at him with incredulous eyes, in which joy and despair\\nmingled, struggling.\\n\\nHe came slowly towards her, and stopped short. His quick ear had caught\\nthe sound of a footstep outside the door.\\n\\n“Quick! Dry your eyes! You must look composed. The other room!” he\\ncried, in an imperative tone.\\n\\nHe caught her hand and drew her swiftly into the further drawing-room.\\n\\nWith the quickness which came of long practice in hiding her feelings\\nSonia composed her face to something of its usual gentle calm. There\\nwas even a faint tinge of colour in her cheeks; they had lost their\\ndead whiteness. A faint light shone in her eyes; the anguish had\\ncleared from them. They rested on the Duke with a look of ineffable\\ngratitude. She sat down on a couch. The Duke went to the window and\\nlighted a cigarette. They heard the door of the outer drawing-room\\nopen, and there was a pause. Quick footsteps crossed the room, and\\nGuerchard stood in the doorway. He looked from one to the other with\\nkeen and eager eyes. Sonia sat staring rather listlessly at the carpet.\\nThe Duke turned, and smiled at him.\\n\\n“Well, M. Guerchard,” he said. “I hope the burglars have not stolen the\\ncoronet.”\\n\\n“The coronet is safe, your Grace,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“And the paper-knives?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“The paper-knives?” said Guerchard with an inquiring air.\\n\\n“The wedding presents,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes, your Grace, the wedding presents are safe,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“I breathe again,” said the Duke languidly.\\n\\nGuerchard turned to Sonia and said, “I was looking for you,\\nMademoiselle, to tell you that M. Formery has changed his mind. It is\\nimpossible for you to go out. No one will be allowed to go out.”\\n\\n“Yes?” said Sonia, in an indifferent tone.\\n\\n“We should be very much obliged if you would go to your room,” said\\nGuerchard. “Your meals will be sent up to you.”\\n\\n“What?” said Sonia, rising quickly; and she looked from Guerchard to\\nthe Duke. The Duke gave her the faintest nod.\\n\\n“Very well, I will go to my room,” she said coldly.\\n\\nThey accompanied her to the door of the outer drawing-room. Guerchard\\nopened it for her and closed it after her.\\n\\n“Really, M. Guerchard,” said the Duke, shrugging his shoulders. “This\\nlast measure—a child like that!”\\n\\n“Really, I’m very sorry, your Grace; but it’s my trade, or, if you\\nprefer it, my duty. As long as things are taking place here which I am\\nstill the only one to perceive, and which are not yet clear to me, I\\nmust neglect no precaution.”\\n\\n“Of course, you know best,” said the Duke. “But still, a child like\\nthat—you’re frightening her out of her life.”\\n\\nGuerchard shrugged his shoulders, and went quietly out of the room.\\n\\nThe Duke sat down in an easy chair, frowning and thoughtful. Suddenly\\nthere struck on his ears the sound of a loud roaring and heavy bumping\\non the stairs, the door flew open, and M. Gournay-Martin stood on the\\nthreshold waving a telegram in his hand.\\n\\nM. Formery and the inspector came hurrying down the stairs behind him,\\nand watched his emotion with astonished and wondering eyes.\\n\\n“Here!” bellowed the millionaire. “A telegram! A telegram from the\\nscoundrel himself! Listen! Just listen:”\\n\\n“A thousand apologies for not having been able to keep my promise about\\nthe coronet. Had an appointment at the Acacias. Please have coronet\\nready in your room to-night. Will come without fail to fetch it,\\nbetween a quarter to twelve and twelve o’clock.”\\n\\n“Yours affectionately,”\\n“ARSÈNE LUPIN.”\\n\\n\\n“There! What do you think of that?”\\n\\n“If you ask me, I think he’s humbug,” said the Duke with conviction.\\n\\n“Humbug! You always think it’s humbug! You thought the letter was\\nhumbug; and look what has happened!” cried the millionaire.\\n\\n“Give me the telegram, please,” said M. Formery quickly.\\n\\nThe millionaire gave it to him; and he read it through.\\n\\n“Find out who brought it, inspector,” he said.\\n\\nThe inspector hurried to the top of the staircase and called to the\\npoliceman in charge of the front door. He came back to the drawing-room\\nand said: “It was brought by an ordinary post-office messenger, sir.”\\n\\n“Where is he?” said M. Formery. “Why did you let him go?”\\n\\n“Shall I send for him, sir?” said the inspector.\\n\\n“No, no, it doesn’t matter,” said M. Formery; and, turning to M.\\nGournay-Martin and the Duke, he said, “Now we’re really going to have\\ntrouble with Guerchard. He is going to muddle up everything. This\\ntelegram will be the last straw. Nothing will persuade him now that\\nthis is not Lupin’s work. And just consider, gentlemen: if Lupin had\\ncome last night, and if he had really set his heart on the coronet, he\\nwould have stolen it then, or at any rate he would have tried to open\\nthe safe in M. Gournay-Martin’s bedroom, in which the coronet actually\\nis, or this safe here”—he went to the safe and rapped on the door of\\nit—“in which is the second key.”\\n\\n“That’s quite clear,” said the inspector.\\n\\n“If, then, he did not make the attempt last night, when he had a clear\\nfield—when the house was empty—he certainly will not make the attempt\\nnow when we are warned, when the police are on the spot, and the house\\nis surrounded. The idea is childish, gentlemen”—he leaned against the\\ndoor of the safe—“absolutely childish, but Guerchard is mad on this\\npoint; and I foresee that his madness is going to hamper us in the most\\nidiotic way.”\\n\\nHe suddenly pitched forward into the middle of the room, as the door of\\nthe safe opened with a jerk, and Guerchard shot out of it.\\n\\n“What the devil!” cried M. Formery, gaping at him.\\n\\n“You’d be surprised how clearly you hear everything in these\\nsafes—you’d think they were too thick,” said Guerchard, in his gentle,\\nhusky voice.\\n\\n“How on earth did you get into it?” cried M. Formery.\\n\\n“Getting in was easy enough. It’s the getting out that was awkward.\\nThese jokers had fixed up some kind of a spring so that I nearly shot\\nout with the door,” said Guerchard, rubbing his elbow.\\n\\n“But how did you get into it? How the deuce DID you get into it?” cried\\nM. Formery.\\n\\n“Through the little cabinet into which that door behind the safe opens.\\nThere’s no longer any back to the safe; they’ve cut it clean out of\\nit—a very neat piece of work. Safes like this should always be fixed\\nagainst a wall, not stuck in front of a door. The backs of them are\\nalways the weak point.”\\n\\n“And the key? The key of the safe upstairs, in my bedroom, where the\\ncoronet is—is the key there?” cried M. Gournay-Martin.\\n\\nGuerchard went back into the empty safe, and groped about in it. He\\ncame out smiling.\\n\\n“Well, have you found the key?” cried the millionaire.\\n\\n“No. I haven’t; but I’ve found something better,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“What is it?” said M. Formery sharply.\\n\\n“I’ll give you a hundred guesses,” said Guerchard with a tantalizing\\nsmile.\\n\\n“What is it?” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“A little present for you,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” cried M. Formery angrily.\\n\\nGuerchard held up a card between his thumb and forefinger and said\\nquietly:\\n\\n“The card of Arsène Lupin.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\nGUERCHARD PICKS UP THE TRUE SCENT\\n\\n\\nThe millionaire gazed at the card with stupefied eyes, the inspector\\ngazed at it with extreme intelligence, the Duke gazed at it with\\ninterest, and M. Formery gazed at it with extreme disgust.\\n\\n“It’s part of the same ruse—it was put there to throw us off the scent.\\nIt proves nothing—absolutely nothing,” he said scornfully.\\n\\n“No; it proves nothing at all,” said Guerchard quietly.\\n\\n“The telegram is the important thing—this telegram,” said M.\\nGournay-Martin feverishly. “It concerns the coronet. Is it going to be\\ndisregarded?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, no,” said M. Formery in a soothing tone. “It will be taken\\ninto account. It will certainly be taken into account.”\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin’s butler appeared in the doorway of the drawing-room:\\n“If you please, sir, lunch is served,” he said.\\n\\nAt the tidings some of his weight of woe appeared to be lifted from the\\nhead of the millionaire. “Good!” he said, “good! Gentlemen, you will\\nlunch with me, I hope.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said M. Formery. “There is nothing else for us to do, at\\nany rate at present, and in the house. I am not quite satisfied about\\nMademoiselle Kritchnoff—at least Guerchard is not. I propose to\\nquestion her again—about those earlier thefts.”\\n\\n“I’m sure there’s nothing in that,” said the Duke quickly.\\n\\n“No, no; I don’t think there is,” said M. Formery. “But still one never\\nknows from what quarter light may come in an affair like this. Accident\\noften gives us our best clues.”\\n\\n“It seems rather a shame to frighten her—she’s such a child,” said the\\nDuke.\\n\\n“Oh, I shall be gentle, your Grace—as gentle as possible, that is. But\\nI look to get more from the examination of Victoire. She was on the\\nscene. She has actually seen the rogues at work; but till she recovers\\nthere is nothing more to be done, except to wait the discoveries of the\\ndetectives who are working outside; and they will report here. So in\\nthe meantime we shall be charmed to lunch with you, M. Gournay-Martin.”\\n\\nThey went downstairs to the dining-room and found an elaborate and\\nluxurious lunch, worthy of the hospitality of a millionaire, awaiting\\nthem. The skill of the cook seemed to have been quite unaffected by the\\nlosses of his master. M. Formery, an ardent lover of good things,\\nenjoyed himself immensely. He was in the highest spirits. Germaine, a\\nlittle upset by the night-journey, was rather querulous. Her father was\\nplunged in a gloom which lifted for but a brief space at the appearance\\nof a fresh delicacy. Guerchard ate and drank seriously, answering the\\nquestions of the Duke in a somewhat absent-minded fashion. The Duke\\nhimself seemed to have lost his usual flow of good spirits, and at\\ntimes his brow was knitted in an anxious frown. His questions to\\nGuerchard showed a far less keen interest in the affair.\\n\\nTo him the lunch seemed very long and very tedious; but at last it came\\nto an end. M. Gournay-Martin seemed to have been much cheered by the\\nwine he had drunk. He was almost hopeful. M. Formery, who had not by\\nany means trifled with the champagne, was raised to the very height of\\nsanguine certainty. Their coffee and liqueurs were served in the\\nsmoking-room. Guerchard lighted a cigar, refused a liqueur, drank his\\ncoffee quickly, and slipped out of the room.\\n\\nThe Duke followed him, and in the hall said: “I will continue to watch\\nyou unravel the threads of this mystery, if I may, M. Guerchard.”\\n\\nGood Republican as Guerchard was, he could not help feeling flattered\\nby the interest of a Duke; and the excellent lunch he had eaten\\ndisposed him to feel the honour even more deeply.\\n\\n“I shall be charmed,” he said. “To tell the truth, I find the company\\nof your Grace really quite stimulating.”\\n\\n“It must be because I find it all so extremely interesting,” said the\\nDuke.\\n\\nThey went up to the drawing-room and found the red-faced young\\npoliceman seated on a chair by the door eating a lunch, which had been\\nsent up to him from the millionaire’s kitchen, with a very hearty\\nappetite.\\n\\nThey went into the drawing-room. Guerchard shut the door and turned the\\nkey: “Now,” he said, “I think that M. Formery will give me half an hour\\nto myself. His cigar ought to last him at least half an hour. In that\\ntime I shall know what the burglars really did with their plunder—at\\nleast I shall know for certain how they got it out of the house.”\\n\\n“Please explain,” said the Duke. “I thought we knew how they got it out\\nof the house.” And he waved his hand towards the window.\\n\\n“Oh, that!—that’s childish,” said Guerchard contemptuously. “Those are\\ntraces for an examining magistrate. The ladder, the table on the\\nwindow-sill, they lead nowhere. The only people who came up that ladder\\nwere the two men who brought it from the scaffolding. You can see their\\nfootsteps. Nobody went down it at all. It was mere waste of time to\\nbother with those traces.”\\n\\n“But the footprint under the book?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, that,” said Guerchard. “One of the burglars sat on the couch\\nthere, rubbed plaster on the sole of his boot, and set his foot down on\\nthe carpet. Then he dusted the rest of the plaster off his boot and put\\nthe book on the top of the footprint.”\\n\\n“Now, how do you know that?” said the astonished Duke.\\n\\n“It’s as plain as a pike-staff,” said Guerchard. “There must have been\\nseveral burglars to move such pieces of furniture. If the soles of all\\nof them had been covered with plaster, all the sweeping in the world\\nwould not have cleared the carpet of the tiny fragments of it. I’ve\\nbeen over the carpet between the footprint and the window with a\\nmagnifying glass. There are no fragments of plaster on it. We dismiss\\nthe footprint. It is a mere blind, and a very fair blind too—for an\\nexamining magistrate.”\\n\\n“I understand,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“That narrows the problem, the quite simple problem, how was the\\nfurniture taken out of the room. It did not go through that window down\\nthe ladder. Again, it was not taken down the stairs, and out of the\\nfront door, or the back. If it had been, the concierge and his wife\\nwould have heard the noise. Besides that, it would have been carried\\ndown into a main street, in which there are people at all hours.\\nSomebody would have been sure to tell a policeman that this house was\\nbeing emptied. Moreover, the police were continually patrolling the\\nmain streets, and, quickly as a man like Lupin would do the job, he\\ncould not do it so quickly that a policeman would not have seen it. No;\\nthe furniture was not taken down the stairs or out of the front door.\\nThat narrows the problem still more. In fact, there is only one mode of\\negress left.”\\n\\n“The chimney!” cried the Duke.\\n\\n“You’ve hit it,” said Guerchard, with a husky laugh. “By that\\nwell-known logical process, the process of elimination, we’ve excluded\\nall methods of egress except the chimney.”\\n\\nHe paused, frowning, in some perplexity; and then he said uneasily:\\n“What I don’t like about it is that Victoire was set in the fireplace.\\nI asked myself at once what was she doing there. It was unnecessary\\nthat she should be drugged and set in the fireplace—quite unnecessary.”\\n\\n“It might have been to put off an examining magistrate,” said the Duke.\\n“Having found Victoire in the fireplace, M. Formery did not look for\\nanything else.”\\n\\n“Yes, it might have been that,” said Guerchard slowly. “On the other\\nhand, she might have been put there to make sure that I did not miss\\nthe road the burglars took. That’s the worst of having to do with\\nLupin. He knows me to the bottom of my mind. He has something up his\\nsleeve—some surprise for me. Even now, I’m nowhere near the bottom of\\nthe mystery. But come along, we’ll take the road the burglars took. The\\ninspector has put my lantern ready for me.”\\n\\nAs he spoke he went to the fireplace, picked up a lantern which had\\nbeen set on the top of the iron fire-basket, and lighted it. The Duke\\nstepped into the great fireplace beside him. It was four feet deep, and\\nbetween eight and nine feet broad. Guerchard threw the light from the\\nlantern on to the back wall of it. Six feet from the floor the soot\\nfrom the fire stopped abruptly, and there was a dappled patch of\\nbricks, half of them clean and red, half of them blackened by soot,\\nfive feet broad, and four feet high.\\n\\n“The opening is higher up than I thought,” said Guerchard. “I must get\\na pair of steps.”\\n\\nHe went to the door of the drawing-room and bade the young policeman\\nfetch him a pair of steps. They were brought quickly. He took them from\\nthe policeman, shut the door, and locked it again. He set the steps in\\nthe fireplace and mounted them.\\n\\n“Be careful,” he said to the Duke, who had followed him into the\\nfireplace, and stood at the foot of the steps. “Some of these bricks\\nmay drop inside, and they’ll sting you up if they fall on your toes.”\\n\\nThe Duke stepped back out of reach of any bricks that might fall.\\n\\nGuerchard set his left hand against the wall of the chimney-piece\\nbetween him and the drawing-room, and pressed hard with his right\\nagainst the top of the dappled patch of bricks. At the first push, half\\na dozen of them fell with a bang on to the floor of the next house. The\\nlight came flooding in through the hole, and shone on Guerchard’s face\\nand its smile of satisfaction. Quickly he pushed row after row of\\nbricks into the next house until he had cleared an opening four feet\\nsquare.\\n\\n“Come along,” he said to the Duke, and disappeared feet foremost\\nthrough the opening.\\n\\nThe Duke mounted the steps, and found himself looking into a large\\nempty room of the exact size and shape of the drawing-room of M.\\nGournay-Martin, save that it had an ordinary modern fireplace instead\\nof one of the antique pattern of that in which he stood. Its\\nchimney-piece was a few inches below the opening. He stepped out on to\\nthe chimney-piece and dropped lightly to the floor.\\n\\n“Well,” he said, looking back at the opening through which he had come.\\n“That’s an ingenious dodge.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s common enough,” said Guerchard. “Robberies at the big\\njewellers’ are sometimes worked by these means. But what is uncommon\\nabout it, and what at first sight put me off the track, is that these\\nburglars had the cheek to pierce the wall with an opening large enough\\nto enable them to remove the furniture of a house.”\\n\\n“It’s true,” said the Duke. “The opening’s as large as a good-sized\\nwindow. Those burglars seem capable of everything—even of a first-class\\npiece of mason’s work.”\\n\\n“Oh, this has all been prepared a long while ago. But now I’m really on\\ntheir track. And after all, I haven’t really lost any time. Dieusy\\nwasted no time in making inquiries in Sureau Street; he’s been working\\nall this side of the house.”\\n\\nGuerchard drew up the blinds, opened the shutters, and let the daylight\\nflood the dim room. He came back to the fireplace and looked down at\\nthe heap of bricks, frowning:\\n\\n“I made a mistake there,” he said. “I ought to have taken those bricks\\ndown carefully, one by one.”\\n\\nQuickly he took brick after brick from the pile, and began to range\\nthem neatly against the wall on the left. The Duke watched him for two\\nor three minutes, then began to help him. It did not take them long,\\nand under one of the last few bricks Guerchard found a fragment of a\\ngilded picture-frame.\\n\\n“Here’s where they ought to have done their sweeping,” he said, holding\\nit up to the Duke.\\n\\n“I tell you what,” said the Duke, “I shouldn’t wonder if we found the\\nfurniture in this house still.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, no!” said Guerchard. “I tell you that Lupin would allow for\\nmyself or Ganimard being put in charge of the case; and he would know\\nthat we should find the opening in the chimney. The furniture was taken\\nstraight out into the side-street on to which this house opens.” He led\\nthe way out of the room on to the landing and went down the dark\\nstaircase into the hall. He opened the shutters of the hall windows,\\nand let in the light. Then he examined the hall. The dust lay thick on\\nthe tiled floor. Down the middle of it was a lane formed by many feet.\\nThe footprints were faint, but still plain in the layer of dust.\\nGuerchard came back to the stairs and began to examine them. Half-way\\nup the flight he stooped, and picked up a little spray of flowers:\\n“Fresh!” he said. “These have not been long plucked.”\\n\\n“Salvias,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Salvias they are,” said Guerchard. “Pink salvias; and there is only\\none gardener in France who has ever succeeded in getting this shade—M.\\nGournay-Martin’s gardener at Charmerace. I’m a gardener myself.”\\n\\n“Well, then, last night’s burglars came from Charmerace. They must\\nhave,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“It looks like it,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“The Charolais,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“It looks like it,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“It must be,” said the Duke. “This IS interesting—if only we could get\\nan absolute proof.”\\n\\n“We shall get one presently,” said Guerchard confidently.\\n\\n“It is interesting,” said the Duke in a tone of lively enthusiasm.\\n“These clues—these tracks which cross one another—each fact by degrees\\nfalling into its proper place—extraordinarily interesting.” He paused\\nand took out his cigarette-case: “Will you have a cigarette?” he said.\\n\\n“Are they caporal?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“No, Egyptians—Mercedes.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Guerchard; and he took one.\\n\\nThe Duke struck a match, lighted Guerchard’s cigarette, and then his\\nown:\\n\\n“Yes, it’s very interesting,” he said. “In the last quarter of an hour\\nyou’ve practically discovered that the burglars came from\\nCharmerace—that they were the Charolais—that they came in by the front\\ndoor of this house, and carried the furniture out of it.”\\n\\n“I don’t know about their coming in by it,” said Guerchard. “Unless I’m\\nvery much mistaken, they came in by the front door of M.\\nGournay-Martin’s house.”\\n\\n“Of course,” said the Duke. “I was forgetting. They brought the keys\\nfrom Charmerace.”\\n\\n“Yes, but who drew the bolts for them?” said Guerchard. “The concierge\\nbolted them before he went to bed. He told me so. He was telling the\\ntruth—I know when that kind of man is telling the truth.”\\n\\n“By Jove!” said the Duke softly. “You mean that they had an\\naccomplice?”\\n\\n“I think we shall find that they had an accomplice. But your Grace is\\nbeginning to draw inferences with uncommon quickness. I believe that\\nyou would make a first-class detective yourself—with practice, of\\ncourse—with practice.”\\n\\n“Can I have missed my true career?” said the Duke, smiling. “It’s\\ncertainly a very interesting game.”\\n\\n“Well, I’m not going to search this barracks myself,” said Guerchard.\\n“I’ll send in a couple of men to do it; but I’ll just take a look at\\nthe steps myself.”\\n\\nSo saying, he opened the front door and went out and examined the steps\\ncarefully.\\n\\n“We shall have to go back the way we came,” he said, when he had\\nfinished his examination. “The drawing-room door is locked. We ought to\\nfind M. Formery hammering on it.” And he smiled as if he found the\\nthought pleasing.\\n\\nThey went back up the stairs, through the opening, into the\\ndrawing-room of M. Gournay-Martin’s house. Sure enough, from the other\\nside of the locked door came the excited voice of M. Formery, crying:\\n\\n“Guerchard! Guerchard! What are you doing? Let me in! Why don’t you let\\nme in?”\\n\\nGuerchard unlocked the door; and in bounced M. Formery, very excited,\\nvery red in the face.\\n\\n“Hang it all, Guerchard! What on earth have you been doing?” he cried.\\n“Why didn’t you open the door when I knocked?”\\n\\n“I didn’t hear you,” said Guerchard. “I wasn’t in the room.”\\n\\n“Then where on earth have you been?” cried M. Formery.\\n\\nGuerchard looked at him with a faint, ironical smile, and said in his\\ngentle voice, “I was following the real track of the burglars.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\nTHE EXAMINATION OF SONIA\\n\\n\\nM. Formery gasped: “The real track?” he muttered.\\n\\n“Let me show you,” said Guerchard. And he led him to the fireplace, and\\nshowed him the opening between the two houses.\\n\\n“I must go into this myself!” cried M. Formery in wild excitement.\\n\\nWithout more ado he began to mount the steps. Guerchard followed him.\\nThe Duke saw their heels disappear up the steps. Then he came out of\\nthe drawing-room and inquired for M. Gournay-Martin. He was told that\\nthe millionaire was up in his bedroom; and he went upstairs, and\\nknocked at the door of it.\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin bade him enter in a very faint voice, and the Duke\\nfound him lying on the bed. He was looking depressed, even exhausted,\\nthe shadow of the blusterous Gournay-Martin of the day before. The rich\\nrosiness of his cheeks had faded to a moderate rose-pink.\\n\\n“That telegram,” moaned the millionaire. “It was the last straw. It has\\noverwhelmed me. The coronet is lost.”\\n\\n“What, already?” said the Duke, in a tone of the liveliest surprise.\\n\\n“No, no; it’s still in the safe,” said the millionaire. “But it’s as\\ngood as lost—before midnight it will be lost. That fiend will get it.”\\n\\n“If it’s in this safe now, it won’t be lost before midnight,” said the\\nDuke. “But are you sure it’s there now?”\\n\\n“Look for yourself,” said the millionaire, taking the key of the safe\\nfrom his waistcoat pocket, and handing it to the Duke.\\n\\nThe Duke opened the safe. The morocco case which held the coronet lay\\non the middle shell in front of him. He glanced at the millionaire, and\\nsaw that he had closed his eyes in the exhaustion of despair. Whistling\\nsoftly, the Duke opened the case, took out the diadem, and examined it\\ncarefully, admiring its admirable workmanship. He put it back in the\\ncase, turned to the millionaire, and said thoughtfully:\\n\\n“I can never make up my mind, in the case of one of these old diadems,\\nwhether one ought not to take out the stones and have them re-cut. Look\\nat this emerald now. It’s a very fine stone, but this old-fashioned\\ncutting does not really do it justice.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, no: you should never interfere with an antique, historic piece\\nof jewellery. Any alteration decreases its value—its value as an\\nhistoric relic,” cried the millionaire, in a shocked tone.\\n\\n“I know that,” said the Duke, “but the question for me is, whether one\\nought not to sacrifice some of its value to increasing its beauty.”\\n\\n“You do have such mad ideas,” said the millionaire, in a tone of\\npeevish exasperation.\\n\\n“Ah, well, it’s a nice question,” said the Duke.\\n\\nHe snapped the case briskly, put it back on the shelf, locked the safe,\\nand handed the key to the millionaire. Then he strolled across the room\\nand looked down into the street, whistling softly.\\n\\n“I think—I think—I’ll go home and get out of these motoring clothes.\\nAnd I should like to have on a pair of boots that were a trifle less\\nmuddy,” he said slowly.\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin sat up with a jerk and cried, “For Heaven’s sake,\\ndon’t you go and desert me, my dear chap! You don’t know what my nerves\\nare like!”\\n\\n“Oh, you’ve got that sleuth-hound, Guerchard, and the splendid Formery,\\nand four other detectives, and half a dozen ordinary policemen guarding\\nyou. You can do without my feeble arm. Besides, I shan’t be gone more\\nthan half an hour—three-quarters at the outside. I’ll bring back my\\nevening clothes with me, and dress for dinner here. I don’t suppose\\nthat anything fresh will happen between now and midnight; but I want to\\nbe on the spot, and hear the information as it comes in fresh. Besides,\\nthere’s Guerchard. I positively cling to Guerchard. It’s an education,\\nthough perhaps not a liberal education, to go about with him,” said the\\nDuke; and there was a sub-acid irony in his voice.\\n\\n“Well, if you must, you must,” said M. Gournay-Martin grumpily.\\n\\n“Good-bye for the present, then,” said the Duke. And he went out of the\\nroom and down the stairs. He took his motor-cap from the hall-table,\\nand had his hand on the latch of the door, when the policeman in charge\\nof it said, “I beg your pardon, sir, but have you M. Guerchard’s\\npermission to leave the house?”\\n\\n“M. Guerchard’s permission?” said the Duke haughtily. “What has M.\\nGuerchard to do with me? I am the Duke of Charmerace.” And he opened\\nthe door.\\n\\n“It was M. Formery’s orders, your Grace,” stammered the policeman\\ndoubtfully.\\n\\n“M. Formery’s orders?” said the Duke, standing on the top step. “Call\\nme a taxi-cab, please.”\\n\\nThe concierge, who stood beside the policeman, ran down the steps and\\nblew his whistle. The policeman gazed uneasily at the Duke, shifting\\nhis weight from one foot to the other; but he said no more.\\n\\nA taxi-cab came up to the door, the Duke went down the steps, stepped\\ninto it, and drove away.\\n\\nThree-quarters of an hour later he came back, having changed into\\nclothes more suited to a Paris drawing-room. He went up to the\\ndrawing-room, and there he found Guerchard, M. Formery, and the\\ninspector, who had just completed their tour of inspection of the house\\nnext door and had satisfied themselves that the stolen treasures were\\nnot in it. The inspector and his men had searched it thoroughly just to\\nmake sure; but, as Guerchard had foretold, the burglars had not taken\\nthe chance of the failure of the police to discover the opening between\\nthe two houses. M. Formery told the Duke about their tour of inspection\\nat length. Guerchard went to the telephone and told the exchange to put\\nhim through to Charmerace. He was informed that the trunk line was very\\nbusy and that he might have to wait half an hour.\\n\\nThe Duke inquired if any trace of the burglars, after they had left\\nwith their booty, had yet been found. M. Formery told him that, so far,\\nthe detectives had failed to find a single trace. Guerchard said that\\nhe had three men at work on the search, and that he was hopeful of\\ngetting some news before long.\\n\\n“The layman is impatient in these matters,” said M. Formery, with an\\nindulgent smile. “But we have learnt to be patient, after long\\nexperience.”\\n\\nHe proceeded to discuss with Guerchard the new theories with which the\\ndiscovery of the afternoon had filled his mind. None of them struck the\\nDuke as being of great value, and he listened to them with a somewhat\\nabsent-minded air. The coming examination of Sonia weighed heavily on\\nhis spirit. Guerchard answered only in monosyllables to the questions\\nand suggestions thrown out by M. Formery. It seemed to the Duke that he\\npaid very little attention to him, that his mind was still working hard\\non the solution of the mystery, seeking the missing facts which would\\nbring him to the bottom of it. In the middle of one of M. Formery’s\\nmore elaborate dissertations the telephone bell rang.\\n\\nGuerchard rose hastily and went to it. They heard him say: “Is that\\nCharmerace? ... I want the gardener.... Out? When will he be back? ...\\nTell him to ring me up at M. Gournay-Martin’s house in Paris the moment\\nhe gets back.... Detective-Inspector Guerchard ... Guerchard ...\\nDetective-Inspector.”\\n\\nHe turned to them with a frown, and said, “Of course, since I want him,\\nthe confounded gardener has gone out for the day. Still, it’s of very\\nlittle importance—a mere corroboration I wanted.” And he went back to\\nhis seat and lighted another cigarette.\\n\\nM. Formery continued his dissertation. Presently Guerchard said, “You\\nmight go and see how Victoire is, inspector—whether she shows any signs\\nof waking. What did the doctor say?”\\n\\n“The doctor said that she would not really be sensible and have her\\nfull wits about her much before ten o’clock to-night,” said the\\ninspector; but he went to examine her present condition.\\n\\nM. Formery proceeded to discuss the effects of different anesthetics.\\nThe others heard him with very little attention.\\n\\nThe inspector came back and reported that Victoire showed no signs of\\nawaking.\\n\\n“Well, then, M. Formery, I think we might get on with the examination\\nof Mademoiselle Kritchnoff,” said Guerchard. “Will you go and fetch\\nher, inspector?”\\n\\n“Really, I cannot conceive why you should worry that poor child,” the\\nDuke protested, in a tone of some indignation.\\n\\n“It seems to me hardly necessary,” said M. Formery.\\n\\n“Excuse me,” said Guerchard suavely, “but I attach considerable\\nimportance to it. It seems to me to be our bounden duty to question her\\nfully. One never knows from what quarter light may come.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, since you make such a point of it,” said M. Formery.\\n“Inspector, ask Mademoiselle Kritchnoff to come here. Fetch her.”\\n\\nThe inspector left the room.\\n\\nGuerchard looked at the Duke with a faint air of uneasiness: “I think\\nthat we had better question Mademoiselle Kritchnoff by ourselves,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\nM. Formery looked at him and hesitated. Then he said: “Oh, yes, of\\ncourse, by ourselves.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said the Duke, a trifle haughtily. And he rose and opened\\nthe door. He was just going through it when Guerchard said sharply:\\n\\n“Your Grace—”\\n\\nThe Duke paid no attention to him. He shut the door quickly behind him\\nand sprang swiftly up the stairs. He met the inspector coming down with\\nSonia. Barring their way for a moment he said, in his kindliest voice:\\n“Now you mustn’t be frightened, Mademoiselle Sonia. All you have to do\\nis to try to remember as clearly as you can the circumstances of the\\nearlier thefts at Charmerace. You mustn’t let them confuse you.”\\n\\n“Thank you, your Grace, I will try and be as clear as I can,” said\\nSonia; and she gave him an eloquent glance, full of gratitude for the\\nwarning; and went down the stairs with firm steps.\\n\\nThe Duke went on up the stairs, and knocked softly at the door of M.\\nGournay-Martin’s bedroom. There was no answer to his knock, and he\\nquietly opened the door and looked in. Overcome by his misfortunes, the\\nmillionaire had sunk into a profound sleep and was snoring softly. The\\nDuke stepped inside the room, left the door open a couple of inches,\\ndrew a chair to it, and sat down watching the staircase through the\\nopening of the door.\\n\\nHe sat frowning, with a look of profound pity on his face. Once the\\nsuspense grew too much for him. He rose and walked up and down the\\nroom. His well-bred calm seemed to have deserted him. He muttered\\ncurses on Guerchard, M. Formery, and the whole French criminal system,\\nvery softly, under his breath. His face was distorted to a mask of\\nfury; and once he wiped the little beads of sweat from his forehead\\nwith his handkerchief. Then he recovered himself, sat down in the\\nchair, and resumed his watch on the stairs.\\n\\nAt last, at the end of half an hour, which had seemed to him months\\nlong, he heard voices. The drawing-room door shut, and there were\\nfootsteps on the stairs. The inspector and Sonia came into view.\\n\\nHe waited till they were at the top of the stairs: then he came out of\\nthe room, with his most careless air, and said: “Well, Mademoiselle\\nSonia, I hope you did not find it so very dreadful, after all.”\\n\\nShe was very pale, and there were undried tears on her cheeks. “It was\\nhorrible,” she said faintly. “Horrible. M. Formery was all right—he\\nbelieved me; but that horrible detective would not believe a word I\\nsaid. He confused me. I hardly knew what I was saying.”\\n\\nThe Duke ground his teeth softly. “Never mind, it’s over now. You had\\nbetter lie down and rest. I will tell one of the servants to bring you\\nup a glass of wine.”\\n\\nHe walked with her to the door of her room, and said: “Try to\\nsleep—sleep away the unpleasant memory.”\\n\\nShe went into her room, and the Duke went downstairs and told the\\nbutler to take a glass of champagne up to her. Then he went upstairs to\\nthe drawing-room. M. Formery was at the table writing. Guerchard stood\\nbeside him. He handed what he had written to Guerchard, and, with a\\nsmile of satisfaction, Guerchard folded the paper and put it in his\\npocket.\\n\\n“Well, M. Formery, did Mademoiselle Kritchnoff throw any fresh light on\\nthis mystery?” said the Duke, in a tone of faint contempt.\\n\\n“No—in fact she convinced ME that she knew nothing whatever about it.\\nM. Guerchard seems to entertain a different opinion. But I think that\\neven he is convinced that Mademoiselle Kritchnoff is not a friend of\\nArsène Lupin.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, perhaps she isn’t. But there’s no telling,” said Guerchard\\nslowly.\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin?” cried the Duke. “Surely you never thought that\\nMademoiselle Kritchnoff had anything to do with Arsène Lupin?”\\n\\n“I never thought so,” said M. Formery. “But when one has a fixed idea\\n... well, one has a fixed idea.” He shrugged his shoulders, and looked\\nat Guerchard with contemptuous eyes.\\n\\nThe Duke laughed, an unaffected ringing laugh, but not a pleasant one:\\n“It’s absurd!” he cried.\\n\\n“There are always those thefts,” said Guerchard, with a nettled air.\\n\\n“You have nothing to go upon,” said M. Formery. “What if she did enter\\nthe service of Mademoiselle Gournay-Martin just before the thefts\\nbegan? Besides, after this lapse of time, if she had committed the\\nthefts, you’d find it a job to bring them home to her. It’s not a job\\nworth your doing, anyhow—it’s a job for an ordinary detective,\\nGuerchard.”\\n\\n“There’s always the pendant,” said Guerchard. “I am convinced that that\\npendant is in the house.”\\n\\n“Oh, that stupid pendant! I wish I’d never given it to Mademoiselle\\nGournay-Martin,” said the Duke lightly.\\n\\n“I have a feeling that if I could lay my hand on that pendant—if I\\ncould find who has it, I should have the key to this mystery.”\\n\\n“The devil you would!” said the Duke softly. “That is odd. It is the\\noddest thing about this business I’ve heard yet.”\\n\\n“I have that feeling—I have that feeling,” said Guerchard quietly.\\n\\nThe Duke smiled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\nVICTOIRE’S SLIP\\n\\n\\nThey were silent. The Duke walked to the fireplace, stepped into it,\\nand studied the opening. He came out again and said: “Oh, by the way,\\nM. Formery, the policeman at the front door wanted to stop me going out\\nof the house when I went home to change. I take it that M. Guerchard’s\\nprohibition does not apply to me?”\\n\\n“Of course not—of course not, your Grace,” said M. Formery quickly.\\n\\n“I saw that you had changed your clothes, your Grace,” said Guerchard.\\n“I thought that you had done it here.”\\n\\n“No,” said the Duke, “I went home. The policeman protested; but he went\\nno further, so I did not throw him into the middle of the street.”\\n\\n“Whatever our station, we should respect the law,” said M. Formery\\nsolemnly.\\n\\n“The Republican Law, M. Formery? I am a Royalist,” said the Duke,\\nsmiling at him.\\n\\nM. Formery shook his head sadly.\\n\\n“I was wondering,” said the Duke, “about M. Guerchard’s theory that the\\nburglars were let in the front door of this house by an accomplice.\\nWhy, when they had this beautiful large opening, did they want a front\\ndoor, too?”\\n\\n“I did not know that that was Guerchard’s theory?” said M. Formery, a\\ntrifle contemptuously. “Of course they had no need to use the front\\ndoor.”\\n\\n“Perhaps they had no need to use the front door,” said Guerchard; “but,\\nafter all, the front door was unbolted, and they did not draw the bolts\\nto put us off the scent. Their false scent was already prepared”—he\\nwaved his hand towards the window—“moreover, you must bear in mind that\\nthat opening might not have been made when they entered the house.\\nSuppose that, while they were on the other side of the wall, a brick\\nhad fallen on to the hearth, and alarmed the concierge. We don’t know\\nhow skilful they are; they might not have cared to risk it. I’m\\ninclined to think, on the whole, that they did come in through the\\nfront door.”\\n\\nM. Formery sniffed contemptuously.\\n\\n“Perhaps you’re right,” said the Duke. “But the accomplice?”\\n\\n“I think we shall know more about the accomplice when Victoire awakes,”\\nsaid Guerchard.\\n\\n“The family have such confidence in Victoire,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Perhaps Lupin has, too,” said Guerchard grimly.\\n\\n“Always Lupin!” said M. Formery contemptuously.\\n\\nThere came a knock at the door, and a footman appeared on the\\nthreshold. He informed the Duke that Germaine had returned from her\\nshopping expedition, and was awaiting him in her boudoir. He went to\\nher, and tried to persuade her to put in a word for Sonia, and\\nendeavour to soften Guerchard’s rigour.\\n\\nShe refused to do anything of the kind, declaring that, in view of the\\nvalue of the stolen property, no stone must be left unturned to recover\\nit. The police knew what they were doing; they must have a free hand.\\nThe Duke did not press her with any great vigour; he realized the\\nfutility of an appeal to a nature so shallow, so self-centred, and so\\nlacking in sympathy. He took his revenge by teasing her about the\\nwedding presents which were still flowing in. Her father’s business\\nfriends were still striving to outdo one another in the costliness of\\nthe jewelry they were giving her. The great houses of the Faubourg\\nSaint-Germain were still refraining firmly from anything that savoured\\nof extravagance or ostentation. While he was with her the eleventh\\npaper-knife came—from his mother’s friend, the Duchess of Veauléglise.\\nThe Duke was overwhelmed with joy at the sight of it, and his delighted\\ncomments drove Germaine to the last extremity of exasperation. The\\nresult was that she begged him, with petulant asperity, to get out of\\nher sight.\\n\\nHe complied with her request, almost with alacrity, and returned to M.\\nFormery and Guerchard. He found them at a standstill, waiting for\\nreports from the detectives who were hunting outside the house for\\ninformation about the movements of the burglars with the stolen booty,\\nand apparently finding none. The police were also hunting for the\\nstolen motor-cars, not only in Paris and its environs, but also all\\nalong the road between Paris and Charmerace.\\n\\nAt about five o’clock Guerchard grew tired of the inaction, and went\\nout himself to assist his subordinates, leaving M. Formery in charge of\\nthe house itself. He promised to be back by half-past seven, to let the\\nexamining magistrate, who had an engagement for the evening, get away.\\nThe Duke spent his time between the drawing-room, where M. Formery\\nentertained him with anecdotes of his professional skill, and the\\nboudoir, where Germaine was entertaining envious young friends who came\\nto see her wedding presents. The friends of Germaine were always a\\nlittle ill at ease in the society of the Duke, belonging as they did to\\nthat wealthy middle class which has made France what she is. His\\nindifference to the doings of the old friends of his family saddened\\nthem; and they were unable to understand his airy and persistent\\ntrifling. It seemed to them a discord in the cosmic tune.\\n\\nThe afternoon wore away, and at half-past seven Guerchard had not\\nreturned. M. Formery waited for him, fuming, for ten minutes, then left\\nthe house in charge of the inspector, and went off to his engagement.\\nM. Gournay-Martin was entertaining two financiers and their wives, two\\nof their daughters, and two friends of the Duke, the Baron de Vernan\\nand the Comte de Vauvineuse, at dinner that night. Thanks to the Duke,\\nthe party was of a liveliness to which the gorgeous dining-room had\\nbeen very little used since it had been so fortunate as to become the\\nproperty of M. Gournay-Martin.\\n\\nThe millionaire had been looking forward to an evening of luxurious\\nwoe, deploring the loss of his treasures—giving their prices—to his\\nsympathetic friends. The Duke had other views; and they prevailed.\\nAfter dinner the guests went to the smoking-room, since the\\ndrawing-rooms were in possession of Guerchard. Soon after ten the Duke\\nslipped away from them, and went to the detective. Guerchard’s was not\\na face at any time full of expression, and all that the Duke saw on it\\nwas a subdued dulness.\\n\\n“Well, M. Guerchard,” he said cheerfully, “what luck? Have any of your\\nmen come across any traces of the passage of the burglars with their\\nbooty?”\\n\\n“No, your Grace; so far, all the luck has been with the burglars. For\\nall that any one seems to have seen them, they might have vanished into\\nthe bowels of the earth through the floor of the cellars in the empty\\nhouse next door. That means that they were very quick loading whatever\\nvehicle they used with their plunder. I should think, myself, that they\\nfirst carried everything from this house down into the hall of the\\nhouse next door; and then, of course, they could be very quick getting\\nthem from hall to their van, or whatever it was. But still, some one\\nsaw that van—saw it drive up to the house, or waiting at the house, or\\ndriving away from it.”\\n\\n“Is M. Formery coming back?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Not to-night,” said Guerchard. “The affair is in my hands now; and I\\nhave my own men on it—men of some intelligence, or, at any rate, men\\nwho know my ways, and how I want things done.”\\n\\n“It must be a relief,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, no, I’m used to M. Formery—to all the examining magistrates in\\nParis, and in most of the big provincial towns. They do not really\\nhamper me; and often I get an idea from them; for some of them are men\\nof real intelligence.”\\n\\n“And others are not: I understand,” said the Duke.\\n\\nThe door opened and Bonavent, the detective, came in.\\n\\n“The housekeeper’s awake, M. Guerchard,” he said.\\n\\n“Good, bring her down here,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Perhaps you’d like me to go,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Guerchard. “If it would interest you to hear me question\\nher, please stay.”\\n\\nBonavent left the room. The Duke sat down in an easy chair, and\\nGuerchard stood before the fireplace.\\n\\n“M. Formery told me, when you were out this afternoon, that he believed\\nthis housekeeper to be quite innocent,” said the Duke idly.\\n\\n“There is certainly one innocent in this affair,” said Guerchard,\\ngrinning.\\n\\n“Who is that?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“The examining magistrate,” said Guerchard.\\n\\nThe door opened, and Bonavent brought Victoire in. She was a big,\\nmiddle-aged woman, with a pleasant, cheerful, ruddy face, black-haired,\\nwith sparkling brown eyes, which did not seem to have been at all\\ndimmed by her long, drugged sleep. She looked like a well-to-do\\nfarmer’s wife, a buxom, good-natured, managing woman.\\n\\nAs soon as she came into the room, she said quickly:\\n\\n“I wish, Mr. Inspector, your man would have given me time to put on a\\ndecent dress. I must have been sleeping in this one ever since those\\nrascals tied me up and put that smelly handkerchief over my face. I\\nnever saw such a nasty-looking crew as they were in my life.”\\n\\n“How many were there, Madame Victoire?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Dozens! The house was just swarming with them. I heard the noise; I\\ncame downstairs; and on the landing outside the door here, one of them\\njumped on me from behind and nearly choked me—to prevent me from\\nscreaming, I suppose.”\\n\\n“And they were a nasty-looking crew, were they?” said Guerchard. “Did\\nyou see their faces?”\\n\\n“No, I wish I had! I should know them again if I had; but they were all\\nmasked,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“Sit down, Madame Victoire. There’s no need to tire you,” said\\nGuerchard. And she sat down on a chair facing him.\\n\\n“Let’s see, you sleep in one of the top rooms, Madame Victoire. It has\\na dormer window, set in the roof, hasn’t it?” said Guerchard, in the\\nsame polite, pleasant voice.\\n\\n“Yes; yes. But what has that got to do with it?” said Victoire.\\n\\n“Please answer my questions,” said Guerchard sharply. “You went to\\nsleep in your room. Did you hear any noise on the roof?”\\n\\n“On the roof? How should I hear it on the roof? There wouldn’t be any\\nnoise on the roof,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“You heard nothing on the roof?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“No; the noise I heard was down here,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“Yes, and you came down to see what was making it. And you were seized\\nfrom behind on the landing, and brought in here,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s right,” said Madame Victoire.\\n\\n“And were you tied up and gagged on the landing, or in here?” said\\nGuerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, I was caught on the landing, and pushed in here, and then tied\\nup,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“I’m sure that wasn’t one man’s job,” said Guerchard, looking at her\\nvigorous figure with admiring eyes.\\n\\n“You may be sure of that,” said Victoire. “It took four of them; and at\\nleast two of them have some nice bruises on their shins to show for\\nit.”\\n\\n“I’m sure they have. And it serves them jolly well right,” said\\nGuerchard, in a tone of warm approval. “And, I suppose, while those\\nfour were tying you up the others stood round and looked on.”\\n\\n“Oh, no, they were far too busy for that,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“What were they doing?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“They were taking the pictures off the walls and carrying them out of\\nthe window down the ladder,” said Victoire.\\n\\nGuerchard’s eyes flickered towards the Duke, but the expression of\\nearnest inquiry on his face never changed.\\n\\n“Now, tell me, did the man who took a picture from the walls carry it\\ndown the ladder himself, or did he hand it through the window to a man\\nwho was standing on the top of a ladder ready to receive it?” he said.\\n\\nVictoire paused as if to recall their action; then she said, “Oh, he\\ngot through the window, and carried it down the ladder himself.”\\n\\n“You’re sure of that?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I am quite sure of it—why should I deceive you, Mr.\\nInspector?” said Victoire quickly; and the Duke saw the first shadow of\\nuneasiness on her face.\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Guerchard. “And where were you?”\\n\\n“Oh, they put me behind the screen.”\\n\\n“No, no, where were you when you came into the room?”\\n\\n“I was against the door,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“And where was the screen?” said Guerchard. “Was it before the\\nfireplace?”\\n\\n“No; it was on one side—the left-hand side,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“Oh, will you show me exactly where it stood?” said Guerchard.\\n\\nVictoire rose, and, Guerchard aiding her, set the screen on the\\nleft-hand side of the fireplace.\\n\\nGuerchard stepped back and looked at it.\\n\\n“Now, this is very important,” he said. “I must have the exact position\\nof the four feet of that screen. Let’s see ... some chalk ... of\\ncourse.... You do some dressmaking, don’t you, Madame Victoire?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I sometimes make a dress for one of the maids in my spare\\ntime,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“Then you’ve got a piece of chalk on you,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” said Victoire, putting her hand to the pocket of her dress.\\n\\nShe paused, took a step backwards, and looked wildly round the room,\\nwhile the colour slowly faded in her ruddy cheeks.\\n\\n“What am I talking about?” she said in an uncertain, shaky voice. “I\\nhaven’t any chalk—I—ran out of chalk the day before yesterday.”\\n\\n“I think you have, Madame Victoire. Feel in your pocket and see,” said\\nGuerchard sternly. His voice had lost its suavity; his face its smile:\\nhis eyes had grown dangerous.\\n\\n“No, no; I have no chalk,” cried Victoire.\\n\\nWith a sudden leap Guerchard sprang upon her, caught her in a firm grip\\nwith his right arm, and his left hand plunged into her pocket.\\n\\n“Let me go! Let me go! You’re hurting,” she cried.\\n\\nGuerchard loosed her and stepped back.\\n\\n“What’s this?” he said; and he held up between his thumb and forefinger\\na piece of blue chalk.\\n\\nVictoire drew herself up and faced him gallantly: “Well, what of it?—it\\nis chalk. Mayn’t an honest woman carry chalk in her pockets without\\nbeing insulted and pulled about by every policeman she comes across?”\\nshe cried.\\n\\n“That will be for the examining magistrate to decide,” said Guerchard;\\nand he went to the door and called Bonavent. Bonavent came in, and\\nGuerchard said: “When the prison van comes, put this woman in it; and\\nsend her down to the station.”\\n\\n“But what have I done?” cried Victoire. “I’m innocent! I declare I’m\\ninnocent. I’ve done nothing at all. It’s not a crime to carry a piece\\nof chalk in one’s pocket.”\\n\\n“Now, that’s a matter for the examining magistrate. You can explain it\\nto him,” said Guerchard. “I’ve got nothing to do with it: so it’s no\\ngood making a fuss now. Do go quietly, there’s a good woman.”\\n\\nHe spoke in a quiet, business-like tone. Victoire looked him in the\\neyes, then drew herself up, and went quietly out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\nSONIA’S ESCAPE\\n\\n\\n“One of M. Formery’s innocents,” said Guerchard, turning to the Duke.\\n\\n“The chalk?” said the Duke. “Is it the same chalk?”\\n\\n“It’s blue,” said Guerchard, holding it out. “The same as that of the\\nsignatures on the walls. Add that fact to the woman’s sudden\\nrealization of what she was doing, and you’ll see that they were\\nwritten with it.”\\n\\n“It is rather a surprise,” said the Duke. “To look at her you would\\nthink that she was the most honest woman in the world.”\\n\\n“Ah, you don’t know Lupin, your Grace,” said Guerchard. “He can do\\nanything with women; and they’ll do anything for him. And, what’s more,\\nas far as I can see, it doesn’t make a scrap of difference whether\\nthey’re honest or not. The fair-haired lady I was telling you about was\\nprobably an honest woman; Ganimard is sure of it. We should have found\\nout long ago who she was if she had been a wrong ’un. And Ganimard also\\nswears that when he arrested Lupin on board the _Provence_ some woman,\\nsome ordinary, honest woman among the passengers, carried away Lady\\nGarland’s jewels, which he had stolen and was bringing to America, and\\nalong with them a matter of eight hundred pounds which he had stolen\\nfrom a fellow-passenger on the voyage.”\\n\\n“That power of fascination which some men exercise on women is one of\\nthose mysteries which science should investigate before it does\\nanything else,” said the Duke, in a reflective tone. “Now I come to\\nthink of it, I had much better have spent my time on that investigation\\nthan on that tedious journey to the South Pole. All the same, I’m\\ndeucedly sorry for that woman, Victoire. She looks such a good soul.”\\n\\nGuerchard shrugged his shoulders: “The prisons are full of good souls,”\\nhe said, with cynical wisdom born of experience. “They get caught so\\nmuch more often than the bad.”\\n\\n“It seems rather mean of Lupin to make use of women like this, and get\\nthem into trouble,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“But he doesn’t,” said Guerchard quickly. “At least he hasn’t up to\\nnow. This Victoire is the first we’ve caught. I look on it as a good\\nomen.”\\n\\nHe walked across the room, picked up his cloak, and took a card-case\\nfrom the inner pocket of it. “If you don’t mind, your Grace, I want you\\nto show this permit to my men who are keeping the door, whenever you go\\nout of the house. It’s just a formality; but I attach considerable\\nimportance to it, for I really ought not to make exceptions in favour\\nof any one. I have two men at the door, and they have orders to let\\nnobody out without my written permission. Of course M. Gournay-Martin’s\\nguests are different. Bonavent has orders to pass them out. And, if\\nyour Grace doesn’t mind, it will help me. If you carry a permit, no one\\nelse will dream of complaining of having to do so.”\\n\\n“Oh, I don’t mind, if it’s of any help to you,” said the Duke\\ncheerfully.\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Guerchard. And he wrote on his card and handed it to\\nthe Duke.\\n\\nThe Duke took it and looked at it. On it was written:\\n\\n“Pass the Duke of Charmerace.”\\n“J. GUERCHARD.”\\n\\n\\n“It’s quite military,” said the Duke, putting the card into his\\nwaistcoat pocket.\\n\\nThere came a knock at the door, and a tall, thin, bearded man came into\\nthe room.\\n\\n“Ah, Dieusy! At last! What news?” cried Guerchard.\\n\\nDieusy saluted: “I’ve learnt that a motor-van was waiting outside the\\nnext house—in the side street,” he said.\\n\\n“At what time?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Between four and five in the morning,” said Dieusy.\\n\\n“Who saw it?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“A scavenger. He thinks that it was nearly five o’clock when the van\\ndrove off.”\\n\\n“Between four and five—nearly five. Then they filled up the opening\\nbefore they loaded the van. I thought they would,” said Guerchard,\\nthoughtfully. “Anything else?”\\n\\n“A few minutes after the van had gone a man in motoring dress came out\\nof the house,” said Dieusy.\\n\\n“In motoring dress?” said Guerchard quickly.\\n\\n“Yes. And a little way from the house he threw away his cigarette. The\\nscavenger thought the whole business a little queer, and he picked up\\nthe cigarette and kept it. Here it is.”\\n\\nHe handed it to Guerchard, whose eyes scanned it carelessly and then\\nglued themselves to it.\\n\\n“A gold-tipped cigarette ... marked Mercedes ... Why, your Grace, this\\nis one of your cigarettes!”\\n\\n“But this is incredible!” cried the Duke.\\n\\n“Not at all,” said Guerchard. “It’s merely another link in the chain.\\nI’ve no doubt you have some of these cigarettes at Charmerace.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I’ve had a box on most of the tables,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Well, there you are,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, I see what you’re driving at,” said the Duke. “You mean that one\\nof the Charolais must have taken a box.”\\n\\n“Well, we know that they’d hardly stick at a box of cigarettes,” said\\nGuerchard.\\n\\n“Yes ... but I thought ...” said the Duke; and he paused.\\n\\n“You thought what?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Then Lupin ... since it was Lupin who managed the business last\\nnight—since you found those salvias in the house next door ... then\\nLupin came from Charmerace.”\\n\\n“Evidently,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“And Lupin is one of the Charolais.”\\n\\n“Oh, that’s another matter,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“But it’s certain, absolutely certain,” said the Duke. “We have the\\nconnecting links ... the salvias ... this cigarette.”\\n\\n“It looks very like it. You’re pretty quick on a scent, I must say,”\\nsaid Guerchard. “What a detective you would have made! Only ... nothing\\nis certain.”\\n\\n“But it IS. Whatever more do you want? Was he at Charmerace yesterday,\\nor was he not? Did he, or did he not, arrange the theft of the\\nmotor-cars?”\\n\\n“Certainly he did. But he himself might have remained in the background\\nall the while,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“In what shape? ... Under what mask? ... By Jove, I should like to see\\nthis fellow!” said the Duke.\\n\\n“We shall see him to-night,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“To-night?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Of course we shall; for he will come to steal the coronet between a\\nquarter to twelve and midnight,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Never!” said the Duke. “You don’t really believe that he’ll have the\\ncheek to attempt such a mad act?”\\n\\n“Ah, you don’t know this man, your Grace ... his extraordinary mixture\\nof coolness and audacity. It’s the danger that attracts him. He throws\\nhimself into the fire, and he doesn’t get burnt. For the last ten years\\nI’ve been saying to myself, ‘Here we are: this time I’ve got him! ...\\nAt last I’m going to nab him.’ But I’ve said that day after day,” said\\nGuerchard; and he paused.\\n\\n“Well?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Well, the days pass; and I never nab him. Oh, he is thick, I tell\\nyou.... He’s a joker, he is ... a regular artist”—he ground his\\nteeth—“The damned thief!”\\n\\nThe Duke looked at him, and said slowly, “Then you think that to-night\\nLupin—”\\n\\n“You’ve followed the scent with me, your Grace,” Guerchard interrupted\\nquickly and vehemently. “We’ve picked up each clue together. You’ve\\nalmost seen this man at work.... You’ve understood him. Isn’t a man\\nlike this, I ask you, capable of anything?”\\n\\n“He is,” said the Duke, with conviction.\\n\\n“Well, then,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Perhaps you’re right,” said the Duke.\\n\\nGuerchard turned to Dieusy and said, in a quieter voice, “And when the\\nscavenger had picked up the cigarette, did he follow the motorist?”\\n\\n“Yes, he followed him for about a hundred yards. He went down into\\nSureau Street, and turned westwards. Then a motor-car came along; he\\ngot into it, and went off.”\\n\\n“What kind of a motor-car?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“A big car, and dark red in colour,” said Dieusy.\\n\\n“The Limousine!” cried the Duke.\\n\\n“That’s all I’ve got so far, sir,” said Dieusy.\\n\\n“Well, off you go,” said Guerchard. “Now that you’ve got started,\\nyou’ll probably get something else before very long.”\\n\\nDieusy saluted and went.\\n\\n“Things are beginning to move,” said Guerchard cheerfully. “First\\nVictoire, and now this motor-van.”\\n\\n“They are indeed,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“After all, it ought not to be very difficult to trace that motor-van,”\\nsaid Guerchard, in a musing tone. “At any rate, its movements ought to\\nbe easy enough to follow up till about six. Then, of course, there\\nwould be a good many others about, delivering goods.”\\n\\n“You seem to have all the possible information you can want at your\\nfinger-ends,” said the Duke, in an admiring tone.\\n\\n“I suppose I know the life of Paris as well as anybody,” said\\nGuerchard.\\n\\nThey were silent for a while. Then Germaine’s maid, Irma, came into the\\nroom and said:\\n\\n“If you please, your Grace, Mademoiselle Kritchnoff would like to speak\\nto you for a moment.”\\n\\n“Oh? Where is she?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“She’s in her room, your Grace.”\\n\\n“Oh, very well, I’ll go up to her,” said the Duke. “I can speak to her\\nin the library.”\\n\\nHe rose and was going towards the door when Guerchard stepped forward,\\nbarring his way, and said, “No, your Grace.”\\n\\n“No? Why?” said the Duke haughtily.\\n\\n“I beg you will wait a minute or two till I’ve had a word with you,”\\nsaid Guerchard; and he drew a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and\\nheld it up.\\n\\nThe Duke looked at Guerchard’s face, and he looked at the paper in his\\nhand; then he said: “Oh, very well.” And, turning to Irma, he added\\nquietly, “Tell Mademoiselle Kritchnoff that I’m in the drawing-room.”\\n\\n“Yes, your Grace, in the drawing-room,” said Irma; and she turned to\\ngo.\\n\\n“Yes; and say that I shall be engaged for the next five minutes—the\\nnext five minutes, do you understand?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes, your Grace,” said Irma; and she went out of the door.\\n\\n“Ask Mademoiselle Kritchnoff to put on her hat and cloak,” said\\nGuerchard.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Irma; and she went.\\n\\nThe Duke turned sharply on Guerchard, and said: “Now, why on earth? ...\\nI don’t understand.”\\n\\n“I got this from M. Formery,” said Guerchard, holding up the paper.\\n\\n“Well,” said the Duke. “What is it?”\\n\\n“It’s a warrant, your Grace,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“What! ... A warrant! ... Not for the arrest of Mademoiselle\\nKritchnoff?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, come, it’s impossible,” said the Duke. “You’re never going to\\narrest that child?”\\n\\n“I am, indeed,” said Guerchard. “Her examination this afternoon was in\\nthe highest degree unsatisfactory. Her answers were embarrassed,\\ncontradictory, and in every way suspicious.”\\n\\n“And you’ve made up your mind to arrest her?” said the Duke slowly,\\nknitting his brow in anxious thought.\\n\\n“I have, indeed,” said Guerchard. “And I’m going to do it now. The\\nprison van ought to be waiting at the door.” He looked at his watch.\\n“She and Victoire can go together.”\\n\\n“So ... you’re going to arrest her ... you’re going to arrest her?”\\nsaid the Duke thoughtfully: and he took a step or two up and down the\\nroom, still thinking hard.\\n\\n“Well, you understand the position, don’t you, your Grace?” said\\nGuerchard, in a tone of apology. “Believe me that, personally, I’ve no\\nanimosity against Mademoiselle Kritchnoff. In fact, the child attracts\\nme.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Duke softly, in a musing tone. “She has the air of a\\nchild who has lost its way ... lost its way in life.... And that poor\\nlittle hiding-place she found ... that rolled-up handkerchief ...\\nthrown down in the corner of the little room in the house next door ...\\nit was absolutely absurd.”\\n\\n“What! A handkerchief!” cried Guerchard, with an air of sudden, utter\\nsurprise.\\n\\n“The child’s clumsiness is positively pitiful,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“What was in the handkerchief? ... The pearls of the pendant?” cried\\nGuerchard.\\n\\n“Yes: I supposed you knew all about it. Of course M. Formery left word\\nfor you,” said the Duke, with an air of surprise at the ignorance of\\nthe detective.\\n\\n“No: I’ve heard nothing about it,” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“He didn’t leave word for you?” said the Duke, in a tone of greater\\nsurprise. “Oh, well, I dare say that he thought to-morrow would do. Of\\ncourse you were out of the house when he found it. She must have\\nslipped out of her room soon after you went.”\\n\\n“He found a handkerchief belonging to Mademoiselle Kritchnoff. Where is\\nit?” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“M. Formery took the pearls, but he left the handkerchief. I suppose\\nit’s in the corner where he found it,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“He left the handkerchief?” cried Guerchard. “If that isn’t just like\\nthe fool! He ought to keep hens; it’s all he’s fit for!”\\n\\nHe ran to the fireplace, seized the lantern, and began lighting it:\\n“Where is the handkerchief?” he cried.\\n\\n“In the left-hand corner of the little room on the right on the second\\nfloor. But if you’re going to arrest Mademoiselle Kritchnoff, why are\\nyou bothering about the handkerchief? It can’t be of any importance,”\\nsaid the Duke.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” said Guerchard. “But it is.”\\n\\n“But why?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“I was arresting Mademoiselle Kritchnoff all right because I had a very\\nstrong presumption of her guilt. But I hadn’t the slightest proof of\\nit,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“What?” cried the Duke, in a horrified tone.\\n\\n“No, you’ve just given me the proof; and since she was able to hide the\\npearls in the house next door, she knew the road which led to it.\\nTherefore she’s an accomplice,” said Guerchard, in a triumphant tone.\\n\\n“What? Do you think that, too?” cried the Duke. “Good Heavens! And it’s\\nme! ... It’s my senselessness! ... It’s my fault that you’ve got your\\nproof!” He spoke in a tone of acute distress.\\n\\n“It was your duty to give it me,” said Guerchard sternly; and he began\\nto mount the steps.\\n\\n“Shall I come with you? I know where the handkerchief is,” said the\\nDuke quickly.\\n\\n“No, thank you, your Grace,” said Guerchard. “I prefer to go alone.”\\n\\n“You’d better let me help you,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No, your Grace,” said Guerchard firmly.\\n\\n“I must really insist,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No—no—no,” said Guerchard vehemently, with stern decision. “It’s no\\nuse your insisting, your Grace; I prefer to go alone. I shall only be\\ngone a minute or two.”\\n\\n“Just as you like,” said the Duke stiffly.\\n\\nThe legs of Guerchard disappeared up the steps. The Duke stood\\nlistening with all his ears. Directly he heard the sound of Guerchard’s\\nheels on the floor, when he dropped from the chimney-piece of the next\\nroom, he went swiftly to the door, opened it, and went out. Bonavent\\nwas sitting on the chair on which the young policeman had sat during\\nthe afternoon. Sonia, in her hat and cloak, was half-way down the\\nstairs.\\n\\nThe Duke put his head inside the drawing-room door, and said to the\\nempty room: “Here is Mademoiselle Kritchnoff, M. Guerchard.” He held\\nopen the door, Sonia came down the stairs, and went through it. The\\nDuke followed her into the drawing-room, and shut the door.\\n\\n“There’s not a moment to lose,” he said in a low voice.\\n\\n“Oh, what is it, your Grace?” said Sonia anxiously.\\n\\n“Guerchard has a warrant for your arrest.”\\n\\n“Then I’m lost!” cried Sonia, in a panic-stricken voice.\\n\\n“No, you’re not. You must go—at once,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“But how can I go? No one can get out of the house. M. Guerchard won’t\\nlet them,” cried Sonia, panic-stricken.\\n\\n“We can get over that,” said the Duke.\\n\\nHe ran to Guerchard’s cloak, took the card-case from the inner pocket,\\nwent to the writing-table, and sat down. He took from his waist-coat\\npocket the permit which Guerchard had given him, and a pencil. Then he\\ntook a card from the card-case, set the permit on the table before him,\\nand began to imitate Guerchard’s handwriting with an amazing exactness.\\nHe wrote on the card:\\n\\n“Pass Mademoiselle Kritchnoff.”\\n“J. GUERCHARD.”\\n\\n\\nSonia stood by his side, panting quickly with fear, and watched him do\\nit. He had scarcely finished the last stroke, when they heard a noise\\non the other side of the opening into the empty house. The Duke looked\\nat the fireplace, and his teeth bared in an expression of cold\\nferocity. He rose with clenched fists, and took a step towards the\\nfireplace.\\n\\n“Your Grace? Your Grace?” called the voice of Guerchard.\\n\\n“What is it?” answered the Duke quietly.\\n\\n“I can’t see any handkerchief,” said Guerchard. “Didn’t you say it was\\nin the left-hand corner of the little room on the right?”\\n\\n“I told you you’d better let me come with you, and find it,” said the\\nDuke, in a tone of triumph. “It’s in the right-hand corner of the\\nlittle room on the left.”\\n\\n“I could have sworn you said the little room on the right,” said\\nGuerchard.\\n\\nThey heard his footfalls die away.\\n\\n“Now, you must get out of the house quickly.” said the Duke. “Show this\\ncard to the detectives at the door, and they’ll pass you without a\\nword.”\\n\\nHe pressed the card into her hand.\\n\\n“But—but—this card?” stammered Sonia.\\n\\n“There’s no time to lose,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“But this is madness,” said Sonia. “When Guerchard finds out about this\\ncard—that you—you—”\\n\\n“There’s no need to bother about that,” interrupted the Duke quickly.\\n“Where are you going to?”\\n\\n“A little hotel near the Star. I’ve forgotten the name of it,” said\\nSonia. “But this card—”\\n\\n“Has it a telephone?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes—No. 555, Central,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“If I haven’t telephoned to you before half-past eight to-morrow\\nmorning, come straight to my house,” said the Duke, scribbling the\\ntelephone number on his shirt-cuff.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said Sonia. “But this card.... When Guerchard knows ...\\nwhen he discovers.... Oh, I can’t let you get into trouble for me.”\\n\\n“I shan’t. But go—go,” said the Duke, and he slipped his right arm\\nround her and drew her to the door.\\n\\n“Oh, how good you are to me,” said Sonia softly.\\n\\nThe Duke’s other arm went round her; he drew her to him, and their lips\\nmet.\\n\\nHe loosed her, and opened the door, saying loudly: “You’re sure you\\nwon’t have a cab, Mademoiselle Kritchnoff?”\\n\\n“No; no, thank you, your Grace. Goodnight,” said Sonia. And she went\\nthrough the door with a transfigured face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\nTHE DUKE STAYS\\n\\n\\nThe Duke shut the door and leant against it, listening anxiously,\\nbreathing quickly. There came the bang of the front door. With a deep\\nsigh of relief he left the door, came briskly, smiling, across the\\nroom, and put the card-case back into the pocket of Guerchard’s cloak.\\nHe lighted a cigarette, dropped into an easy chair, and sat waiting\\nwith an entirely careless air for the detective’s return. Presently he\\nheard quick footsteps on the bare boards of the empty room beyond the\\nopening. Then Guerchard came down the steps and out of the fireplace.\\n\\nHis face wore an expression of extreme perplexity:\\n\\n“I can’t understand it,” he said. “I found nothing.”\\n\\n“Nothing?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No. Are you sure you saw the handkerchief in one of those little rooms\\non the second floor—quite sure?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Of course I did,” said the Duke. “Isn’t it there?”\\n\\n“No,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“You can’t have looked properly,” said the Duke, with a touch of irony\\nin his voice. “If I were you, I should go back and look again.”\\n\\n“No. If I’ve looked for a thing, I’ve looked for it. There’s no need\\nfor me to look a second time. But, all the same, it’s rather funny.\\nDoesn’t it strike you as being rather funny, your Grace?” said\\nGuerchard, with a worried air.\\n\\n“It strikes me as being uncommonly funny,” said the Duke, with an\\nambiguous smile.\\n\\nGuerchard looked at him with a sudden uneasiness; then he rang the\\nbell.\\n\\nBonavent came into the room.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Kritchnoff, Bonavent. It’s quite time,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Kritchnoff?” said Bonavent, with an air of surprise.\\n\\n“Yes, it’s time that she was taken to the police-station.”\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Kritchnoff has gone, sir,” said Bonavent, in a tone of\\nquiet remonstrance.\\n\\n“Gone? What do you mean by gone?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Gone, sir, gone!” said Bonavent patiently.\\n\\n“But you’re mad.... Mad!” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“No, I’m not mad,” said Bonavent. “Gone! But who let her go?” cried\\nGuerchard.\\n\\n“The men at the door,” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“The men at the door,” said Guerchard, in a tone of stupefaction. “But\\nshe had to have my permit ... my permit on my card! Send the fools up\\nto me!”\\n\\nBonavent went to the top of the staircase, and called down it.\\nGuerchard followed him. Two detectives came hurrying up the stairs and\\ninto the drawing-room.\\n\\n“What the devil do you mean by letting Mademoiselle Kritchnoff leave\\nthe house without my permit, written on my card?” cried Guerchard\\nviolently.\\n\\n“But she had your permit, sir, and it WAS written on your card,”\\nstammered one of the detectives.\\n\\n“It was? ... it was?” said Guerchard. “Then, by Jove, it was a\\nforgery!”\\n\\nHe stood thoughtful for a moment. Then quietly he told his two men to\\ngo back to their post. He did not stir for a minute or two, puzzling it\\nout, seeking light.\\n\\nThen he came back slowly into the drawing-room and looked uneasily at\\nthe Duke. The Duke was sitting in his easy chair, smoking a cigarette\\nwith a listless air. Guerchard looked at him, and looked at him, almost\\nas if he now saw him for the first time.\\n\\n“Well?” said the Duke, “have you sent that poor child off to prison? If\\nI’d done a thing like that I don’t think I should sleep very well, M.\\nGuerchard.”\\n\\n“That poor child has just escaped, by means of a forged permit,” said\\nGuerchard very glumly.\\n\\n“By Jove, I AM glad to hear that!” cried the Duke. “You’ll forgive my\\nlack of sympathy, M. Guerchard; but she was such a child.”\\n\\n“Not too young to be Lupin’s accomplice,” said Guerchard drily.\\n\\n“You really think she is?” said the Duke, in a tone of doubt.\\n\\n“I’m sure of it,” said Guerchard, with decision; then he added slowly,\\nwith a perplexed air:\\n\\n“But how—how—could she get that forged permit?”\\n\\nThe Duke shook his head, and looked as solemn as an owl. Guerchard\\nlooked at him uneasily, went out of the drawing-room, and shut the\\ndoor.\\n\\n“How long has Mademoiselle Kritchnoff been gone?” he said to Bonavent.\\n\\n“Not much more than five minutes,” said Bonavent. “She came out from\\ntalking to you in the drawing-room—”\\n\\n“Talking to me in the drawing-room!” exclaimed Guerchard.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Bonavent. “She came out and went straight down the stairs\\nand out of the house.”\\n\\nA faint, sighing gasp came from Guerchard’s lips. He dashed into the\\ndrawing-room, crossed the room quickly to his cloak, picked it up, took\\nthe card-case out of the pocket, and counted the cards in it. Then he\\nlooked at the Duke.\\n\\nThe Duke smiled at him, a charming smile, almost caressing.\\n\\nThere seemed to be a lump in Guerchard’s throat; he swallowed it\\nloudly.\\n\\nHe put the card-case into the breast-pocket of the coat he was wearing.\\nThen he cried sharply, “Bonavent! Bonavent!”\\n\\nBonavent opened the door, and stood in the doorway.\\n\\n“You sent off Victoire in the prison-van, I suppose,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, a long while ago, sir,” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“The van had been waiting at the door since half-past nine.”\\n\\n“Since half-past nine? ... But I told them I shouldn’t want it till a\\nquarter to eleven. I suppose they were making an effort to be in time\\nfor once. Well, it doesn’t matter,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Then I suppose I’d better send the other prison-van away?” said\\nBonavent.\\n\\n“What other van?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“The van which has just arrived,” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“What! What on earth are you talking about?” cried Guerchard, with a\\nsudden anxiety in his voice and on his face.\\n\\n“Didn’t you order two prison-vans?” said Bonavent.\\n\\nGuerchard jumped; and his face went purple with fury and dismay. “You\\ndon’t mean to tell me that two prison-vans have been here?” he cried.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“Damnation!” cried Guerchard. “In which of them did you put Victoire?\\nIn which of them?”\\n\\n“Why, in the first, sir,” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“Did you see the police in charge of it? The coachman?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“Did you recognize them?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“No,” said Bonavent; “they must have been new men. They told me they\\ncame from the Santé.”\\n\\n“You silly fool!” said Guerchard through his teeth. “A fine lot of\\nsense you’ve got.”\\n\\n“Why, what’s the matter?” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“We’re done, done in the eye!” roared Guerchard. “It’s a stroke—a\\nstroke—”\\n\\n“Of Lupin’s!” interposed the Duke softly.\\n\\n“But I don’t understand,” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“You don’t understand, you idiot!” cried Guerchard. “You’ve sent\\nVictoire away in a sham prison-van—a prison-van belonging to Lupin. Oh,\\nthat scoundrel! He always has something up his sleeve.”\\n\\n“He certainly shows foresight,” said the Duke. “It was very clever of\\nhim to foresee the arrest of Victoire and provide against it.”\\n\\n“Yes, but where is the leakage? Where is the leakage?” cried Guerchard,\\nfuming. “How did he learn that the doctor said that she would recover\\nher wits at ten o’clock? Here I’ve had a guard at the door all day;\\nI’ve imprisoned the household; all the provisions have been received\\ndirectly by a man of mine; and here he is, ready to pick up Victoire\\nthe very moment she gives herself away! Where is the leakage?”\\n\\nHe turned on Bonavent, and went on: “It’s no use your standing there\\nwith your mouth open, looking like a fool. Go upstairs to the servants’\\nquarters and search Victoire’s room again. That fool of an inspector\\nmay have missed something, just as he missed Victoire herself. Get on!\\nBe smart!”\\n\\nBonavent went off briskly. Guerchard paced up and down the room,\\nscowling.\\n\\n“Really, I’m beginning to agree with you, M. Guerchard, that this Lupin\\nis a remarkable man,” said the Duke. “That prison-van is\\nextraordinarily neat.”\\n\\n“I’ll prison-van him!” cried Guerchard. “But what fools I have to work\\nwith. If I could get hold of people of ordinary intelligence it would\\nbe impossible to play such a trick as that.”\\n\\n“I don’t know about that,” said the Duke thoughtfully. “I think it\\nwould have required an uncommon fool to discover that trick.”\\n\\n“What on earth do you mean? Why?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Because it’s so wonderfully simple,” said the Duke. “And at the same\\ntime it’s such infernal cheek.”\\n\\n“There’s something in that,” said Guerchard grumpily. “But then, I’m\\nalways saying to my men, ‘Suspect everything; suspect everybody;\\nsuspect, suspect, suspect.’ I tell you, your Grace, that there is only\\none motto for the successful detective, and that is that one word,\\n‘suspect.’”\\n\\n“It can’t be a very comfortable business, then,” said the Duke. “But I\\nsuppose it has its charms.”\\n\\n“Oh, one gets used to the disagreeable part,” said Guerchard.\\n\\nThe telephone bell rang; and he rose and went to it. He put the\\nreceiver to his ear and said, “Yes; it’s I—Chief-Inspector Guerchard.”\\n\\nHe turned and said to the Duke, “It’s the gardener at Charmerace, your\\nGrace.”\\n\\n“Is it?” said the Duke indifferently.\\n\\nGuerchard turned to the telephone. “Are you there?” he said. “Can you\\nhear me clearly? ... I want to know who was in your hot-house yesterday\\n... who could have gathered some of your pink salvias?”\\n\\n“I told you that it was I,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I know,” said Guerchard. And he turned again to the\\ntelephone. “Yes, yesterday,” he said. “Nobody else? ... No one but the\\nDuke of Charmerace? ... Are you sure?... quite sure?... absolutely\\nsure? ... Yes, that’s all I wanted to know ... thank you.”\\n\\nHe turned to the Duke and said, “Did you hear that, your Grace? The\\ngardener says that you were the only person in his hot-houses\\nyesterday, the only person who could have plucked any pink salvias.”\\n\\n“Does he?” said the Duke carelessly.\\n\\nGuerchard looked at him, his brow knitted in a faint, pondering frown.\\nThen the door opened, and Bonavent came in: “I’ve been through\\nVictoire’s room,” he said, “and all I could find that might be of any\\nuse is this—a prayer-book. It was on her dressing-table just as she\\nleft it. The inspector hadn’t touched it.”\\n\\n“What about it?” said Guerchard, taking the prayer-book.\\n\\n“There’s a photograph in it,” said Bonavent. “It may come in useful\\nwhen we circulate her description; for I suppose we shall try to get\\nhold of Victoire.”\\n\\nGuerchard took the photograph from the prayer-book and looked at it:\\n“It looks about ten years old,” he said. “It’s a good deal faded for\\nreproduction. Hullo! What have we here?”\\n\\nThe photograph showed Victoire in her Sunday best, and with her a boy\\nof seventeen or eighteen. Guerchard’s eyes glued themselves to the face\\nof the boy. He stared at it, holding the portrait now nearer, now\\nfurther off. His eyes kept stealing covertly from the photograph to the\\nface of the Duke.\\n\\nThe Duke caught one of those covert glances, and a vague uneasiness\\nflickered in his eyes. Guerchard saw it. He came nearer to the Duke and\\nlooked at him earnestly, as if he couldn’t believe his eyes.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said the Duke. “What are you looking at so\\ncuriously? Isn’t my tie straight?” And he put up his hand and felt it.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing, nothing,” said Guerchard. And he studied the photograph\\nagain with a frowning face.\\n\\nThere was a noise of voices and laughter in the hall.\\n\\n“Those people are going,” said the Duke. “I must go down and say\\ngood-bye to them.” And he rose and went out of the room.\\n\\nGuerchard stood staring, staring at the photograph.\\n\\nThe Duke ran down the stairs, and said goodbye to the millionaire’s\\nguests. After they had gone, M. Gournay-Martin went quickly up the\\nstairs; Germaine and the Duke followed more slowly.\\n\\n“My father is going to the Ritz to sleep,” said Germaine, “and I’m\\ngoing with him. He doesn’t like the idea of my sleeping in this house\\nto-night. I suppose he’s afraid that Lupin will make an attack in force\\nwith all his gang. Still, if he did, I think that Guerchard could give\\na good account of himself—he’s got men enough in the house, at any\\nrate. Irma tells me it’s swarming with them. It would never do for me\\nto be in the house if there were a fight.”\\n\\n“Oh, come, you don’t really believe that Lupin is coming to-night?”\\nsaid the Duke, with a sceptical laugh. “The whole thing is sheer\\nbluff—he has no more intention of coming tonight to steal that coronet\\nthan—than I have.”\\n\\n“Oh, well, there’s no harm in being on the safe side,” said Germaine.\\n“Everybody’s agreed that he’s a very terrible person. I’ll just run up\\nto my room and get a wrap; Irma has my things all packed. She can come\\nround tomorrow morning to the Ritz and dress me.”\\n\\nShe ran up the stairs, and the Duke went into the drawing-room. He\\nfound Guerchard standing where he had left him, still frowning, still\\nthinking hard.\\n\\n“The family are off to the Ritz. It’s rather a reflection on your\\npowers of protecting them, isn’t it?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Oh, well, I expect they’d be happier out of the house,” said\\nGuerchard. He looked at the Duke again with inquiring, searching eyes.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said the Duke. “IS my tie crooked?”\\n\\n“Oh, no, no; it’s quite straight, your Grace,” said Guerchard, but he\\ndid not take his eyes from the Duke’s face.\\n\\nThe door opened, and in came M. Gournay-Martin, holding a bag in his\\nhand. “It seems to be settled that I’m never to sleep in my own house\\nagain,” he said in a grumbling tone.\\n\\n“There’s no reason to go,” said the Duke. “Why ARE you going?”\\n\\n“Danger,” said M. Gournay-Martin. “You read Lupin’s telegram: ‘I shall\\ncome to-night between a quarter to twelve and midnight to take the\\ncoronet.’ He knows that it was in my bedroom. Do you think I’m going to\\nsleep in that room with the chance of that scoundrel turning up and\\ncutting my throat?”\\n\\n“Oh, you can have a dozen policemen in the room if you like,” said the\\nDuke. “Can’t he, M. Guerchard?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Guerchard. “I can answer for it that you will be in\\nno danger, M. Gournay-Martin.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said the millionaire. “But all the same, outside is good\\nenough for me.”\\n\\nGermaine came into the room, cloaked and ready to start.\\n\\n“For once in a way you are ready first, papa,” she said. “Are you\\ncoming, Jacques?”\\n\\n“No; I think I’ll stay here, on the chance that Lupin is not bluffing,”\\nsaid the Duke. “I don’t think, myself, that I’m going to be gladdened\\nby the sight of him—in fact, I’m ready to bet against it. But you’re\\nall so certain about it that I really must stay on the chance. And,\\nafter all, there’s no doubt that he’s a man of immense audacity and\\nready to take any risk.”\\n\\n“Well, at any rate, if he does come he won’t find the diadem,” said M.\\nGournay-Martin, in a tone of triumph. “I’m taking it with me—I’ve got\\nit here.” And he held up his bag.\\n\\n“You are?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes, I am,” said M. Gournay-Martin firmly.\\n\\n“Do you think it’s wise?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Why not?” said M. Gournay-Martin.\\n\\n“If Lupin’s really made up his mind to collar that coronet, and if\\nyou’re so sure that, in spite of all these safeguards, he’s going to\\nmake the attempt, it seems to me that you’re taking a considerable\\nrisk. He asked you to have it ready for him in your bedroom. He didn’t\\nsay which bedroom.”\\n\\n“Good Lord! I never thought of that!” said M. Gournay-Martin, with an\\nair of sudden and very lively alarm.\\n\\n“His Grace is right,” said Guerchard. “It would be exactly like Lupin\\nto send that telegram to drive you out of the house with the coronet to\\nsome place where you would be less protected. That is exactly one of\\nhis tricks.”\\n\\n“Good Heavens!” said the millionaire, pulling out his keys and\\nunlocking the bag. He opened it, paused hesitatingly, and snapped it to\\nagain.\\n\\n“Half a minute,” he said. “I want a word with you, Duke.”\\n\\nHe led the way out of the drawing-room door and the Duke followed him.\\nHe shut the door and said in a whisper:\\n\\n“In a case like this, I suspect everybody.”\\n\\n“Everybody suspects everybody, apparently,” said the Duke. “Are you\\nsure you don’t suspect me?”\\n\\n“Now, now, this is no time for joking,” said the millionaire\\nimpatiently. “What do you think about Guerchard?”\\n\\n“About Guerchard?” said the Duke. “What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Do you think I can put full confidence in Guerchard?” said M.\\nGournay-Martin.\\n\\n“Oh, I think so,” said the Duke. “Besides, I shall be here to look\\nafter Guerchard. And, though I wouldn’t undertake to answer for Lupin,\\nI think I can answer for Guerchard. If he tries to escape with the\\ncoronet, I will wring his neck for you with pleasure. It would do me\\ngood. And it would do Guerchard good, too.”\\n\\nThe millionaire stood reflecting for a minute or two. Then he said,\\n“Very good; I’ll trust him.”\\n\\nHardly had the door closed behind the millionaire and the Duke, when\\nGuerchard crossed the room quickly to Germaine and drew from his pocket\\nthe photograph of Victoire and the young man.\\n\\n“Do you know this photograph of his Grace, mademoiselle?” he said\\nquickly.\\n\\nGermaine took the photograph and looked at it.\\n\\n“It’s rather faded,” she said.\\n\\n“Yes; it’s about ten years old,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“I seem to know the face of the woman,” said Germaine. “But if it’s ten\\nyears old it certainly isn’t the photograph of the Duke.”\\n\\n“But it’s like him?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, it’s like the Duke as he is now—at least, it’s a little like\\nhim. But it’s not like the Duke as he was ten years ago. He has changed\\nso,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“Oh, has he?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Yes; there was that exhausting journey of his—and then his illness.\\nThe doctors gave up all hope of him, you know.”\\n\\n“Oh, did they?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Yes; at Montevideo. But his health is quite restored now.”\\n\\nThe door opened and the millionaire and the Duke came into the room. M.\\nGournay-Martin set his bag upon the table, unlocked it, and with a\\nsolemn air took out the case which held the coronet. He opened it; and\\nthey looked at it.\\n\\n“Isn’t it beautiful?” he said with a sigh.\\n\\n“Marvellous!” said the Duke.\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin closed the case, and said solemnly:\\n\\n“There is danger, M. Guerchard, so I am going to trust the coronet to\\nyou. You are the defender of my hearth and home—you are the proper\\nperson to guard the coronet. I take it that you have no objection?”\\n\\n“Not the slightest, M. Gournay-Martin,” said Guerchard. “It’s exactly\\nwhat I wanted you to ask me to do.”\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin hesitated. Then he handed the coronet to Guerchard,\\nsaying with a frank and noble air, “I have every confidence in you, M.\\nGuerchard.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Good-night,” said M. Gournay-Martin.\\n\\n“Good-night, M. Guerchard,” said Germaine.\\n\\n“I think, after all, I’ll change my mind and go with you. I’m very\\nshort of sleep,” said the Duke. “Good-night, M. Guerchard.”\\n\\n“You’re never going too, your Grace!” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“Why, you don’t want me to stay, do you?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard slowly.\\n\\n“I think I would rather go to bed,” said the Duke gaily.\\n\\n“Are you afraid?” said Guerchard, and there was challenge, almost an\\ninsolent challenge, in his tone.\\n\\nThere was a pause. The Duke frowned slightly with a reflective air.\\nThen he drew himself up; and said a little haughtily:\\n\\n“You’ve certainly found the way to make me stay, M. Guerchard.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes; stay, stay,” said M. Gournay-Martin hastily. “It’s an\\nexcellent idea, excellent. You’re the very man to help M. Guerchard,\\nDuke. You’re an intrepid explorer, used to danger and resourceful,\\nabsolutely fearless.”\\n\\n“Do you really mean to say you’re not going home to bed, Jacques?” said\\nGermaine, disregarding her father’s wish with her usual frankness.\\n\\n“No; I’m going to stay with M. Guerchard,” said the Duke slowly.\\n\\n“Well, you will be fresh to go to the Princess’s to-morrow night.” said\\nGermaine petulantly. “You didn’t get any sleep at all last night, you\\ncouldn’t have. You left Charmerace at eight o’clock; you were motoring\\nall the night, and only got to Paris at six o’clock this morning.”\\n\\n“Motoring all night, from eight o’clock to six!” muttered Guerchard\\nunder his breath.\\n\\n“Oh, that will be all right,” said the Duke carelessly. “This\\ninteresting affair is to be over by midnight, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“Well, I warn you that, tired or fresh, you will have to come with me\\nto the Princess’s to-morrow night. All Paris will be there—all Paris,\\nthat is, who are in Paris.”\\n\\n“Oh, I shall be fresh enough,” said the Duke.\\n\\nThey went out of the drawing-room and down the stairs, all four of\\nthem. There was an alert readiness about Guerchard, as if he were ready\\nto spring. He kept within a foot of the Duke right to the front door.\\nThe detective in charge opened it; and they went down the steps to the\\ntaxi-cab which was awaiting them. The Duke kissed Germaine’s fingers\\nand handed her into the taxi-cab.\\n\\nM. Gournay-Martin paused at the cab-door, and turned and said, with a\\npathetic air, “Am I never to sleep in my own house again?” He got into\\nthe cab and drove off.\\n\\nThe Duke turned and came up the steps, followed by Guerchard. In the\\nhall he took his opera-hat and coat from the stand, and went upstairs.\\nHalf-way up the flight he paused and said:\\n\\n“Where shall we wait for Lupin, M. Guerchard? In the drawing-room, or\\nin M. Gournay-Martin’s bedroom?”\\n\\n“Oh, the drawing-room,” said Guerchard. “I think it very unlikely that\\nLupin will look for the coronet in M. Gournay-Martin’s bedroom. He\\nwould know very well that that is the last place to find it now.”\\n\\nThe Duke went on into the drawing-room. At the door Guerchard stopped\\nand said: “I will just go and post my men, your Grace.”\\n\\n“Very good,” said the Duke; and he went into the drawing-room.\\n\\nHe sat down, lighted a cigarette, and yawned. Then he took out his\\nwatch and looked at it.\\n\\n“Another twenty minutes,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\nTHE DUKE GOES\\n\\n\\nWhen Guerchard joined the Duke in the drawing-room, he had lost his\\ncalm air and was looking more than a little nervous. He moved about the\\nroom uneasily, fingering the bric-a-brac, glancing at the Duke and\\nlooking quickly away from him again. Then he came to a standstill on\\nthe hearth-rug with his back to the fireplace.\\n\\n“Do you think it’s quite safe to stand there, at least with your back\\nto the hearth? If Lupin dropped through that opening suddenly, he’d\\ncatch you from behind before you could wink twice,” said the Duke, in a\\ntone of remonstrance.\\n\\n“There would always be your Grace to come to my rescue,” said\\nGuerchard; and there was an ambiguous note in his voice, while his\\npiercing eyes now rested fixed on the Duke’s face. They seemed never to\\nleave it; they explored, and explored it.\\n\\n“It’s only a suggestion,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“This is rather nervous work, don’t you know.”\\n\\n“Yes; and of course you’re hardly fit for it,” said Guerchard. “If I’d\\nknown about your break-down in your car last night, I should have\\nhesitated about asking you—”\\n\\n“A break-down?” interrupted the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes, you left Charmerace at eight o’clock last night. And you only\\nreached Paris at six this morning. You couldn’t have had a very\\nhigh-power car?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“I had a 100 h.-p. car,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Then you must have had a devil of a break-down,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Yes, it was pretty bad, but I’ve known worse,” said the Duke\\ncarelessly. “It lost me about three hours: oh, at least three hours.\\nI’m not a first-class repairer, though I know as much about an engine\\nas most motorists.”\\n\\n“And there was nobody there to help you repair it?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“No; M. Gournay-Martin could not let me have his chauffeur to drive me\\nto Paris, because he was keeping him to help guard the château. And of\\ncourse there was nobody on the road, because it was two o’clock in the\\nmorning.”\\n\\n“Yes, there was no one,” said Guerchard slowly.\\n\\n“Not a soul,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“It was unfortunate,” said Guerchard; and there was a note of\\nincredulity in his voice.\\n\\n“My having to repair the car myself?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes, of course,” said Guerchard, hesitating a little over the assent.\\n\\nThe Duke dropped the end of his cigarette into a tray, and took out his\\ncase. He held it out towards Guerchard, and said, “A cigarette? or\\nperhaps you prefer your caporal?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do, but all the same I’ll have one,” said Guerchard, coming\\nquickly across the room. And he took a cigarette from the case, and\\nlooked at it.\\n\\n“All the same, all this is very curious,” he said in a new tone, a\\nchallenging, menacing, accusing tone.\\n\\n“What?” said the Duke, looking at him curiously.\\n\\n“Everything: your cigarettes ... the salvias ... the photograph that\\nBonavent found in Victoire’s prayer-book ... that man in motoring dress\\n... and finally, your break-down,” said Guerchard; and the accusation\\nand the threat rang clearer.\\n\\nThe Duke rose from his chair quickly and said haughtily, in icy tones:\\n“M. Guerchard, you’ve been drinking!”\\n\\nHe went to the chair on which he had set his overcoat and his hat, and\\npicked them up. Guerchard sprang in front of him, barring his way, and\\ncried in a shaky voice: “No; don’t go! You mustn’t go!”\\n\\n“What do you mean?” said the Duke, and paused. “What DO you mean?”\\n\\nGuerchard stepped back, and ran his hand over his forehead. He was very\\npale, and his forehead was clammy to his touch:\\n\\n“No ... I beg your pardon ... I beg your pardon, your Grace ... I must\\nbe going mad,” he stammered.\\n\\n“It looks very like it,” said the Duke coldly.\\n\\n“What I mean to say is,” said Guerchard in a halting, uncertain voice,\\n“what I mean to say is: help me ... I want you to stay here, to help me\\nagainst Lupin, you understand. Will you, your Grace?”\\n\\n“Yes, certainly; of course I will, if you want me to,” said the Duke,\\nin a more gentle voice. “But you seem awfully upset, and you’re\\nupsetting me too. We shan’t have a nerve between us soon, if you don’t\\npull yourself together.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, please excuse me,” muttered Guerchard.\\n\\n“Very good,” said the Duke. “But what is it we’re going to do?”\\n\\nGuerchard hesitated. He pulled out his handkerchief, and mopped his\\nforehead: “Well ... the coronet ... is it in this case?” he said in a\\nshaky voice, and set the case on the table.\\n\\n“Of course it is,” said the Duke impatiently.\\n\\nGuerchard opened the case, and the coronet sparkled and gleamed\\nbrightly in the electric light: “Yes, it is there; you see it?” said\\nGuerchard.\\n\\n“Yes, I see it; well?” said the Duke, looking at him in some\\nbewilderment, so unlike himself did he seem.\\n\\n“We’re going to wait,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“What for?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Lupin,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Lupin? And you actually do believe that, just as in a fairy tale, when\\nthat clock strikes twelve, Lupin will enter and take the coronet?”\\n\\n“Yes, I do; I do,” said Guerchard with stubborn conviction. And he\\nsnapped the case to.\\n\\n“This is most exciting,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“You’re sure it doesn’t bore you?” said Guerchard huskily.\\n\\n“Not a bit of it,” said the Duke, with cheerful derision. “To make the\\nacquaintance of this scoundrel who has fooled you for ten years is as\\ncharming a way of spending the evening as I can think of.”\\n\\n“You say that to me?” said Guerchard with a touch of temper.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Duke, with a challenging smile. “To you.”\\n\\nHe sat down in an easy chair by the table. Guerchard sat down in a\\nchair on the other side of it, and set his elbows on it. They were\\nsilent.\\n\\nSuddenly the Duke said, “Somebody’s coming.”\\n\\nGuerchard started, and said: “No, I don’t hear any one.”\\n\\nThen there came distinctly the sound of a footstep and a knock at the\\ndoor.\\n\\n“You’ve got keener ears than I,” said Guerchard grudgingly. “In all\\nthis business you’ve shown the qualities of a very promising\\ndetective.” He rose, went to the door, and unlocked it.\\n\\nBonavent came in: “I’ve brought you the handcuffs, sir,” he said,\\nholding them out. “Shall I stay with you?”\\n\\n“No,” said Guerchard. “You’ve two men at the back door, and two at the\\nfront, and a man in every room on the ground-floor?”\\n\\n“Yes, and I’ve got three men on every other floor,” said Bonavent, in a\\ntone of satisfaction.\\n\\n“And the house next door?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“There are a dozen men in it,” said Bonavent. “No communication between\\nthe two houses is possible any longer.”\\n\\nGuerchard watched the Duke’s face with intent eyes. Not a shadow\\nflickered its careless serenity.\\n\\n“If any one tries to enter the house, collar him. If need be, fire on\\nhim,” said Guerchard firmly. “That is my order; go and tell the\\nothers.”\\n\\n“Very good, sir,” said Bonavent; and he went out of the room.\\n\\n“By Jove, we are in a regular fortress,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“It’s even more of a fortress than you think, your Grace. I’ve four men\\non that landing,” said Guerchard, nodding towards the door.\\n\\n“Oh, have you?” said the Duke, with a sudden air of annoyance.\\n\\n“You don’t like that?” said Guerchard quickly.\\n\\n“I should jolly well think not,” said the Duke. “With these\\nprecautions, Lupin will never be able to get into this room at all.”\\n\\n“He’ll find it a pretty hard job,” said Guerchard, smiling. “Unless he\\nfalls from the ceiling, or unless—”\\n\\n“Unless you’re Arsène Lupin,” interrupted the Duke.\\n\\n“In that case, you’d be another, your Grace,” said Guerchard.\\n\\nThey both laughed. The Duke rose, yawned, picked up his coat and hat,\\nand said, “Ah, well, I’m off to bed.”\\n\\n“What?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Well,” said the Duke, yawning again, “I was staying to see Lupin. As\\nthere’s no longer any chance of seeing him—”\\n\\n“But there is ... there is ... so stay,” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“Do you still cling to that notion?” said the Duke wearily.\\n\\n“We SHALL see him,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Nonsense!” said the Duke.\\n\\nGuerchard lowered his voice and said with an air of the deepest\\nsecrecy: “He’s already here, your Grace.”\\n\\n“Lupin? Here?” cried the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes; Lupin,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Where?” cried the astonished Duke.\\n\\n“He is,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“As one of your men?” said the Duke eagerly.\\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Guerchard, watching him closely.\\n\\n“Well, but, well, but—if he’s here we’ve got him.... He is going to\\nturn up,” said the Duke triumphantly; and he set down his hat on the\\ntable beside the coronet.\\n\\n“I hope so,” said Guerchard. “But will he dare to?”\\n\\n“How do you mean?” said the Duke, with a puzzled air.\\n\\n“Well, you have said yourself that this is a fortress. An hour ago,\\nperhaps, Lupin was resolved to enter this room, but is he now?”\\n\\n“I see what you mean,” said the Duke, in a tone of disappointment.\\n\\n“Yes; you see that now it needs the devil’s own courage. He must risk\\neverything to gain everything, and throw off the mask. Is Lupin going\\nto throw himself into the wolf’s jaws? I dare not think it. What do you\\nthink about it?”\\n\\nGuerchard’s husky voice had hardened to a rough harshness; there was a\\nring of acute anxiety in it, and under the anxiety a faint note of\\nchallenge, of a challenge that dare not make itself too distinct. His\\nanxious, challenging eyes burned on the face of the Duke, as if they\\nstrove with all intensity to pierce a mask.\\n\\nThe Duke looked at him curiously, as if he were trying to divine what\\nhe would be at, but with a careless curiosity, as if it were a matter\\nof indifference to him what the detective’s object was; then he said\\ncarelessly: “Well, you ought to know better than I. You have known him\\nfor ten years ....” He paused, and added with just the faintest stress\\nin his tone, “At least, by reputation.”\\n\\nThe anxiety in the detective’s face grew plainer, it almost gave him\\nthe air of being unnerved; and he said quickly, in a jerky voice: “Yes,\\nand I know his way of acting too. During the last ten years I have\\nlearnt to unravel his intrigues—to understand and anticipate his\\nmanoeuvres.... Oh, his is a clever system! ... Instead of lying low, as\\nyou’d expect, he attacks his opponent ... openly.... He confuses him—at\\nleast, he tries to.” He smiled a half-confident, a half-doubtful smile,\\n“It is a mass of entangled, mysterious combinations. I’ve been caught\\nin them myself again and again. You smile?”\\n\\n“It interests me so,” said the Duke, in a tone of apology.\\n\\n“Oh, it interests me,” said Guerchard, with a snarl. “But this time I\\nsee my way clearly. No more tricks—no more secret paths ... We’re\\nfighting in the light of day.” He paused, and said in a clear, sneering\\nvoice, “Lupin has pluck, perhaps, but it’s only thief’s pluck.”\\n\\n“Oh, is it?” said the Duke sharply, and there was a sudden faint\\nglitter in his eyes.\\n\\n“Yes; rogues have very poor qualities,” sneered Guerchard.\\n\\n“One can’t have everything,” said the Duke quietly; but his languid air\\nhad fallen from him.\\n\\n“Their ambushes, their attacks, their fine tactics aren’t up to much,”\\nsaid Guerchard, smiling contemptuously.\\n\\n“You go a trifle too far, I think,” said the Duke, smiling with equal\\ncontempt.\\n\\nThey looked one another in the eyes with a long, lingering look. They\\nhad suddenly the air of fencers who have lost their tempers, and are\\ntwisting the buttons off their foils.\\n\\n“Not a bit of it, your Grace,” said Guerchard; and his voice lingered\\non the words “your Grace” with a contemptuous stress. “This famous\\nLupin is immensely overrated.”\\n\\n“However, he has done some things which aren’t half bad,” said the\\nDuke, with his old charming smile.\\n\\nHe had the air of a duelist drawing his blade lovingly through his\\nfingers before he falls to.\\n\\n“Oh, has he?” said Guerchard scornfully.\\n\\n“Yes; one must be fair. Last night’s burglary, for instance: it is not\\nunheard of, but it wasn’t half bad. And that theft of the motorcars: it\\nwas a neat piece of work,” said the Duke in a gentle, insolent voice,\\ninfinitely aggravating.\\n\\nGuerchard snorted scornfully.\\n\\n“And a robbery at the British Embassy, another at the Treasury, and a\\nthird at M. Lepine’s—all in the same week—it wasn’t half bad, don’t you\\nknow?” said the Duke, in the same gentle, irritating voice.\\n\\n“Oh, no, it wasn’t. But—”\\n\\n“And the time when he contrived to pass as Guerchard—the Great\\nGuerchard—do you remember that?” the Duke interrupted. “Come, come—to\\ngive the devil his due—between ourselves—it wasn’t half bad.”\\n\\n“No,” snarled Guerchard. “But he has done better than that lately....\\nWhy don’t you speak of that?”\\n\\n“Of what?” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Of the time when he passed as the Duke of Charmerace,” snapped\\nGuerchard.\\n\\n“What! Did he do that?” cried the Duke; and then he added slowly, “But,\\nyou know, I’m like you—I’m so easy to imitate.”\\n\\n“What would have been amusing, your Grace, would have been to get as\\nfar as actual marriage,” said Guerchard more calmly.\\n\\n“Oh, if he had wanted to,” said the Duke; and he threw out his hands.\\n“But you know—married life—for Lupin.”\\n\\n“A large fortune ... a pretty girl,” said Guerchard, in a mocking tone.\\n\\n“He must be in love with some one else,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“A thief, perhaps,” sneered Guerchard.\\n\\n“Like himself.... And then, if you wish to know what I think, he must\\nhave found his fiancée rather trying,” said the Duke, with his charming\\nsmile.\\n\\n“After all, it’s pitiful—heartrending, you must admit it, that, on the\\nvery eve of his marriage, he was such a fool as to throw off the mask.\\nAnd yet at bottom it’s quite logical; it’s Lupin coming out through\\nCharmerace. He had to grab at the dowry at the risk of losing the\\ngirl,” said Guerchard, in a reflective tone; but his eyes were intent\\non the face of the Duke.\\n\\n“Perhaps that’s what one should call a marriage of reason,” said the\\nDuke, with a faint smile.\\n\\n“What a fall!” said Guerchard, in a taunting voice. “To be expected,\\neagerly, at the Princess’s to-morrow evening, and to pass the evening\\nin a police-station ... to have intended in a month’s time, as the Duke\\nof Charmerace, to mount the steps of the Madeleine with all pomp and to\\nfall down the father-in-law’s staircase this evening—this very\\nevening”—his voice rose suddenly on a note of savage triumph—“with the\\nhandcuffs on! What? Is that a good enough revenge for Guerchard—for\\nthat poor old idiot, Guerchard? The rogues’ Brummel in a convict’s cap!\\nThe gentleman-burglar in a gaol! For Lupin it’s only a trifling\\nannoyance, but for a duke it’s a disaster! Come, in your turn, be\\nfrank: don’t you find that amusing?”\\n\\nThe Duke rose quietly, and said coldly, “Have you finished?”\\n\\n“DO you?” cried Guerchard; and he rose and faced him.\\n\\n“Oh, yes; I find it quite amusing,” said the Duke lightly.\\n\\n“And so do I,” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“No; you’re frightened,” said the Duke calmly.\\n\\n“Frightened!” cried Guerchard, with a savage laugh.\\n\\n“Yes, you’re frightened,” said the Duke. “And don’t think, policeman,\\nthat because I’m familiar with you, I throw off a mask. I don’t wear\\none. I’ve none to throw off. I AM the Duke of Charmerace.”\\n\\n“You lie! You escaped from the Santé four years ago. You are Lupin! I\\nrecognize you now.”\\n\\n“Prove it,” said the Duke scornfully.\\n\\n“I will!” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“You won’t. I AM the Duke of Charmerace.”\\n\\nGuerchard laughed wildly.\\n\\n“Don’t laugh. You know nothing—nothing, dear boy,” said the Duke\\ntauntingly.\\n\\n“Dear boy?” cried Guerchard triumphantly, as if the word had been a\\nconfession.\\n\\n“What do I risk?” said the Duke, with scathing contempt. “Can you\\narrest me? ... You can arrest Lupin ... but arrest the Duke of\\nCharmerace, an honourable gentleman, member of the Jockey Club, and of\\nthe Union, residing at his house, 34 B, University Street ... arrest\\nthe Duke of Charmerace, the fiance of Mademoiselle Gournay-Martin?”\\n\\n“Scoundrel!” cried Guerchard, pale with sudden, helpless fury.\\n\\n“Well, do it,” taunted the Duke. “Be an ass.... Make yourself the\\nlaughing-stock of Paris ... call your coppers in. Have you a proof—one\\nsingle proof? Not one.”\\n\\n“Oh, I shall get them,” howled Guerchard, beside himself.\\n\\n“I think you may,” said the Duke coolly. “And you might be able to\\narrest me next week ... the day after to-morrow perhaps ... perhaps\\nnever ... but not to-night, that’s certain.”\\n\\n“Oh, if only somebody could hear you!” gasped Guerchard.\\n\\n“Now, don’t excite yourself,” said the Duke. “That won’t produce any\\nproofs for you.... The fact is, M. Formery told you the truth when he\\nsaid that, when it is a case of Lupin, you lose your head. Ah, that\\nFormery—there is an intelligent man if you like.”\\n\\n“At all events, the coronet is safe ... to-night—”\\n\\n“Wait, my good chap ... wait,” said the Duke slowly; and then he\\nsnapped out: “Do you know what’s behind that door?” and he flung out\\nhis hand towards the door of the inner drawing-room, with a mysterious,\\nsinister air.\\n\\n“What?” cried Guerchard; and he whipped round and faced the door, with\\nhis eyes starting out of his head.\\n\\n“Get out, you funk!” said the Duke, with a great laugh.\\n\\n“Hang you!” said Guerchard shrilly.\\n\\n“I said that you were going to be absolutely pitiable,” said the Duke,\\nand he laughed again cruelly.\\n\\n“Oh, go on talking, do!” cried Guerchard, mopping his forehead.\\n\\n“Absolutely pitiable,” said the Duke, with a cold, disquieting\\ncertainty. “As the hand of that clock moves nearer and nearer midnight,\\nyou will grow more and more terrified.” He paused, and then shouted\\nviolently, “Attention!”\\n\\nGuerchard jumped; and then he swore.\\n\\n“Your nerves are on edge,” said the Duke, laughing.\\n\\n“Joker!” snarled Guerchard.\\n\\n“Oh, you’re as brave as the next man. But who can stand the anguish of\\nthe unknown thing which is bound to happen? ... I’m right. You feel it,\\nyou’re sure of it. At the end of these few fixed minutes an inevitable,\\nfated event must happen. Don’t shrug your shoulders, man; you’re green\\nwith fear.”\\n\\nThe Duke was no longer a smiling, cynical dandy. There emanated from\\nhim an impression of vivid, terrible force. His voice had deepened. It\\nthrilled with a consciousness of irresistible power; it was\\noverwhelming, paralyzing. His eyes were terrible.\\n\\n“My men are outside ... I’m armed,” stammered Guerchard.\\n\\n“Child! Bear in mind ... bear in mind that it is always when you have\\nforeseen everything, arranged everything, made every combination ...\\nbear in mind that it is always then that some accident dashes your\\nwhole structure to the ground,” said the Duke, in the same deep,\\nthrilling voice. “Remember that it is always at the very moment at\\nwhich you are going to triumph that he beats you, that he only lets you\\nreach the top of the ladder to throw you more easily to the ground.”\\n\\n“Confess, then, that you are Lupin,” muttered Guerchard.\\n\\n“I thought you were sure of it,” said the Duke in a jeering tone.\\n\\nGuerchard dragged the handcuffs out of his pocket, and said between his\\nteeth, “I don’t know what prevents me, my boy.”\\n\\nThe Duke drew himself up, and said haughtily, “That’s enough.”\\n\\n“What?” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“I say that that’s enough,” said the Duke sternly. “It’s all very well\\nfor me to play at being familiar with you, but don’t you call me ‘my\\nboy.’”\\n\\n“Oh, you won’t impose on me much longer,” muttered Guerchard; and his\\nbloodshot, haggard eyes scanned the Duke’s face in an agony, an anguish\\nof doubting impotence.\\n\\n“If I’m Lupin, arrest me,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“I’ll arrest you in three minutes from now, or the coronet will be\\nuntouched,” cried Guerchard in a firmer tone.\\n\\n“In three minutes from now the coronet will have been stolen; and you\\nwill not arrest me,” said the Duke, in a tone of chilling certainty.\\n\\n“But I will! I swear I will!” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“Don’t swear any foolish oaths! ... THERE ARE ONLY TWO MINUTES LEFT,”\\nsaid the Duke; and he drew a revolver from his pocket.\\n\\n“No, you don’t!” cried Guerchard, drawing a revolver in his turn.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” said the Duke, with an air of surprise. “You\\nhaven’t forbidden me to shoot Lupin. I have my revolver ready, since\\nhe’s going to come.... THERE’S ONLY A MINUTE LEFT.”\\n\\n“There are plenty of us,” said Guerchard; and he went towards the door.\\n\\n“Funk!” said the Duke scornfully.\\n\\nGuerchard turned sharply. “Very well,” he said, “I’ll stick it out\\nalone.”\\n\\n“How rash!” sneered the Duke.\\n\\nGuerchard ground his teeth. He was panting; his bloodshot eyes rolled\\nin their sockets; the beads of cold sweat stood out on his forehead. He\\ncame back towards the table on unsteady feet, trembling from head to\\nfoot in the last excitation of the nerves. He kept jerking his head to\\nshake away the mist which kept dimming his eyes.\\n\\n“At your slightest gesture, at your slightest movement, I’ll fire,” he\\nsaid jerkily, and covered the Duke with his revolver.\\n\\n“I call myself the Duke of Charmerace. You will be arrested to-morrow!”\\nsaid the Duke, in a compelling, thrilling voice.\\n\\n“I don’t care a curse!” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“Only FIFTY SECONDS!” said the Duke.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” muttered Guerchard huskily. And his eyes shot from the\\ncoronet to the Duke, from the Duke to the coronet.\\n\\n“In fifty seconds the coronet will be stolen,” said the Duke.\\n\\n“No!” cried Guerchard furiously.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Duke coldly.\\n\\n“No! no! no!” cried Guerchard.\\n\\nTheir eyes turned to the clock.\\n\\nTo Guerchard the hands seemed to be standing still. He could have sworn\\nat them for their slowness.\\n\\nThen the first stroke rang out; and the eyes of the two men met like\\ncrossing blades. Twice the Duke made the slightest movement. Twice\\nGuerchard started forward to meet it.\\n\\nAt the last stroke both their hands shot out. Guerchard’s fell heavily\\non the case which held the coronet. The Duke’s fell on the brim of his\\nhat; and he picked it up.\\n\\nGuerchard gasped and choked. Then he cried triumphantly:\\n\\n“I HAVE it; now then, have I won? Have I been fooled this time? Has\\nLupin got the coronet?”\\n\\n“It doesn’t look like it. But are you quite sure?” said the Duke gaily.\\n\\n“Sure?” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“It’s only the weight of it,” said the Duke, repressing a laugh.\\n“Doesn’t it strike you that it’s just a trifle light?”\\n\\n“What?” cried Guerchard.\\n\\n“This is merely an imitation.” said the Duke, with a gentle laugh.\\n\\n“Hell and damnation!” howled Guerchard. “Bonavent! Dieusy!”\\n\\nThe door flew open, and half a dozen detectives rushed in.\\n\\nGuerchard sank into a chair, stupefied, paralyzed; this blow, on the\\ntop of the strain of the struggle with the Duke, had broken him.\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” said the Duke sadly, “the coronet has been stolen.”\\n\\nThey broke into cries of surprise and bewilderment, surrounding the\\ngasping Guerchard with excited questions.\\n\\nThe Duke walked quietly out of the room.\\n\\nGuerchard sobbed twice; his eyes opened, and in a dazed fashion\\nwandered from face to face; he said faintly: “Where is he?”\\n\\n“Where’s who?” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“The Duke—the Duke!” gasped Guerchard.\\n\\n“Why, he’s gone!” said Bonavent.\\n\\nGuerchard staggered to his feet and cried hoarsely, frantically: “Stop\\nhim from leaving the house! Follow him! Arrest him! Catch him before he\\ngets home!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\nLUPIN COMES HOME\\n\\n\\nThe cold light of the early September morning illumined but dimly the\\ncharming smoking-room of the Duke of Charmerace in his house at 34 B,\\nUniversity Street, though it stole in through two large windows. The\\nsmoking-room was on the first floor; and the Duke’s bedroom opened into\\nit. It was furnished in the most luxurious fashion, but with a taste\\nwhich nowadays infrequently accompanies luxury. The chairs were of the\\nmost comfortable, but their lines were excellent; the couch against the\\nwall, between the two windows, was the last word in the matter of\\ncomfort. The colour scheme, of a light greyish-blue, was almost too\\nbright for a man’s room; it would have better suited a boudoir. It\\nsuggested that the owner of the room enjoyed an uncommon lightness and\\ncheerfulness of temperament. On the walls, with wide gaps between them\\nso that they did not clash, hung three or four excellent pictures. Two\\nballet-girls by Degas, a group of shepherdesses and shepherds, in pink\\nand blue and white beribboned silk, by Fragonard, a portrait of a woman\\nby Bastien-Lepage, a charming Corot, and two Conder fans showed that\\nthe taste of their fortunate owner was at any rate eclectic. At the end\\nof the room was, of all curious things, the opening into the well of a\\nlift. The doors of it were open, though the lift itself was on some\\nother floor. To the left of the opening stood a book-case, its shelves\\nloaded with books of a kind rather suited to a cultivated, thoughtful\\nman than to an idle dandy.\\n\\nBeside the window, half-hidden, and peering through the side of the\\ncurtain into the street, stood M. Charolais. But it was hardly the M.\\nCharolais who had paid M. Gournay-Martin that visit at the château de\\nCharmerace, and departed so firmly in the millionaire’s favourite\\nmotor-car. This was a paler M. Charolais; he lacked altogether the\\nrich, ruddy complexion of the millionaire’s visitor. His nose, too, was\\nthinner, and showed none of the ripe acquaintance with the vintages of\\nthe world which had been so plainly displayed on it during its owner’s\\nvisit to the country. Again, hair and eyebrows were no longer black,\\nbut fair; and his hair was no longer curly and luxuriant, but thin and\\nlank. His moustache had vanished, and along with it the dress of a\\nwell-to-do provincial man of business. He wore a livery of the\\nCharmeraces, and at that early morning hour had not yet assumed the\\nblue waistcoat which is an integral part of it. Indeed it would have\\nrequired an acute and experienced observer to recognize in him the\\nbogus purchaser of the Mercrac. Only his eyes, his close-set eyes, were\\nunchanged.\\n\\nWalking restlessly up and down the middle of the room, keeping out of\\nsight of the windows, was Victoire. She wore a very anxious air, as did\\nCharolais too. By the door stood Bernard Charolais; and his natural,\\nboyish timidity, to judge from his frightened eyes, had assumed an\\nacute phase.\\n\\n“By the Lord, we’re done!” cried Charolais, starting back from the\\nwindow. “That was the front-door bell.”\\n\\n“No, it was only the hall clock,” said Bernard.\\n\\n“That’s seven o’clock! Oh, where can he be?” said Victoire, wringing\\nher hands. “The coup was fixed for midnight.... Where can he be?”\\n\\n“They must be after him,” said Charolais. “And he daren’t come home.”\\nGingerly he drew back the curtain and resumed his watch.\\n\\n“I’ve sent down the lift to the bottom, in case he should come back by\\nthe secret entrance,” said Victoire; and she went to the opening into\\nthe well of the lift and stood looking down it, listening with all her\\nears.\\n\\n“Then why, in the devil’s name, have you left the doors open?” cried\\nCharolais irritably. “How do you expect the lift to come up if the\\ndoors are open?”\\n\\n“I must be off my head!” cried Victoire.\\n\\nShe stepped to the side of the lift and pressed a button. The doors\\nclosed, and there was a grunting click of heavy machinery settling into\\na new position.\\n\\n“Suppose we telephone to Justin at the Passy house?” said Victoire.\\n\\n“What on earth’s the good of that?” said Charolais impatiently. “Justin\\nknows no more than we do. How can he know any more?”\\n\\n“The best thing we can do is to get out,” said Bernard, in a shaky\\nvoice.\\n\\n“No, no; he will come. I haven’t given up hope,” Victoire protested.\\n“He’s sure to come; and he may need us.”\\n\\n“But, hang it all! Suppose the police come! Suppose they ransack his\\npapers.... He hasn’t told us what to do ... we are not ready for\\nthem.... What are we to do?” cried Charolais, in a tone of despair.\\n\\n“Well, I’m worse off than you are; and I’m not making a fuss. If the\\npolice come they’ll arrest me,” said Victoire.\\n\\n“Perhaps they’ve arrested him,” said Bernard, in his shaky voice.\\n\\n“Don’t talk like that,” said Victoire fretfully. “Isn’t it bad enough\\nto wait and wait, without your croaking like a scared crow?”\\n\\nShe started again her pacing up and down the room, twisting her hands,\\nand now and again moistening her dry lips with the tip of her tongue.\\n\\nPresently she said: “Are those two plain-clothes men still there\\nwatching?” And in her anxiety she came a step nearer the window.\\n\\n“Keep away from the window!” snapped Charolais. “Do you want to be\\nrecognized, you great idiot?” Then he added, more quietly, “They’re\\nstill there all right, curse them, in front of the cafe.... Hullo!”\\n\\n“What is it, now?” cried Victoire, starting.\\n\\n“A copper and a detective running,” said Charolais. “They are running\\nfor all they’re worth.”\\n\\n“Are they coming this way?” said Victoire; and she ran to the door and\\ncaught hold of the handle.\\n\\n“No,” said Charolais.\\n\\n“Thank goodness!” said Victoire.\\n\\n“They’re running to the two men watching the house ... they’re telling\\nthem something. Oh, hang it, they’re all running down the street.”\\n\\n“This way? ... Are they coming this way?” cried Victoire faintly; and\\nshe pressed her hand to her side.\\n\\n“They are!” cried Charolais. “They are!” And he dropped the curtain\\nwith an oath.\\n\\n“And he isn’t here! Suppose they come.... Suppose he comes to the front\\ndoor! They’ll catch him!” cried Victoire.\\n\\nThere came a startling peal at the front-door bell. They stood frozen\\nto stone, their eyes fixed on one another, staring.\\n\\nThe bell had hardly stopped ringing, when there was a slow, whirring\\nnoise. The doors of the lift flew open, and the Duke stepped out of it.\\nBut what a changed figure from the admirably dressed dandy who had\\nwalked through the startled detectives and out of the house of M.\\nGournay-Martin at midnight! He was pale, exhausted, almost fainting.\\nHis eyes were dim in a livid face; his lips were grey. He was panting\\nheavily. He was splashed with mud from head to foot: one sleeve of his\\ncoat was torn along half its length. The sole of his left-hand pump was\\nhalf off; and his cut foot showed white and red through the torn sock.\\n\\n“The master! The master!” cried Charolais in a tone of extravagant\\nrelief; and he danced round the room snapping his fingers.\\n\\n“You’re wounded?” cried Victoire.\\n\\n“No,” said Arsène Lupin.\\n\\nThe front-door bell rang out again, startling, threatening, terrifying.\\n\\nThe note of danger seemed to brace Lupin, to spur him to a last effort.\\n\\nHe pulled himself together, and said in a hoarse but steady voice:\\n“Your waistcoat, Charolais.... Go and open the door ... not too quickly\\n... fumble the bolts.... Bernard, shut the book-case. Victoire, get out\\nof sight, do you want to ruin us all? Be smart now, all of you. Be\\nsmart!”\\n\\nHe staggered past them into his bedroom, and slammed the door. Victoire\\nand Charolais hurried out of the room, through the anteroom, on to the\\nlanding. Victoire ran upstairs, Charolais went slowly down. Bernard\\npressed the button. The doors of the lift shut and there was a slow\\nwhirring as it went down. He pressed another button, and the book-case\\nslid slowly across and hid the opening into the lift-well. Bernard ran\\nout of the room and up the stairs.\\n\\nCharolais went to the front door and fumbled with the bolts. He bawled\\nthrough the door to the visitors not to be in such a hurry at that hour\\nin the morning; and they bawled furiously at him to be quick, and\\nknocked and rang again and again. He was fully three minutes fumbling\\nwith the bolts, which were already drawn. At last he opened the door an\\ninch or two, and looked out.\\n\\nOn the instant the door was dashed open, flinging him back against the\\nwall; and Bonavent and Dieusy rushed past him, up the stairs, as hard\\nas they could pelt. A brown-faced, nervous, active policeman followed\\nthem in and stopped to guard the door.\\n\\nOn the landing the detectives paused, and looked at one another,\\nhesitating.\\n\\n“Which way did he go?” said Bonavent. “We were on his very heels.”\\n\\n“I don’t know; but we’ve jolly well stopped his getting into his own\\nhouse; and that’s the main thing,” said Dieusy triumphantly.\\n\\n“But are you sure it was him?” said Bonavent, stepping into the\\nanteroom.\\n\\n“I can swear to it,” said Dieusy confidently; and he followed him.\\n\\nCharolais came rushing up the stairs and caught them up as they were\\nentering the smoking-room:\\n\\n“Here! What’s all this?” he cried. “You mustn’t come in here! His Grace\\nisn’t awake yet.”\\n\\n“Awake? Awake? Your precious Duke has been galloping all night,” cried\\nDieusy. “And he runs devilish well, too.”\\n\\nThe door of the bedroom opened; and Lupin stood on the threshold in\\nslippers and pyjamas.\\n\\n“What’s all this?” he snapped, with the irritation of a man whose sleep\\nhas been disturbed; and his tousled hair and eyes dim with exhaustion\\ngave him every appearance of being still heavy with sleep.\\n\\nThe eyes and mouths of Bonavent and Dieusy opened wide; and they stared\\nat him blankly, in utter bewilderment and wonder.\\n\\n“Is it you who are making all this noise?” said Lupin, frowning at\\nthem. “Why, I know you two; you’re in the service of M. Guerchard.”\\n\\n“Yes, your Grace,” stammered Bonavent.\\n\\n“Well, what are you doing here? What is it you want?” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Oh, nothing, your Grace ... nothing ... there’s been a mistake,”\\nstammered Bonavent.\\n\\n“A mistake?” said Lupin haughtily. “I should think there had been a\\nmistake. But I take it that this is Guerchard’s doing. I’d better deal\\nwith him directly. You two can go.” He turned to Charolais and added\\ncurtly, “Show them out.”\\n\\nCharolais opened the door, and the two detectives went out of the room\\nwith the slinking air of whipped dogs. They went down the stairs in\\nsilence, slowly, reflectively; and Charolais let them out of the front\\ndoor.\\n\\nAs they went down the steps Dieusy said: “What a howler! Guerchard\\nrisks getting the sack for this!”\\n\\n“I told you so,” said Bonavent. “A duke’s a duke.”\\n\\nWhen the door closed behind the two detectives Lupin tottered across\\nthe room, dropped on to the couch with a groan of exhaustion, and\\nclosed his eyes. Presently the door opened, Victoire came in, saw his\\nattitude of exhaustion, and with a startled cry ran to his side.\\n\\n“Oh, dearie! dearie!” she cried. “Pull yourself together! Oh, do try to\\npull yourself together.” She caught his cold hands and began to rub\\nthem, murmuring words of endearment like a mother over a young child.\\nLupin did not open his eyes; Charolais came in.\\n\\n“Some breakfast!” she cried. “Bring his breakfast ... he’s faint ...\\nhe’s had nothing to eat this morning. Can you eat some breakfast,\\ndearie?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Lupin faintly.\\n\\n“Hurry up with it,” said Victoire in urgent, imperative tones; and\\nCharolais left the room at a run.\\n\\n“Oh, what a life you lead!” said Victoire, or, to be exact, she wailed\\nit. “Are you never going to change? You’re as white as a sheet....\\nCan’t you speak, dearie?”\\n\\nShe stooped and lifted his legs on to the couch.\\n\\nHe stretched himself, and, without opening his eyes, said in a faint\\nvoice: “Oh, Victoire, what a fright I’ve had!”\\n\\n“You? You’ve been frightened?” cried Victoire, amazed.\\n\\n“Yes. You needn’t tell the others, though. But I’ve had a night of it\\n... I did play the fool so ... I must have been absolutely mad. Once I\\nhad changed the coronet under that fat old fool Gournay-Martin’s very\\neyes ... once you and Sonia were out of their clutches, all I had to do\\nwas to slip away. Did I? Not a bit of it! I stayed there out of sheer\\nbravado, just to score off Guerchard.... And then I ... I, who pride\\nmyself on being as cool as a cucumber ... I did the one thing I ought\\nnot to have done.... Instead of going quietly away as the Duke of\\nCharmerace ... what do you think I did? ... I bolted ... I started\\nrunning ... running like a thief.... In about two seconds I saw the\\nslip I had made. It did not take me longer; but that was too\\nlong—Guerchard’s men were on my track ... I was done for.”\\n\\n“Then Guerchard understood—he recognized you?” said Victoire anxiously.\\n\\n“As soon as the first paralysis had passed, Guerchard dared to see\\nclearly ... to see the truth,” said Lupin. “And then it was a chase.\\nThere were ten—fifteen of them on my heels. Out of breath—grunting,\\nfurious—a mob—a regular mob. I had passed the night before in a\\nmotor-car. I was dead beat. In fact, I was done for before I started\\n... and they were gaining ground all the time.”\\n\\n“Why didn’t you hide?” said Victoire.\\n\\n“For a long while they were too close. They must have been within five\\nfeet of me. I was done. Then I was crossing one of the bridges. ...\\nThere was the Seine ... handy ... I made up my mind that, rather than\\nbe taken, I’d make an end of it ... I’d throw myself over.”\\n\\n“Good Lord!—and then?” cried Victoire.\\n\\n“Then I had a revulsion of feeling. At any rate, I’d stick it out to\\nthe end. I gave myself another minute... one more minute—the last, and\\nI had my revolver on me... but during that minute I put forth every\\nounce of strength I had left ... I began to gain ground ... I had them\\npretty well strung out already ... they were blown too. The knowledge\\ngave me back my courage, and I plugged on ... my feet did not feel so\\nmuch as though they were made of lead. I began to run away from them\\n... they were dropping behind ... all of them but one ... he stuck to\\nme. We went at a jog-trot, a slow jog-trot, for I don’t know how long.\\nThen we dropped to a walk—we could run no more; and on we went. My\\nstrength and wind began to come back. I suppose my pursuer’s did too;\\nfor exactly what I expected happened. He gave a yell and dashed for me.\\nI was ready for him. I pretended to start running, and when he was\\nwithin three yards of me I dropped on one knee, caught his ankles, and\\nchucked him over my head. I don’t know whether he broke his neck or\\nnot. I hope he did.”\\n\\n“Splendid!” said Victoire. “Splendid!”\\n\\n“Well, there I was, outside Paris, and I’m hanged if I know where. I\\nwent on half a mile, and then I rested. Oh, how sleepy I was! I would\\nhave given a hundred thousand francs for an hour’s sleep—cheerfully.\\nBut I dared not let myself sleep. I had to get back here unseen. There\\nwere you and Sonia.”\\n\\n“Sonia? Another woman?” cried Victoire. “Oh, it’s then that I’m\\nfrightened ... when you get a woman mixed up in your game. Always, when\\nyou come to grief ... when you really get into danger, there’s a woman\\nin it.”\\n\\n“Oh, but she’s charming!” protested Lupin.\\n\\n“They always are,” said Victoire drily. “But go on. Tell me how you got\\nhere.”\\n\\n“Well, I knew it was going to be a tough job, so I took a good rest—an\\nhour, I should think. And then I started to walk back. I found that I\\nhad come a devil of a way—I must have gone at Marathon pace. I walked\\nand walked, and at last I got into Paris, and found myself with still a\\ncouple of miles to go. It was all right now; I should soon find a cab.\\nBut the luck was dead against me. I heard a man come round the corner\\nof a side-street into a long street I was walking down. He gave a yell,\\nand came bucketing after me. It was that hound Dieusy. He had\\nrecognized my figure. Off I went; and the chase began again. I led him\\na dance, but I couldn’t shake him off. All the while I was working my\\nway towards home. Then, just at last, I spurted for all I was worth,\\ngot out of his sight, bolted round the corner of the street into the\\nsecret entrance, and here I am.” He smiled weakly, and added, “Oh, my\\ndear Victoire, what a profession it is!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\nTHE CUTTING OF THE TELEPHONE WIRES\\n\\n\\nThe door opened, and in came Charolais, bearing a tray.\\n\\n“Here’s your breakfast, master,” he said.\\n\\n“Don’t call me master—that’s how his men address Guerchard. It’s a\\ndisgusting practice,” said Lupin severely.\\n\\nVictoire and Charolais were quick laying the table. Charolais kept up a\\nrunning fire of questions as he did it; but Lupin did not trouble to\\nanswer them. He lay back, relaxed, drawing deep breaths. Already his\\nlips had lost their greyness, and were pink; there was a suggestion of\\nblood under the skin of his pale face. They soon had the table laid;\\nand he walked to it on fairly steady feet. He sat down; Charolais\\nwhipped off a cover, and said:\\n\\n“Anyhow, you’ve got out of the mess neatly. It was a jolly smart\\nescape.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes. So far it’s all right,” said Lupin. “But there’s going to be\\ntrouble presently—lots of it. I shall want all my wits. We all shall.”\\n\\nHe fell upon his breakfast with the appetite but not the manners of a\\nwolf. Charolais went out of the room. Victoire hovered about him,\\npouring out his coffee and putting sugar into it.\\n\\n“By Jove, how good these eggs are!” he said. “I think that, of all the\\nthousand ways of cooking eggs, _en cocotte_ is the best.”\\n\\n“Heavens! how empty I was!” he said presently. “What a meal I’m making!\\nIt’s really a very healthy life, this of mine, Victoire. I feel much\\nbetter already.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; it’s all very well to talk,” said Victoire, in a scolding\\ntone; for since he was better, she felt, as a good woman should, that\\nthe time had come to put in a word out of season. “But, all the same,\\nyou’re trying to kill yourself—that’s what you’re doing. Just because\\nyou’re young you abuse your youth. It won’t last for ever; and you’ll\\nbe sorry you used it up before it’s time. And this life of lies and\\nthefts and of all kinds of improper things—I suppose it’s going to\\nbegin all over again. It’s no good your getting a lesson. It’s just\\nthrown away upon you.”\\n\\n“What I want next is a bath,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“It’s all very well your pretending not to listen to me, when you know\\nvery well that I’m speaking for your good,” she went on, raising her\\nvoice a little. “But I tell you that all this is going to end badly. To\\nbe a thief gives you no position in the world—no position at all—and\\nwhen I think of what you made me do the night before last, I’m just\\nhorrified at myself.”\\n\\n“We’d better not talk about that—the mess you made of it! It was\\npositively excruciating!” said Lupin.\\n\\n“And what did you expect? I’m an honest woman, I am!” said Victoire\\nsharply. “I wasn’t brought up to do things like that, thank goodness!\\nAnd to begin at my time of life!”\\n\\n“It’s true, and I often ask myself how you bring yourself to stick to\\nme,” said Lupin, in a reflective, quite impersonal tone. “Please pour\\nme out another cup of coffee.”\\n\\n“That’s what I’m always asking myself,” said Victoire, pouring out the\\ncoffee. “I don’t know—I give it up. I suppose it is because I’m fond of\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Yes, and I’m very fond of you, my dear Victoire,” said Lupin, in a\\ncoaxing tone.\\n\\n“And then, look you, there are things that there’s no understanding. I\\noften talked to your poor mother about them. Oh, your poor mother!\\nWhatever would she have said to these goings-on?”\\n\\nLupin helped himself to another cutlet; his eyes twinkled and he said,\\n“I’m not sure that she would have been very much surprised. I always\\ntold her that I was going to punish society for the way it had treated\\nher. Do you think she would have been surprised?”\\n\\n“Oh, nothing you did would have surprised her,” said Victoire. “When\\nyou were quite a little boy you were always making us wonder. You gave\\nyourself such airs, and you had such nice manners of your\\nown—altogether different from the other boys. And you were already a\\nbad boy, when you were only seven years old, full of all kinds of\\ntricks; and already you had begun to steal.”\\n\\n“Oh, only sugar,” protested Lupin.\\n\\n“Yes, you began by stealing sugar,” said Victoire, in the severe tones\\nof a moralist. “And then it was jam, and then it was pennies. Oh, it\\nwas all very well at that age—a little thief is pretty enough. But\\nnow—when you’re twenty-eight years old.”\\n\\n“Really, Victoire, you’re absolutely depressing,” said Lupin, yawning;\\nand he helped himself to jam.\\n\\n“I know very well that you’re all right at heart,” said Victoire. “Of\\ncourse you only rob the rich, and you’ve always been kind to the\\npoor.... Yes; there’s no doubt about it: you have a good heart.”\\n\\n“I can’t help it—what about it?” said Lupin, smiling.\\n\\n“Well, you ought to have different ideas in your head. Why are you a\\nburglar?”\\n\\n“You ought to try it yourself, my dear Victoire,” said Lupin gently;\\nand he watched her with a humorous eye.\\n\\n“Goodness, what a thing to say!” cried Victoire.\\n\\n“I assure you, you ought,” said Lupin, in a tone of thoughtful\\nconviction. “I’ve tried everything. I’ve taken my degree in medicine\\nand in law. I have been an actor, and a professor of Jiu-jitsu. I have\\neven been a member of the detective force, like that wretched\\nGuerchard. Oh, what a dirty world that is! Then I launched out into\\nsociety. I have been a duke. Well, I give you my word that not one of\\nthese professions equals that of burglar—not even the profession of\\nDuke. There is so much of the unexpected in it, Victoire—the splendid\\nunexpected.... And then, it’s full of variety, so terrible, so\\nfascinating.” His voice sank a little, and he added, “And what fun it\\nis!”\\n\\n“Fun!” cried Victoire.\\n\\n“Yes ... these rich men, these swells in their luxury—when one relieves\\nthem of a bank-note, how they do howl! ... You should have seen that\\nfat old Gournay-Martin when I relieved him of his treasures—what an\\nagony! You almost heard the death-rattle in his throat. And then the\\ncoronet! In the derangement of their minds—and it was sheer\\nderangement, mind you—already prepared at Charmerace, in the\\nderangement of Guerchard, I had only to put out my hand and pluck the\\ncoronet. And the joy, the ineffable joy of enraging the police! To see\\nGuerchard’s furious eyes when I downed him.... And look round you!” He\\nwaved his hand round the luxurious room. “Duke of Charmerace! This\\ntrade leads to everything ... to everything on condition that one\\nsticks to it ....I tell you, Victoire, that when one cannot be a great\\nartist or a great soldier, the only thing to be is a great thief!”\\n\\n“Oh, be quiet!” cried Victoire. “Don’t talk like that. You’re working\\nyourself up; you’re intoxicating yourself! And all that, it is not\\nCatholic. Come, at your age, you ought to have one idea in your head\\nwhich should drive out all these others, which should make you forget\\nall these thefts.... Love ... that would change you, I’m sure of it.\\nThat would make another man of you. You ought to marry.”\\n\\n“Yes ... perhaps ... that would make another man of me. That’s what\\nI’ve been thinking. I believe you’re right,” said Lupin thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Is that true? Have you really been thinking of it?” cried Victoire\\njoyfully.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Lupin, smiling at her eagerness. “I have been thinking\\nabout it—seriously.”\\n\\n“No more messing about—no more intrigues. But a real woman ... a woman\\nfor life?” cried Victoire.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Lupin softly; and his eyes were shining in a very grave\\nface.\\n\\n“Is it serious—is it real love, dearie?” said Victoire. “What’s she\\nlike?”\\n\\n“She’s beautiful,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Oh, trust you for that. Is she a blonde or a brunette?”\\n\\n“She’s very fair and delicate—like a princess in a fairy tale,” said\\nLupin softly.\\n\\n“What is she? What does she do?” said Victoire.\\n\\n“Well, since you ask me, she’s a thief,” said Lupin with a mischievous\\nsmile.\\n\\n“Good Heavens!” cried Victoire.\\n\\n“But she’s a very charming thief,” said Lupin; and he rose smiling.\\n\\nHe lighted a cigar, stretched himself and yawned: “She had ever so much\\nmore reason for stealing than ever I had,” he said. “And she has always\\nhated it like poison.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s something,” said Victoire; and her blank and fallen face\\nbrightened a little.\\n\\nLupin walked up and down the room, breathing out long luxurious puffs\\nof smoke from his excellent cigar, and watching Victoire with a\\nhumorous eye. He walked across to his book-shelf, and scanned the\\ntitles of his books with an appreciative, almost affectionate smile.\\n\\n“This is a very pleasant interlude,” he said languidly. “But I don’t\\nsuppose it’s going to last very long. As soon as Guerchard recovers\\nfrom the shock of learning that I spent a quiet night in my ducal bed\\nas an honest duke should, he’ll be getting to work with positively\\nfurious energy, confound him! I could do with a whole day’s\\nsleep—twenty-four solid hours of it.”\\n\\n“I’m sure you could, dearie,” said Victoire sympathetically.\\n\\n“The girl I’m going to marry is Sonia Kritchnoff,” he said.\\n\\n“Sonia? That dear child! But I love her already!” cried Victoire.\\n“Sonia, but why did you say she was a thief? That was a silly thing to\\nsay.”\\n\\n“It’s my extraordinary sense of humour,” said Lupin.\\n\\nThe door opened and Charolais bustled in: “Shall I clear away the\\nbreakfast?” he said.\\n\\nLupin nodded; and then the telephone bell rang. He put his finger on\\nhis lips and went to it.\\n\\n“Are you there?” he said. “Oh, it’s you, Germaine.... Good morning....\\nOh, yes, I had a good night—excellent, thank you.... You want to speak\\nto me presently? ... You’re waiting for me at the Ritz?”\\n\\n“Don’t go—don’t go—it isn’t safe,” said Victoire, in a whisper.\\n\\n“All right, I’ll be with you in about half an hour, or perhaps\\nthree-quarters. I’m not dressed yet ... but I’m ever so much more\\nimpatient than you ... good-bye for the present.” He put the receiver\\non the stand.\\n\\n“It’s a trap,” said Charolais.\\n\\n“Never mind, what if it is? Is it so very serious?” said Lupin.\\n“There’ll be nothing but traps now; and if I can find the time I shall\\ncertainly go and take a look at that one.”\\n\\n“And if she knows everything? If she’s taking her revenge ... if she’s\\ngetting you there to have you arrested?” said Victoire.\\n\\n“Yes, M. Formery is probably at the Ritz with Gournay-Martin. They’re\\nprobably all of them there, weighing the coronet,” said Lupin, with a\\nchuckle.\\n\\nHe hesitated a moment, reflecting; then he said, “How silly you are! If\\nthey wanted to arrest me, if they had the material proof which they\\nhaven’t got, Guerchard would be here already!”\\n\\n“Then why did they chase you last night?” said Charolais.\\n\\n“The coronet,” said Lupin. “Wasn’t that reason enough? But, as it\\nturned out, they didn’t catch me: and when the detectives did come\\nhere, they disturbed me in my sleep. And that me was ever so much more\\nme than the man they followed. And then the proofs ... they must have\\nproofs. There aren’t any—or rather, what there are, I’ve got!” He\\npointed to a small safe let into the wall. “In that safe are the\\ncoronet, and, above all, the death certificate of the Duke of\\nCharmerace ... everything that Guerchard must have to induce M. Formery\\nto proceed. But still, there is a risk—I think I’d better have those\\nthings handy in case I have to bolt.”\\n\\nHe went into his bedroom and came back with the key of the safe and a\\nkit-bag. He opened the safe and took out the coronet, the real coronet\\nof the Princesse de Lamballe, and along with it a pocket-book with a\\nfew papers in it. He set the pocket-book on the table, ready to put in\\nhis coat-pocket when he should have dressed, and dropped the coronet\\ninto the kit-bag.\\n\\n“I’m glad I have that death certificate; it makes it much safer,” he\\nsaid. “If ever they do nab me, I don’t wish that rascal Guerchard to\\naccuse me of having murdered the Duke. It might prejudice me badly.\\nI’ve not murdered anybody yet.”\\n\\n“That comes of having a good heart,” said Victoire proudly.\\n\\n“Not even the Duke of Charmerace,” said Charolais sadly. “And it would\\nhave been so easy when he was ill—just one little draught. And he was\\nin such a perfect place—so out of the way—no doctors.”\\n\\n“You do have such disgusting ideas, Charolais,” said Lupin, in a tone\\nof severe reproof.\\n\\n“Instead of which you went and saved his life,” said Charolais, in a\\ntone of deep discontent; and he went on clearing the table.\\n\\n“I did, I did: I had grown quite fond of him,” said Lupin, with a\\nmeditative air. “For one thing, he was so very like one. I’m not sure\\nthat he wasn’t even better-looking.”\\n\\n“No; he was just like you,” said Victoire, with decision. “Any one\\nwould have said you were twin brothers.”\\n\\n“It gave me quite a shock the first time I saw his portrait,” said\\nLupin. “You remember, Charolais? It was three years ago, the day, or\\nrather the night, of the first Gournay-Martin burglary at Charmerace.\\nDo you remember?”\\n\\n“Do I remember?” said Charolais. “It was I who pointed out the likeness\\nto you. I said, ‘He’s the very spit of you, master.’ And you said,\\n‘There’s something to be done with that, Charolais.’ And then off you\\nstarted for the ice and snow and found the Duke, and became his friend;\\nand then he went and died, not that you’d have helped him to, if he\\nhadn’t.”\\n\\n“Poor Charmerace. He was indeed grand seigneur. With him a great name\\nwas about to be extinguished.... Did I hesitate? ... No.... I continued\\nit,” said Lupin.\\n\\nHe paused and looked at the clock. “A quarter to eight,” he said,\\nhesitating. “Shall I telephone to Sonia, or shall I not? Oh, there’s no\\nhurry; let the poor child sleep on. She must be worn out after that\\nnight-journey and that cursed Guerchard’s persecution yesterday. I’ll\\ndress first, and telephone to her afterwards. I’d better be getting\\ndressed, by the way. The work I’ve got to do can’t be done in pyjamas.\\nI wish it could; for bed’s the place for me. My wits aren’t quite as\\nclear as I could wish them to deal with an awkward business like this.\\nWell, I must do the best I can with them.”\\n\\nHe yawned and went to the bedroom, leaving the pocket-book on the\\ntable.\\n\\n“Bring my shaving-water, Charolais, and shave me,” he said, pausing;\\nand he went into the bedroom and shut the door.\\n\\n“Ah,” said Victoire sadly, “what a pity it is! A few years ago he would\\nhave gone to the Crusades; and to-day he steals coronets. What a pity\\nit is!”\\n\\n“I think myself that the best thing we can do is to pack up our\\nbelongings,” said Charolais. “And I don’t think we’ve much time to do\\nit either. This particular game is at an end, you may take it from me.”\\n\\n“I hope to goodness it is: I want to get back to the country,” said\\nVictoire.\\n\\nHe took up the tray; and they went out of the room. On the landing they\\nseparated; she went upstairs and he went down. Presently he came up\\nwith the shaving water and shaved his master; for in the house in\\nUniversity Street he discharged the double functions of valet and\\nbutler. He had just finished his task when there came a ring at the\\nfront-door bell.\\n\\n“You’d better go and see who it is,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Bernard is answering the door,” said Charolais. “But perhaps I’d\\nbetter keep an eye on it myself; one never knows.”\\n\\nHe put away the razor leisurely, and went. On the stairs he found\\nBonavent, mounting—Bonavent, disguised in the livery and fierce\\nmoustache of a porter from the Ritz.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you come to the servants’ entrance?” said Charolais, with\\nthe truculent air of the servant of a duke and a stickler for his\\nmaster’s dignity.\\n\\n“I didn’t know that there was one,” said Bonavent humbly. “Well, you\\nought to have known that there was; and it’s plain enough to see. What\\nis it you want?” said Charolais.\\n\\n“I’ve brought a letter—a letter for the Duke of Charmerace,” said\\nBonavent.\\n\\n“Give it to me,” said Charolais. “I’ll take it to him.”\\n\\n“No, no; I’m to give it into the hands of the Duke himself and to\\nnobody else,” said Bonavent.\\n\\n“Well, in that case, you’ll have to wait till he’s finished dressing,”\\nsaid Charolais.\\n\\nThey went on up to the stairs into the ante-room. Bonavent was walking\\nstraight into the smoking-room.\\n\\n“Here! where are you going to? Wait here,” said Charolais quickly.\\n“Take a chair; sit down.”\\n\\nBonavent sat down with a very stolid air, and Charolais looked at him\\ndoubtfully, in two minds whether to leave him there alone or not.\\nBefore he had decided there came a thundering knock on the front door,\\nnot only loud but protracted. Charolais looked round with a scared air;\\nand then ran out of the room and down the stairs.\\n\\nOn the instant Bonavent was on his feet, and very far from stolid. He\\nopened the door of the smoking-room very gently and peered in. It was\\nempty. He slipped noiselessly across the room, a pair of clippers ready\\nin his hand, and cut the wires of the telephone. His quick eye glanced\\nround the room and fell on the pocket-book on the table. He snatched it\\nup, and slipped it into the breast of his tunic. He had scarcely done\\nit—one button of his tunic was still to fasten—when the bedroom door\\nopened, and Lupin came out:\\n\\n“What do you want?” he said sharply; and his keen eyes scanned the\\nporter with a disquieting penetration.\\n\\n“I’ve brought a letter to the Duke of Charmerace, to be given into his\\nown hands,” said Bonavent, in a disguised voice.\\n\\n“Give it to me,” said Lupin, holding out his hand.\\n\\n“But the Duke?” said Bonavent, hesitating.\\n\\n“I am the Duke,” said Lupin.\\n\\nBonavent gave him the letter, and turned to go.\\n\\n“Don’t go,” said Lupin quietly. “Wait, there may be an answer.”\\n\\nThere was a faint glitter in his eyes; but Bonavent missed it.\\n\\nCharolais came into the room, and said, in a grumbling tone, “A\\nrun-away knock. I wish I could catch the brats; I’d warm them. They\\nwouldn’t go fetching me away from my work again, in a hurry, I can tell\\nyou.”\\n\\nLupin opened the letter, and read it. As he read it, at first he\\nfrowned; then he smiled; and then he laughed joyously. It ran:\\n\\n“SIR,”\\n\\n\\n“M. Guerchard has told me everything. With regard to Sonia I have\\njudged you: a man who loves a thief can be nothing but a rogue. I have\\ntwo pieces of news to announce to you: the death of the Duke of\\nCharmerace, who died three years ago, and my intention of becoming\\nengaged to his cousin and heir, M. de Relzières, who will assume the\\ntitle and the arms.”\\n\\n\\n“For Mademoiselle Gournay-Martin,”\\n“Her maid, IRMA.”\\n\\n\\n“She does write in shocking bad taste,” said Lupin, shaking his head\\nsadly. “Charolais, sit down and write a letter for me.”\\n\\n“Me?” said Charolais.\\n\\n“Yes; you. It seems to be the fashion in financial circles; and I am\\nbound to follow it when a lady sets it. Write me a letter,” said Lupin.\\n\\nCharolais went to the writing-table reluctantly, sat down, set a sheet\\nof paper on the blotter, took a pen in his hand, and sighed painfully.\\n\\n“Ready?” said Lupin; and he dictated:\\n\\n“MADEMOISELLE,”\\n\\n\\n“I have a very robust constitution, and my indisposition will very soon\\nbe over. I shall have the honour of sending, this afternoon, my humble\\nwedding present to the future Madame de Relzières.”\\n\\n\\n“For Jacques de Bartut, Marquis de Relzières, Prince of Virieux, Duke\\nof Charmerace.”\\n\\n\\n“His butler, ARSÈNE.”\\n\\n\\n“Shall I write Arsène?” said Charolais, in a horrified tone.\\n\\n“Why not?” said Lupin. “It’s your charming name, isn’t it?”\\n\\nBonavent pricked up his ears, and looked at Charolais with a new\\ninterest.\\n\\nCharolais shrugged his shoulders, finished the letter, blotted it, put\\nit in an envelope, addressed it, and handed it to Lupin.\\n\\n“Take this to Mademoiselle Gournay-Martin,” said Lupin, handing it to\\nBonavent.\\n\\nBonavent took the letter, turned, and had taken one step towards the\\ndoor when Lupin sprang. His arm went round the detective’s neck; he\\njerked him backwards off his feet, scragging him.\\n\\n“Stir, and I’ll break your neck!” he cried in a terrible voice; and\\nthen he said quietly to Charolais, “Just take my pocket-book out of\\nthis fellow’s tunic.”\\n\\nCharolais, with deft fingers, ripped open the detective’s tunic, and\\ntook out the pocket-book.\\n\\n“This is what they call Jiu-jitsu, old chap! You’ll be able to teach it\\nto your colleagues,” said Lupin. He loosed his grip on Bonavent, and\\nknocked him straight with a thump in the back, and sent him flying\\nacross the room. Then he took the pocket-book from Charolais and made\\nsure that its contents were untouched.\\n\\n“Tell your master from me that if he wants to bring me down he’d better\\nfire the gun himself,” said Lupin contemptuously. “Show the gentleman\\nout, Charolais.”\\n\\nBonavent staggered to the door, paused, and turned on Lupin a face\\nlivid with fury.\\n\\n“He will be here himself in ten minutes,” he said.\\n\\n“Many thanks for the information,” said Lupin quietly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\nTHE BARGAIN\\n\\n\\nCharolais conducted the detective down the stairs and let him out of\\nthe front door, cursing and threatening vengeance as he went. Charolais\\ntook no notice of his words—he was the well-trained servant. He came\\nback upstairs, and on the landing called to Victoire and Bernard. They\\ncame hurrying down; and the three of them went into the smoking-room.\\n\\n“Now we know where we are,” said Lupin, with cheerful briskness.\\n“Guerchard will be here in ten minutes with a warrant for my arrest.\\nAll of you clear out.”\\n\\n“It won’t be so precious easy. The house is watched,” said Charolais.\\n“And I’ll bet it’s watched back and front.”\\n\\n“Well, slip out by the secret entrance. They haven’t found that yet,”\\nsaid Lupin. “And meet me at the house at Passy.”\\n\\nCharolais and Bernard wanted no more telling; they ran to the book-case\\nand pressed the buttons; the book-case slid aside; the doors opened and\\ndisclosed the lift. They stepped into it. Victoire had followed them.\\nShe paused and said: “And you? Are you coming?”\\n\\n“In an instant I shall slip out the same way,” he said.\\n\\n“I’ll wait for him. You go on,” said Victoire; and the lift went down.\\n\\nLupin went to the telephone, rang the bell, and put the receiver to his\\near.\\n\\n“You’ve no time to waste telephoning. They may be here at any moment!”\\ncried Victoire anxiously.\\n\\n“I must. If I don’t telephone Sonia will come here. She will run right\\ninto Guerchard’s arms. Why the devil don’t they answer? They must be\\ndeaf!” And he rang the bell again.\\n\\n“Let’s go to her! Let’s get out of here!” cried Victoire, more\\nanxiously. “There really isn’t any time to waste.”\\n\\n“Go to her? But I don’t know where she is. I lost my head last night,”\\ncried Lupin, suddenly anxious himself. “Are you there?” he shouted into\\nthe telephone. “She’s at a little hotel near the Star. ... Are you\\nthere? ... But there are twenty hotels near the Star.... Are you there?\\n... Oh, I did lose my head last night. ... Are you there? Oh, hang this\\ntelephone! Here I’m fighting with a piece of furniture. And every\\nsecond is important!”\\n\\nHe picked up the machine, shook it, saw that the wires were cut, and\\ncried furiously: “Ha! They’ve played the telephone trick on me! That’s\\nGuerchard.... The swine!”\\n\\n“And now you can come along!” cried Victoire.\\n\\n“But that’s just what I can’t do!” he cried.\\n\\n“But there’s nothing more for you to do here, since you can no longer\\ntelephone,” said Victoire, bewildered.\\n\\nLupin caught her arm and shook her, staring into her face with\\npanic-stricken eyes. “But don’t you understand that, since I haven’t\\ntelephoned, she’ll come here?” he cried hoarsely. “Five-and-twenty\\nminutes past eight! At half-past eight she will start—start to come\\nhere.”\\n\\nHis face had suddenly grown haggard; this new fear had brought back all\\nthe exhaustion of the night; his eyes were panic-stricken.\\n\\n“But what about you?” said Victoire, wringing her hands.\\n\\n“What about her?” said Lupin; and his voice thrilled with anguished\\ndread.\\n\\n“But you’ll gain nothing by destroying both of you—nothing at all.”\\n\\n“I prefer it,” said Lupin slowly, with a suddenly stubborn air.\\n\\n“But they’re coming to take you,” cried Victoire, gripping his arm.\\n\\n“Take me?” cried Lupin, freeing himself quietly from her grip. And he\\nstood frowning, plunged in deep thought, weighing the chances, the\\nrisks, seeking a plan, saving devices.\\n\\nHe crossed the room to the writing-table, opened a drawer, and took out\\na cardboard box about eight inches square and set it on the table.\\n\\n“They shall never take me alive,” he said gloomily.\\n\\n“Oh, hush, hush!” said Victoire. “I know very well that you’re capable\\nof anything ... and they too—they’ll destroy you. No, look you, you\\nmust go. They won’t do anything to her—a child like that—so frail.\\nShe’ll get off quite easily. You’re coming, aren’t you?”\\n\\n“No, I’m not,” said Lupin stubbornly.\\n\\n“Oh, well, if you won’t,” said Victoire; and with an air of resolution\\nshe went to the side of the lift-well, and pressed the buttons. The\\ndoors closed; the book-case slid across. She sat down and folded her\\narms.\\n\\n“What, you’re not going to stop here?” cried Lupin.\\n\\n“Make me stir if you can. I’m as fond of you as she is—you know I am,”\\nsaid Victoire, and her face set stonily obstinate.\\n\\nLupin begged her to go; ordered her to go; he seized her by the\\nshoulder, shook her, and abused her like a pickpocket. She would not\\nstir. He abandoned the effort, sat down, and knitted his brow again in\\nprofound and painful thought, working out his plan. Now and again his\\neyes flashed, once or twice they twinkled. Victoire watched his face\\nwith just the faintest hope on her own.\\n\\nIt was past five-and-twenty minutes to nine when the front-door bell\\nrang. They gazed at one another with an unspoken question on their\\nlips. The eyes of Victoire were scared, but in the eyes of Lupin the\\nlight of battle was gathering.\\n\\n“It’s her,” said Victoire under her breath.\\n\\n“No,” said Lupin. “It’s Guerchard.”\\n\\nHe sprang to his feet with shining eyes. His lips were curved in a\\nfighting smile. “The game isn’t lost yet,” he said in a tense, quiet\\nvoice. “I’m going to play it to the end. I’ve a card or two left\\nstill—good cards. I’m still the Duke of Charmerace.” He turned to her.\\n\\n“Now listen to me,” he said. “Go down and open the door for him.”\\n\\n“What, you want me to?” said Victoire, in a shaky voice.\\n\\n“Yes, I do. Listen to me carefully. When you have opened the door, slip\\nout of it and watch the house. Don’t go too far from it. Look out for\\nSonia. You’ll see her coming. Stop her from entering, Victoire—stop her\\nfrom entering.” He spoke coolly, but his voice shook on the last words.\\n\\n“But if Guerchard arrests me?” said Victoire.\\n\\n“He won’t. When he comes in, stand behind the door. He will be too\\neager to get to me to stop for you. Besides, for him you don’t count in\\nthe game. Once you’re out of the house, I’ll hold him here for—for half\\nan hour. That will leave a margin. Sonia will hurry here. She should be\\nhere in twelve minutes. Get her away to the house at Passy. If I don’t\\ncome keep her there; she’s to live with you. But I shall come.”\\n\\nAs he spoke he was pushing her towards the door.\\n\\nThe bell rang again. They were at the top of the stairs.\\n\\n“And suppose he does arrest me?” said Victoire breathlessly.\\n\\n“Never mind, you must go all the same,” said Lupin. “Don’t give up\\nhope—trust to me. Go—go—for my sake.”\\n\\n“I’m going, dearie,” said Victoire; and she went down the stairs\\nsteadily, with a brave air.\\n\\nHe watched her half-way down the flight; then he muttered:\\n\\n“If only she gets to Sonia in time.”\\n\\nHe turned, went into the smoking-room, and shut the door. He sat\\nquietly down in an easy chair, lighted a cigarette, and took up a\\npaper. He heard the noise of the traffic in the street grow louder as\\nthe front door was opened. There was a pause; then he heard the door\\nbang. There was the sound of a hasty footstep on the stairs; the door\\nflew open, and Guerchard bounced into the room.\\n\\nHe stopped short in front of the door at the sight of Lupin, quietly\\nreading, smoking at his ease. He had expected to find the bird flown.\\nHe stood still, hesitating, shuffling his feet—all his doubts had\\nreturned; and Lupin smiled at him over the lowered paper.\\n\\nGuerchard pulled himself together by a violent effort, and said\\njerkily, “Good-morning, Lupin.”\\n\\n“Good-morning, M. Guerchard,” said Lupin, with an ambiguous smile and\\nall the air of the Duke of Charmerace.\\n\\n“You were expecting me? ... I hope I haven’t kept you waiting,” said\\nGuerchard, with an air of bravado.\\n\\n“No, thank you: the time has passed quite quickly. I have so much to do\\nin the morning always,” said Lupin. “I hope you had a good night after\\nthat unfortunate business of the coronet. That was a disaster; and so\\nunexpected too.”\\n\\nGuerchard came a few steps into the room, still hesitating:\\n\\n“You’ve a very charming house here,” he said, with a sneer.\\n\\n“It’s central,” said Lupin carelessly. “You must please excuse me, if I\\ncannot receive you as I should like; but all my servants have bolted.\\nThose confounded detectives of yours have frightened them away.”\\n\\n“You needn’t bother about that. I shall catch them,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“If you do, I’m sure I wish you joy of them. Do, please, keep your hat\\non,” said Lupin with ironic politeness.\\n\\nGuerchard came slowly to the middle of the room, raising his hand to\\nhis hat, letting it fall again without taking it off. He sat down\\nslowly facing him, and they gazed at one another with the wary eyes of\\nduellists crossing swords at the beginning of a duel.\\n\\n“Did you get M. Formery to sign a little warrant?” said Lupin, in a\\ncaressing tone full of quiet mockery.\\n\\n“I did,” said Guerchard through his teeth.\\n\\n“And have you got it on you?” said Lupin.\\n\\n“I have,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Against Lupin, or against the Duke of Charmerace?” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Against Lupin, called Charmerace,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Well, that ought to cover me pretty well. Why don’t you arrest me?\\nWhat are you waiting for?” said Lupin. His face was entirely serene,\\nhis eyes were careless, his tone indifferent.\\n\\n“I’m not waiting for anything,” said Guerchard thickly; “but it gives\\nme such pleasure that I wish to enjoy this minute to the utmost,\\nLupin,” said Guerchard; and his eyes gloated on him.\\n\\n“Lupin, himself,” said Lupin, smiling.\\n\\n“I hardly dare believe it,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“You’re quite right not to,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Yes, I hardly dare believe it. You alive, here at my mercy?”\\n\\n“Oh, dear no, not yet,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard, in a decisive tone. “And ever so much more than\\nyou think.” He bent forwards towards him, with his hands on his knees,\\nand said, “Do you know where Sonia Kritchnoff is at this moment?”\\n\\n“What?” said Lupin sharply.\\n\\n“I ask if you know where Sonia Kritchnoff is?” said Guerchard slowly,\\nlingering over the words.\\n\\n“Do you?” said Lupin.\\n\\n“I do,” said Guerchard triumphantly.\\n\\n“Where is she?” said Lupin, in a tone of utter incredulity.\\n\\n“In a small hotel near the Star. The hotel has a telephone; and you can\\nmake sure,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Indeed? That’s very interesting. What’s the number of it?” said Lupin,\\nin a mocking tone.\\n\\n“555 Central: would you like to telephone to her?” said Guerchard; and\\nhe smiled triumphantly at the disabled instrument.\\n\\nLupin shock his head with a careless smile, and said, “Why should I\\ntelephone to her? What are you driving at?”\\n\\n“Nothing ... that’s all,” said Guerchard. And he leant back in his\\nchair with an ugly smile on his face.\\n\\n“Evidently nothing. For, after all, what has that child got to do with\\nyou? You’re not interested in her, plainly. She’s not big enough game\\nfor you. It’s me you are hunting ... it’s me you hate ... it’s me you\\nwant. I’ve played you tricks enough for that, you old scoundrel. So\\nyou’re going to leave that child in peace? ... You’re not going to\\nrevenge yourself on her? ... It’s all very well for you to be a\\npoliceman; it’s all very well for you to hate me; but there are things\\none does not do.” There was a ring of menace and appeal in the deep,\\nringing tones of his voice. “You’re not going to do that, Guerchard....\\nYou will not do it.... Me—yes—anything you like. But her—her you must\\nnot touch.” He gazed at the detective with fierce, appealing eyes.\\n\\n“That depends on you,” said Guerchard curtly.\\n\\n“On me?” cried Lupin, in genuine surprise.\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve a little bargain to propose to you,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Have you?” said Lupin; and his watchful face was serene again, his\\nsmile almost pleasant.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard. And he paused, hesitating.\\n\\n“Well, what is it you want?” said Lupin. “Out with it! Don’t be shy\\nabout it.”\\n\\n“I offer you—”\\n\\n“You offer me?” cried Lupin. “Then it isn’t true. You’re fooling me.”\\n\\n“Reassure yourself,” said Guerchard coldly. “To you personally I offer\\nnothing.”\\n\\n“Then you are sincere,” said Lupin. “And putting me out of the\\nquestion?”\\n\\n“I offer you liberty.”\\n\\n“Who for? For my concierge?” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Don’t play the fool. You care only for a single person in the world. I\\nhold you through her: Sonia Kritchnoff.”\\n\\nLupin burst into a ringing, irrepressible laugh:\\n\\n“Why, you’re trying to blackmail me, you old sweep!” he cried.\\n\\n“If you like to call it so,” said Guerchard coldly.\\n\\nLupin rose and walked backwards and forwards across the room, frowning,\\ncalculating, glancing keenly at Guerchard, weighing him. Twice he\\nlooked at the clock.\\n\\nHe stopped and said coldly: “So be it. For the moment you’re the\\nstronger.... That won’t last.... But you offer me this child’s\\nliberty.”\\n\\n“That’s my offer,” said Guerchard; and his eyes brightened at the\\nprospect of success.\\n\\n“Her complete liberty? ... on your word of honour?” said Lupin; and he\\nhad something of the air of a cat playing with a mouse.\\n\\n“On my word of honour,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Can you do it?” said Lupin, with a sudden air of doubt; and he looked\\nsharply from Guerchard to the clock.\\n\\n“I undertake to do it,” said Guerchard confidently.\\n\\n“But how?” said Lupin, looking at him with an expression of the gravest\\ndoubt.\\n\\n“Oh, I’ll put the thefts on your shoulders. That will let her out all\\nright,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“I’ve certainly good broad shoulders,” said Lupin, with a bitter smile.\\nHe walked slowly up and down with an air that grew more and more\\ndepressed: it was almost the air of a beaten man. Then he stopped and\\nfaced Guerchard, and said: “And what is it you want in exchange?”\\n\\n“Everything,” said Guerchard, with the air of a man who is winning.\\n“You must give me back the pictures, tapestry, Renaissance cabinets,\\nthe coronet, and all the information about the death of the Duke of\\nCharmerace. Did you kill him?”\\n\\n“If ever I commit suicide, you’ll know all about it, my good Guerchard.\\nYou’ll be there. You may even join me,” said Lupin grimly; he resumed\\nhis pacing up and down the room.\\n\\n“Done for, yes; I shall be done for,” he said presently. “The fact is,\\nyou want my skin.”\\n\\n“Yes, I want your skin,” said Guerchard, in a low, savage, vindictive\\ntone.\\n\\n“My skin,” said Lupin thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Are you going to do it? Think of that girl,” said Guerchard, in a\\nfresh access of uneasy anxiety.\\n\\nLupin laughed: “I can give you a glass of port,” he said, “but I’m\\nafraid that’s all I can do for you.”\\n\\n“I’ll throw Victoire in,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“What?” cried Lupin. “You’ve arrested Victoire?” There was a ring of\\nutter dismay, almost despair, in his tone.\\n\\n“Yes; and I’ll throw her in. She shall go scot-free. I won’t bother\\nwith her,” said Guerchard eagerly.\\n\\nThe front-door bell rang.\\n\\n“Wait, wait. Let me think,” said Lupin hoarsely; and he strove to\\nadjust his jostling ideas, to meet with a fresh plan this fresh\\ndisaster.\\n\\nHe stood listening with all his ears. There were footsteps on the\\nstairs, and the door opened. Dieusy stood on the threshold.\\n\\n“Who is it?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“I accept—I accept everything,” cried Lupin in a frantic tone.\\n\\n“It’s a tradesman; am I to detain him?” said Dieusy. “You told me to\\nlet you know who came and take instructions.”\\n\\n“A tradesman? Then I refuse!” cried Lupin, in an ecstasy of relief.\\n\\n“No, you needn’t keep him,” said Guerchard, to Dieusy.\\n\\nDieusy went out and shut the door.\\n\\n“You refuse?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“I refuse,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“I’m going to gaol that girl,” said Guerchard savagely; and he took a\\nstep towards the door.\\n\\n“Not for long,” said Lupin quietly. “You have no proof.”\\n\\n“She’ll furnish the proof all right herself—plenty of proofs,” said\\nGuerchard brutally. “What chance has a silly child like that got, when\\nwe really start questioning her? A delicate creature like that will\\ncrumple up before the end of the third day’s cross-examination.”\\n\\n“You swine!” said Lupin. “You know well enough that I can do it—on my\\nhead—with a feeble child like that; and you know your Code; five years\\nis the minimum,” said Guerchard, in a tone of relentless brutality,\\nwatching him carefully, sticking to his hope.\\n\\n“By Jove, I could wring your neck!” said Lupin, trembling with fury. By\\na violent effort he controlled himself, and said thoughtfully, “After\\nall, if I give up everything to you, I shall be free to take it back\\none of these days.”\\n\\n“Oh, no doubt, when you come out of prison,” said Guerchard ironically;\\nand he laughed a grim, jeering laugh.\\n\\n“I’ve got to go to prison first,” said Lupin quietly.\\n\\n“Pardon me—if you accept, I mean to arrest you,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Manifestly you’ll arrest me if you can,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Do you accept?” said Guerchard. And again his voice quivered with\\nanxiety.\\n\\n“Well,” said Lupin. And he paused as if finally weighing the matter.\\n\\n“Well?” said Guerchard, and his voice shook.\\n\\n“Well—no!” said Lupin; and he laughed a mocking laugh.\\n\\n“You won’t?” said Guerchard between his teeth.\\n\\n“No; you wish to catch me. This is just a ruse,” said Lupin, in quiet,\\nmeasured tones. “At bottom you don’t care a hang about Sonia,\\nMademoiselle Kritchnoff. You will not arrest her. And then, if you did\\nyou have no proofs. There ARE no proofs. As for the pendant, you’d have\\nto prove it. You can’t prove it. You can’t prove that it was in her\\npossession one moment. Where is the pendant?” He paused, and then went\\non in the same quiet tone: “No, Guerchard; after having kept out of\\nyour clutches for the last ten years, I’m not going to be caught to\\nsave this child, who is not even in danger. She has a very useful\\nfriend in the Duke of Charmerace. I refuse.”\\n\\nGuerchard stared at him, scowling, biting his lips, seeking a fresh\\npoint of attack. For the moment he knew himself baffled, but he still\\nclung tenaciously to the struggle in which victory would be so\\nprecious.\\n\\nThe front-door bell rang again.\\n\\n“There’s a lot of ringing at your bell this morning,” said Guerchard,\\nunder his breath; and hope sprang afresh in him.\\n\\nAgain they stood silent, waiting.\\n\\nDieusy opened the door, put in his head, and said, “It’s Mademoiselle\\nKritchnoff.”\\n\\n“Collar her! ... Here’s the warrant! ... collar her!” shouted\\nGuerchard, with savage, triumphant joy.\\n\\n“Never! You shan’t touch her! By Heaven, you shan’t touch her!” cried\\nLupin frantically; and he sprang like a tiger at Guerchard.\\n\\nGuerchard jumped to the other side of the table. “Will you accept,\\nthen?” he cried.\\n\\nLupin gripped the edge of the table with both hands, and stood panting,\\ngrinding his teeth, pale with fury. He stood silent and motionless for\\nperhaps half a minute, gazing at Guerchard with burning, murderous\\neyes. Then he nodded his head.\\n\\n“Let Mademoiselle Kritchnoff wait,” said Guerchard, with a sigh of deep\\nrelief. Dieusy went out of the room.\\n\\n“Now let us settle exactly how we stand,” said Lupin, in a clear,\\nincisive voice. “The bargain is this: If I give you the pictures, the\\ntapestry, the cabinets, the coronet, and the death-certificate of the\\nDuke of Charmerace, you give me your word of honour that Mademoiselle\\nKritchnoff shall not be touched.”\\n\\n“That’s it!” said Guerchard eagerly.\\n\\n“Once I deliver these things to you, Mademoiselle Kritchnoff passes out\\nof the game.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Whatever happens afterwards. If I get back anything—if I escape—she\\ngoes scot-free,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Guerchard; and his eyes were shining.\\n\\n“On your word of honour?” said Lupin.\\n\\n“On my word of honour,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Very well,” said Lupin, in a quiet, businesslike voice. “To begin\\nwith, here in this pocket-book you’ll find all the documents relating\\nto the death of the Duke of Charmerace. In it you will also find the\\nreceipt of the Plantin furniture repository at Batignolles for the\\nobjects of art which I collected at Gournay-Martin’s. I sent them to\\nBatignolles because, in my letters asking the owners of valuables to\\nforward them to me, I always make Batignolles the place to which they\\nare to be sent; therefore I knew that you would never look there. They\\nare all in cases; for, while you were making those valuable inquiries\\nyesterday, my men were putting them into cases. You’ll not find the\\nreceipt in the name of either the Duke of Charmerace or my own. It is\\nin the name of a respected proprietor of Batignolles, a M. Pierre\\nServien. But he has lately left that charming suburb, and I do not\\nthink he will return to it.”\\n\\nGuerchard almost snatched the pocket-book out of his hand. He verified\\nthe documents in it with greedy eyes; and then he put them back in it,\\nand stuffed it into the breast-pocket of his coat.\\n\\n“And where’s the coronet?” he said, in an excited voice.\\n\\n“You’re nearly standing on it,” said Lupin.\\n\\n“It’s in that kit-bag at your feet, on the top of the change of clothes\\nin it.”\\n\\nGuerchard snatched up the kit-bag, opened it, and took out the coronet.\\n\\n“I’m afraid I haven’t the case,” said Lupin, in a tone of regret. “If\\nyou remember, I left it at Gournay-Martin’s—in your charge.”\\n\\nGuerchard examined the coronet carefully. He looked at the stones in\\nit; he weighed it in his right hand, and he weighed it in his left.\\n\\n“Are you sure it’s the real one?” said Lupin, in a tone of acute but\\naffected anxiety. “Do not—oh, do not let us have any more of these\\npainful mistakes about it. They are so wearing.”\\n\\n“Yes—yes—this is the real one,” said Guerchard, with another deep sigh\\nof relief.\\n\\n“Well, have you done bleeding me?” said Lupin contemptuously.\\n\\n“Your arms,” said Guerchard quickly.\\n\\n“They weren’t in the bond,” said Lupin. “But here you are.” And he\\nthrew his revolver on the table.\\n\\nGuerchard picked it up and put it into his pocket. He looked at Lupin\\nas if he could not believe his eyes, gloating over him. Then he said in\\na deep, triumphant tone:\\n\\n“And now for the handcuffs!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\nTHE END OF THE DUEL\\n\\n\\n“The handcuffs?” said Lupin; and his face fell. Then it cleared; and he\\nadded lightly, “After all, there’s nothing like being careful; and, by\\nJove, with me you need to be. I might get away yet. What luck it is for\\nyou that I’m so soft, so little of a Charmerace, so human! Truly, I\\ncan’t be much of a man of the world, to be in love like this!”\\n\\n“Come, come, hold out your hands!” said Guerchard, jingling the\\nhandcuffs impatiently.\\n\\n“I should like to see that child for the last time,” said Lupin gently.\\n\\n“All right,” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin—and nabbed by you! If you aren’t in luck! Here you are!”\\nsaid Lupin bitterly; and he held out his wrists.\\n\\nGuerchard snapped the handcuffs on them with a grunt of satisfaction.\\n\\nLupin gazed down at them with a bitter face, and said: “Oh, you are in\\nluck! You’re not married by any chance?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes; I am,” said Guerchard hastily; and he went quickly to the\\ndoor and opened it: “Dieusy!” he called. “Dieusy! Mademoiselle\\nKritchnoff is at liberty. Tell her so, and bring her in here.”\\n\\nLupin started back, flushed and scowling; he cried: “With these things\\non my hands! ... No! ... I can’t see her!”\\n\\nGuerchard stood still, looking at him. Lupin’s scowl slowly softened,\\nand he said, half to himself, “But I should have liked to see her ...\\nvery much ... for if she goes like that ... I shall not know when or\\nwhere—” He stopped short, raised his eyes, and said in a decided tone:\\n“Ah, well, yes; I should like to see her.”\\n\\n“If you’ve quite made up your mind,” said Guerchard impatiently, and he\\nwent into the anteroom.\\n\\nLupin stood very still, frowning thoughtfully. He heard footsteps on\\nthe stairs, and then the voice of Guerchard in the anteroom, saying, in\\na jeering tone, “You’re free, mademoiselle; and you can thank the Duke\\nfor it. You owe your liberty to him.”\\n\\n“Free! And I owe it to him?” cried the voice of Sonia, ringing and\\ngolden with extravagant joy.\\n\\n“Yes, mademoiselle,” said Guerchard. “You owe it to him.”\\n\\nShe came through the open door, flushed deliciously and smiling, her\\neyes brimming with tears of joy. Lupin had never seen her look half so\\nadorable.\\n\\n“Is it to you I owe it? Then I shall owe everything to you. Oh, thank\\nyou—thank you!” she cried, holding out her hands to him.\\n\\nLupin half turned away from her to hide his handcuffs.\\n\\nShe misunderstood the movement. Her face fell suddenly like that of a\\nchild rebuked: “Oh, I was wrong. I was wrong to come here!” she cried\\nquickly, in changed, dolorous tones. “I thought yesterday ... I made a\\nmistake ... pardon me. I’m going. I’m going.”\\n\\nLupin was looking at her over his shoulder, standing sideways to hide\\nthe handcuffs. He said sadly. “Sonia—”\\n\\n“No, no, I understand! It was impossible!” she cried quickly, cutting\\nhim short. “And yet if you only knew—if you knew how I have\\nchanged—with what a changed spirit I came here.... Ah, I swear that now\\nI hate all my past. I loathe it. I swear that now the mere presence of\\na thief would overwhelm me with disgust.”\\n\\n“Hush!” said Lupin, flushing deeply, and wincing. “Hush!”\\n\\n“But, after all, you’re right,” she said, in a gentler voice. “One\\ncan’t wipe out what one has done. If I were to give back everything\\nI’ve taken—if I were to spend years in remorse and repentance, it would\\nbe no use. In your eyes I should always be Sonia Kritchnoff, the\\nthief!” The great tears welled slowly out of her eyes and rolled down\\nher cheeks; she let them stream unheeded.\\n\\n“Sonia!” cried Lupin, protesting.\\n\\nBut she would not hear him. She broke out with fresh vehemence, a\\nfeverish passion: “And yet, if I’d been a thief, like so many others...\\nbut you know why I stole. I’m not trying to defend myself, but, after\\nall, I did it to keep honest; and when I loved you it was not the heart\\nof a thief that thrilled, it was the heart of a poor girl who\\nloved...that’s all...who loved.”\\n\\n“You don’t know what you’re doing! You’re torturing me! Be quiet!”\\ncried Lupin hoarsely, beside himself.\\n\\n“Never mind...I’m going...we shall never see one another any more,” she\\nsobbed. “But will you...will you shake hands just for the last time?”\\n\\n“No!” cried Lupin.\\n\\n“You won’t?” wailed Sonia in a heartrending tone.\\n\\n“I can’t!” cried Lupin.\\n\\n“You ought not to be like this.... Last night ... if you were going to\\nlet me go like this ... last night ... it was wrong,” she wailed, and\\nturned to go.\\n\\n“Wait, Sonia! Wait!” cried Lupin hoarsely. “A moment ago you said\\nsomething.... You said that the mere presence of a thief would\\noverwhelm you with disgust. Is that true?”\\n\\n“Yes, I swear it is,” cried Sonia.\\n\\nGuerchard appeared in the doorway.\\n\\n“And if I were not the man you believe?” said Lupin sombrely.\\n\\n“What?” said Sonia; and a faint bewilderment mingled with her grief.\\n“If I were not the Duke of Charmerace?”\\n\\n“Not the Duke?”\\n\\n“If I were not an honest man?” said Lupin.\\n\\n“You?” cried Sonia.\\n\\n“If I were a thief? If I were—”\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin,” jeered Guerchard from the door.\\n\\nLupin turned and held out his manacled wrists for her to see.\\n\\n“Arsène Lupin! ... it’s ... it’s true!” stammered Sonia. “But then, but\\nthen ... it must be for my sake that you’ve given yourself up. And it’s\\nfor me you’re going to prison. Oh, Heavens! How happy I am!”\\n\\nShe sprang to him, threw her arms round his neck, and pressed her lips\\nto his.\\n\\n“And that’s what women call repenting,” said Guerchard.\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders, went out on to the landing, and called to\\nthe policeman in the hall to bid the driver of the prison-van, which\\nwas waiting, bring it up to the door.\\n\\n“Oh, this is incredible!” cried Lupin, in a trembling voice; and he\\nkissed Sonia’s lips and eyes and hair. “To think that you love me\\nenough to go on loving me in spite of this—in spite of the fact that\\nI’m Arsène Lupin. Oh, after this, I’ll become an honest man! It’s the\\nleast I can do. I’ll retire.”\\n\\n“You will?” cried Sonia.\\n\\n“Upon my soul, I will!” cried Lupin; and he kissed her again and again.\\n\\nGuerchard came back into the room. He looked at them with a cynical\\ngrin, and said, “Time’s up.”\\n\\n“Oh, Guerchard, after so many others, I owe you the best minute of my\\nlife!” cried Lupin.\\n\\nBonavent, still in his porter’s livery, came hurrying through the\\nanteroom: “Master,” he cried, “I’ve found it.”\\n\\n“Found what?” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“The secret entrance. It opens into that little side street. We haven’t\\ngot the door open yet; but we soon shall.”\\n\\n“The last link in the chain,” said Guerchard, with warm satisfaction.\\n“Come along, Lupin.”\\n\\n“But he’s going to take you away! We’re going to be separated!” cried\\nSonia, in a sudden anguish of realization.\\n\\n“It’s all the same to me now!” cried Lupin, in the voice of a\\nconqueror.\\n\\n“Yes, but not to me!” cried Sonia, wringing her hands.\\n\\n“Now you must keep calm and go. I’m not going to prison,” said Lupin,\\nin a low voice. “Wait in the hall, if you can. Stop and talk to\\nVictoire; condole with her. If they turn you out of the house, wait\\nclose to the front door.”\\n\\n“Come, mademoiselle,” said Guerchard. “You must go.”\\n\\n“Go, Sonia, go—good-bye—good-bye,” said Lupin; and he kissed her.\\n\\nShe went quietly out of the room, her handkerchief to her eyes.\\nGuerchard held open the door for her, and kept it open, with his hand\\nstill on the handle; he said to Lupin: “Come along.”\\n\\nLupin yawned, stretched himself, and said coolly, “My dear Guerchard,\\nwhat I want after the last two nights is rest—rest.” He walked quickly\\nacross the room and stretched himself comfortably at full length on the\\ncouch.\\n\\n“Come, get up,” said Guerchard roughly. “The prison-van is waiting for\\nyou. That ought to fetch you out of your dream.”\\n\\n“Really, you do say the most unlucky things,” said Lupin gaily.\\n\\nHe had resumed his flippant, light-hearted air; his voice rang as\\nlightly and pleasantly as if he had not a care in the world.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you refuse to come?” cried Guerchard in a rough,\\nthreatening tone.\\n\\n“Oh, no,” said Lupin quickly: and he rose.\\n\\n“Then come along!” said Guerchard.\\n\\n“No,” said Lupin, “after all, it’s too early.” Once more he stretched\\nhimself out on the couch, and added languidly, “I’m lunching at the\\nEnglish Embassy.”\\n\\n“Now, you be careful!” cried Guerchard angrily. “Our parts are changed.\\nIf you’re snatching at a last straw, it’s waste of time. All your\\ntricks—I know them. Understand, you rogue, I know them.”\\n\\n“You know them?” said Lupin with a smile, rising. “It’s fatality!”\\n\\nHe stood before Guerchard, twisting his hands and wrists curiously.\\nHalf a dozen swift movements; and he held out his handcuffs in one hand\\nand threw them on the floor.\\n\\n“Did you know that trick, Guerchard? One of these days I shall teach\\nyou to invite me to lunch,” he said slowly, in a mocking tone; and he\\ngazed at the detective with menacing, dangerous eyes.\\n\\n“Come, come, we’ve had enough of this!” cried Guerchard, in mingled\\nastonishment, anger, and alarm. “Bonavent! Boursin! Dieusy! Here! Help!\\nHelp!” he shouted.\\n\\n“Now listen, Guerchard, and understand that I’m not humbugging,” said\\nLupin quickly, in clear, compelling tones. “If Sonia, just now, had had\\none word, one gesture of contempt for me, I’d have given way—yielded\\n... half-yielded, at any rate; for, rather than fall into your\\ntriumphant clutches, I’d have blown my brains out. I’ve now to choose\\nbetween happiness, life with Sonia, or prison. Well, I’ve chosen. I\\nwill live happy with her, or else, my dear Guerchard, I’ll die with\\nyou. Now let your men come—I’m ready for them.”\\n\\nGuerchard ran to the door and shouted again.\\n\\n“I think the fat’s in the fire now,” said Lupin, laughing.\\n\\nHe sprang to the table, opened the cardboard box, whipped off the top\\nlayer of cotton-wool, and took out a shining bomb.\\n\\nHe sprang to the wall, pressed the button, the bookshelf glided slowly\\nto one side, the lift rose to the level of the floor and its doors flew\\nopen just as the detectives rushed in.\\n\\n“Collar him!” yelled Guerchard.\\n\\n“Stand back—hands up!” cried Lupin, in a terrible voice, raising his\\nright hand high above his head. “You know what this is ... a bomb....\\nCome and collar me now, you swine! ... Hands up, you ... Guerchard!”\\n\\n“You silly funks!” roared Guerchard. “Do you think he’d dare?”\\n\\n“Come and see!” cried Lupin.\\n\\n“I will!” cried Guerchard. And he took a step forward.\\n\\nAs one man his detectives threw themselves upon him. Three of them\\ngripped his arms, a fourth gripped him round the waist; and they all\\nshouted at him together, not to be a madman! ... To look at Lupin’s\\neyes! ... That Lupin was off his head!\\n\\n“What miserable swine you are!” cried Lupin scornfully. He sprang\\nforward, caught up the kit-bag in his left hand, and tossed it behind\\nhim into the lift. “You dirty crew!” he cried again. “Oh, why isn’t\\nthere a photographer here? And now, Guerchard, you thief, give me back\\nmy pocket-book.”\\n\\n“Never!” screamed Guerchard, struggling with his men, purple with fury.\\n\\n“Oh, Lord, master! Do be careful! Don’t rile him!” cried Bonavent in an\\nagony.\\n\\n“What? Do you want me to smash up the whole lot?” roared Lupin, in a\\nfurious, terrible voice. “Do I look as if I were bluffing, you fools?”\\n\\n“Let him have his way, master!” cried Dieusy.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!” cried Bonavent.\\n\\n“Let him have his way!” cried another.\\n\\n“Give him his pocket-book!” cried a third.\\n\\n“Never!” howled Guerchard.\\n\\n“It’s in his pocket—his breast-pocket! Be smart!” roared Lupin.\\n\\n“Come, come, it’s got to be given to him,” cried Bonavent. “Hold the\\nmaster tight!” And he thrust his hand into the breast of Guerchard’s\\ncoat, and tore out the pocket-book.\\n\\n“Throw it on the table!” cried Lupin.\\n\\nBonavent threw it on to the table; and it slid along it right to Lupin.\\nHe caught it in his left hand, and slipped it into his pocket. “Good!”\\nhe said. And then he yelled ferociously, “Look out for the bomb!” and\\nmade a feint of throwing it.\\n\\nThe whole group fell back with an odd, unanimous, sighing groan.\\n\\nLupin sprang into the lift, and the doors closed over the opening.\\nThere was a great sigh of relief from the frightened detectives, and\\nthen the chunking of machinery as the lift sank.\\n\\nTheir grip on Guerchard loosened. He shook himself free, and shouted,\\n“After him! You’ve got to make up for this! Down into the cellars, some\\nof you! Others go to the secret entrance! Others to the servants’\\nentrance! Get into the street! Be smart! Dieusy, take the lift with\\nme!”\\n\\nThe others ran out of the room and down the stairs, but with no great\\nheartiness, since their minds were still quite full of the bomb, and\\nLupin still had it with him. Guerchard and Dieusy dashed at the doors\\nof the opening of the lift-well, pulling and wrenching at them.\\nSuddenly there was a click; and they heard the grunting of the\\nmachinery. There was a little bump and a jerk, the doors flew open of\\nthemselves; and there was the lift, empty, ready for them. They jumped\\ninto it; Guerchard’s quick eye caught the button, and he pressed it.\\nThe doors banged to, and, to his horror, the lift shot upwards about\\neight feet, and stuck between the floors.\\n\\nAs the lift stuck, a second compartment, exactly like the one Guerchard\\nand Dieusy were in, came up to the level of the floor of the\\nsmoking-room; the doors opened, and there was Lupin. But again how\\nchanged! The clothes of the Duke of Charmerace littered the floor; the\\nkit-bag was open; and he was wearing the very clothes of\\nChief-Inspector Guerchard, his seedy top-hat, his cloak. He wore also\\nGuerchard’s sparse, lank, black hair, his little, bristling, black\\nmoustache. His figure, hidden by the cloak, seemed to have shrunk to\\nthe size of Guerchard’s.\\n\\nHe sat before a mirror in the wall of the lift, a make-up box on the\\nseat beside him. He darkened his eyebrows, and put a line or two about\\nhis eyes. That done he looked at himself earnestly for two or three\\nminutes; and, as he looked, a truly marvellous transformation took\\nplace: the features of Arsène Lupin, of the Duke of Charmerace,\\ndecomposed, actually decomposed, into the features of Jean Guerchard.\\nHe looked at himself and laughed, the gentle, husky laugh of Guerchard.\\n\\nHe rose, transferred the pocket-book to the coat he was wearing, picked\\nup the bomb, came out into the smoking-room, and listened. A muffled\\nroaring thumping came from the well of the lift. It almost sounded as\\nif, in their exasperation, Guerchard and Dieusy were engaged in a\\nstruggle to the death. Smiling pleasantly, he stole to the window and\\nlooked out. His eyes brightened at the sight of the motor-car,\\nGuerchard’s car, waiting just before the front door and in charge of a\\npoliceman. He stole to the head of the stairs, and looked down into the\\nhall. Victoire was sitting huddled together on a chair; Sonia stood\\nbeside her, talking to her in a low voice; and, keeping guard on\\nVictoire, stood a brown-faced, active, nervous policeman, all\\nalertness, briskness, keenness.\\n\\n“Hi! officer! come up here! Be smart,” cried Lupin over the bannisters,\\nin the husky, gentle voice of Chief-Inspector Guerchard.\\n\\nThe policeman looked up, recognized the great detective, and came\\nbounding zealously up the stairs.\\n\\nLupin led the way through the anteroom into the sitting-room. Then he\\nsaid sharply: “You have your revolver?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the young policeman. And he drew it with a flourish.\\n\\n“Put it away! Put it away at once!” said Lupin very smartly. “You’re\\nnot to use it. You’re not to use it on any account! You understand?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the policeman firmly; and with a slightly bewildered air he\\nput the revolver away.\\n\\n“Here! Stand here!” cried Lupin, raising his voice. And he caught the\\npoliceman’s arm, and hustled him roughly to the front of the doors of\\nthe lift-well. “Do you see these doors? Do you see them?” he snapped.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said the policeman, glaring at them.\\n\\n“They’re the doors of a lift,” said Lupin. “In that lift are Dieusy and\\nLupin. You know Dieusy?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said the policeman.\\n\\n“There are only Dieusy and Lupin in the lift. They are struggling\\ntogether. You can hear them,” shouted Lupin in the policeman’s ear.\\n“Lupin is disguised. You understand—Dieusy and a disguised man are in\\nthe lift. The disguised man is Lupin. Directly the lift descends and\\nthe doors open, throw yourself on him! Hold him! Shout for assistance!”\\nHe almost bellowed the last words into the policeman’s ear.\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said the policeman. And he braced himself before the doors\\nof the lift-well, gazing at them with harried eyes, as if he expected\\nthem to bite him.\\n\\n“Be brave! Be ready to die in the discharge of your duty!” bellowed\\nLupin; and he walked out of the room, shut the door, and turned the\\nkey.\\n\\nThe policeman stood listening to the noise of the struggle in the lift,\\nhimself strung up to fighting point; he was panting. Lupin’s\\ninstructions were whirling and dancing in his head.\\n\\nLupin went quietly down the stairs. Victoire and Sonia saw him coming.\\nVictoire rose; and as he came to the bottom of the stairs Sonia stepped\\nforward and said in an anxious, pleading voice:\\n\\n“Oh, M. Guerchard, where is he?”\\n\\n“He’s here,” said Lupin, in his natural voice.\\n\\nSonia sprang to him with outstretched arms.\\n\\n“It’s you! It IS you!” she cried.\\n\\n“Just look how like him I am!” said Lupin, laughing triumphantly. “But\\ndo I look quite ruffian enough?”\\n\\n“Oh, NO! You couldn’t!” cried Sonia.\\n\\n“Isn’t he a wonder?” said Victoire.\\n\\n“This time the Duke of Charmerace is dead, for good and all,” said\\nLupin.\\n\\n“No; it’s Lupin that’s dead,” said Sonia softly.\\n\\n“Lupin?” he said, surprised.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Sonia firmly.\\n\\n“It would be a terrible loss, you know—a loss for France,” said Lupin\\ngravely.\\n\\n“Never mind,” said Sonia.\\n\\n“Oh, I must be in love with you!” said Lupin, in a wondering tone; and\\nhe put his arm round her and kissed her violently.\\n\\n“And you won’t steal any more?” said Sonia, holding him back with both\\nhands on his shoulders, looking into his eyes.\\n\\n“I shouldn’t dream of such a thing,” said Lupin. “You are here.\\nGuerchard is in the lift. What more could I possibly desire?” His voice\\nsoftened and grew infinitely caressing as he went on: “Yet when you are\\nat my side I shall always have the soul of a lover and the soul of a\\nthief. I long to steal your kisses, your thoughts, the whole of your\\nheart. Ah, Sonia, if you want me to steal nothing else, you have only\\nto stay by my side.”\\n\\nTheir lips met in a long kiss.\\n\\nSonia drew herself out of his arms and cried, “But we’re wasting time!\\nWe must make haste! We must fly!”\\n\\n“Fly?” said Lupin sharply. “No, thank you; never again. I did flying\\nenough last night to last me a lifetime. For the rest of my life I’m\\ngoing to crawl—crawl like a snail. But come along, you two, I must take\\nyou to the police-station.”\\n\\nHe opened the front door, and they came out on the steps. The policeman\\nin charge of the car saluted.\\n\\nLupin paused and said softly: “Hark! I hear the sound of wedding\\nbells.”\\n\\nThey went down the steps.\\n\\nEven as they were getting into the car some chance blow of Guerchard or\\nDieusy struck a hidden spring and released the lift. It sank to the\\nlevel of Lupin’s smoking-room and stopped. The doors flew open, Dieusy\\nand Guerchard sprang out of it; and on the instant the brown-faced,\\nnervous policeman sprang actively on Guerchard and pinned him. Taken by\\nsurprise, Guerchard yelled loudly, “You stupid idiot!” somehow\\nentangled his legs in those of his captor, and they rolled on the\\nfloor. Dieusy surveyed them for a moment with blank astonishment. Then,\\nwith swift intelligence, grasped the fact that the policeman was Lupin\\nin disguise. He sprang upon them, tore them asunder, fell heavily on\\nthe policeman, and pinned him to the floor with a strangling hand on\\nhis throat.\\n\\nGuerchard dashed to the door, tried it, and found it locked, dashed for\\nthe window, threw it open, and thrust out his head. Forty yards down\\nthe street a motor-car was rolling smoothly away—rolling to a\\nhoneymoon.\\n\\n“Oh, hang it!” he screamed. “He’s doing a bunk in my motor-car!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ARSÈNE LUPIN ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.']"
